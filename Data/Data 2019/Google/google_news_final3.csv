Bitwise has published a very thorough study about the bitcoin market, and it offers some disconcerting information for those considering a plunge into the cryptocurrency investment pool. Research carried out on 81 crypto exchanges that were reporting the highest trading volumes (via CoinMarketCap.com) showed that 71 of them were involved in “wash trading”.

Wash trading is a term used to describe a particular process of feeding the market with misleading information, and it is illegal under US law. It may involve a single person buying and selling the same stock, or it can be carried out by a broker and a trader working together to provide fake volume that makes buying or selling the stock more attractive to other investors; in this case bitcoin investors.

The study discovered that out of a huge daily reported bitcoin volume of US$6 billion, only US$273 million of it was actually legitimate trade. The rest of the volume was created by dishonest reporting. Bitcoin's exchange rate with the US dollar has fallen dramatically from its lofty peak of nearly US$20,000, but its value seems to have stabilized to some extent over the last few weeks. The last thing legitimate bitcoin traders need right now is more investors getting jittery about the outlaw nature inherent in a lot of cryptocurrency business.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/streaming-service-twitch-removes-crypto-payment-options-reddit-user-reports,"Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch has evidently removed Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as payment options for subscriptions. The change was reported by a Reddit user on March 23.

The user noted that Twitch had offered an option to pay with BTC and BCH employing BitPay as a payment processor, but has since “removed it in the last couple of weeks as a payment method for all countries.” One user, seemingly outraged, noted that they canceled all of their Twitch subscriptions and sent an assistance ticket to the company.

On March 20, another Reddit user claimed that Streamlabs — a popular streaming software widely used by Twitch users to receive tips — also removed support for cryptocurrency. According to the user, a new version of the software that has been recently released no longer contains support for crypto donations.

Twitch has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment on the move by press time.

In June 2018, major travel booking website Expedia.com confirmed to Cointelegraph that it had also stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for hotels or flights.

As Cointelegraph reported in August 2016, Twitch previously offered Bitcoin as a payment option using Coinbase as a payment processing gateway.

In September last year, the company’s former executive, Matthew DiPietro, joined crypto startup Kin Ecosystem Foundation as its chief marketing officer.",,https://toshitimes.com/chinas-latest-cryptocurrency-rankings-eos-first-tron-second-bitcoin-fifteenth/,"The Chinese CCID Research Institute has for the 11th time published its public ranking of cryptocurrencies. The top three consists of EOS, Tron and Ethereum. Bitcoin arrives at place 15.

What determines the cryptocurrency ranking?

CCID Blockchain Research Institute released its Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index once again. The evaluators look into three main technical aspects of the different blockchains, namely basic technology, application and innovation. The lists consist of the 35 biggest blockchains. What the evaluation shows is that the code update activity has decreased significantly, but the innovation still grows.

Even though the bear market is still hovering like a dark cloud over the cryptocurrency world, companies and blockchains innovate. Big tech companies dig into the new technology, and IBM has over 1500 developers working on more than 500 different projects. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of NYSE, gears up to launch its platform Bakkt in 2019 and Facebook might launch a cryptocurrency soon. These are just a few examples of what is happening. What we see is the price goes down on all cryptocurrencies while the rate of innovation grows.

Which cryptocurrency blockchains are best and why?

Meanwhile, blockchains around the world are making major improvements. Not surprisingly, EOS, Tron and Ethereum are top three because, in terms of usage and application, they are far from its competitors. However, even though the index ranks EOS as number one, TRON has the most use dapp with over 7800 daily users. When it comes to the number of dapps, ethereum took first place by having 1374 dapps while EOS had 314 and Tron 135.

Nevertheless, they all build and innovate in this bear market. Ethereum, for example, recently launched a hard fork successfully. They aim to move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and the upgrade is the first step in that direction. However, EOS has not done as well recently and have some issues with their consensus algorithm, delegated proof-of-stake. A block producer failed to update the black-list which resulted in a breach. A hacker got away with $7,7 million. Nevertheless, they have also released a new version of its software.

While many blockchains make improvements, Bitcoin still holds place 15 which might change in the future if they implement more upgrades, such as the lightning network which grows day by day. However, not all are positive about the lightning network, and a recent story highlights the potential pitfalls.

Meanwhile, one blockchain that makes progress is Cardano. It has failed investors before which might be a reason why it holds the 25th place but might surprise investors in 2019. They are off to a good start in 2019 as they successfully released Cardano 1.5 on the mainnet. All developers agreed on the update which was a major move towards the most anticipated Shelley update. If they succeed, their blockchain might become the safest decentralised blockchain yet created.

Many projects build and improve which is what investors like to see. Even though the price goes down, the rate of technology improves which usually means that the price sooner rather than later will catch up.

The idea of “free” and “no one owns it” aren’t how the real world works

As the mythology goes, Bitcoin was created by no one important with no ulterior motives and no lasting direct control over the project, and to this day cryptocurrencies are supposed to conform to this “pure” ideal of being devoid of ownership and profit, simply existing for the benevolent use by mankind. Reality, however, is a little bit different. Everything costs money, whether it comes in the form of literal financial resources or in expert labor, and things with no owner quickly find themselves under the de facto control of someone anyway. Ultimately, even a well-distributed idea based on publicly-available open-source code develops associated social media accounts and forums, major code repositories, respected websites, and other major points of access that can easily be taken over by lone groups or individuals. Someone also has to work to maintain all of the above and to continue to develop on the project, much of which requires salary, donations, or unsustainable volunteer efforts.

Similarly, the idea of simply being a pure, unbiased fan has a mythical quality as well. Any number of compromising factors can come into play, from having personal relationships with those involved in a certain project and other social pressures to having significant investments, to even having a soft spot for the “look and feel” of a coin’s branding or popular messaging. And naturally, few will remain fans long before investing, adding the financial interest that may not have been there originally. Simply the “first information bias,” where the first opinion formed becomes difficult to shake in the presence of new information, applies here as well.

Pretending vested interest doesn’t exist has led to all sorts of destructive and deceptive practices

Regrettably, not coming clean to these basic realities has led to them manifesting in underhanded ways. Bitcoin development infamously received funding from Blockstream, which influenced the long-term vision to square more tightly with its business model, with coordinated and similarly infamous social media censorship and manipulation. Twitter engaging in behavior in line with the investment interests of its CEO also has recently become apparent. Ripple rebranded its currency (for which it is the sole known creator) to XRP and may have engaged a bot army on social media to both pump the coin and simulate a community-driven project rather than a corporate coin. Digital Currency Group has its influence in a wide variety of projects including one of the more popular exchanges/onramps and one of the largest news outlets in the space, leading to some dicey coverage of projects outside of their purview. The list goes on and on.

None of this should be surprising. What does leave many unsuspecting users and investors blindsided, however, is pretending that cryptocurrency is above this sort of thing.

Direct, shameless disclosure of interest and holdings is the only reasonable approach

Bluntly put, the only way to combat the underhanded approaches and narratives in the space is to dispel the myth of the benevolent unbiased volunteer. Be clear about who owns what, and has a keen interest in seeing what succeed or fail. Be transparent about holdings and employment. And, most importantly, fight the shaming of those who are upfront about their influences. If someone is trying to discredit someone for having a publicly-stated vested interest in a project, that person is probably the one who has something to hide.

There is no shame or stigma in having an alignment of ideas and incentives, and being upfront about them. Here’s my version: I have been philosophically aligned with sound and decentralized money as long as I can remember. I started living partially off of Bitcoin in 2013, completely in 2015, and closed my bank account and got rid of all my non-crypto money. When it was a hardship to continue to do so I switched to using Dash, not because I was a fanboy but because I had no other options other than to return to fiat at the time. I quickly became a fan of Dash and a few months later started to work for the Dash DAO, which I still do to this day. I don’t hold meaningful amounts of anything else and have no stake in crypto companies or other projects. When I speak, now you know my perspective with nothing to hide. Let’s get the rest of the space to be a little more honest.",2019-03-24 14:02:35+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/maidsafe-coin-guide/,"Share this article

What Is MaidSafeCoin?

MaidSafe is a project for a decentralized internet, created in 2006 by Scottish engineer David Irvine. MaidSafe’s concept predates Bitcoin by several years, although it’s still in its alpha phase at the beginning of 2019. When completed, the SAFE network will work similarly to the TOR network, meaning that Internet content is distributed and accessed in a P2P mesh network.

MaidSafecoin is the temporary cryptocurrency coin used for the alpha and beta versions of the SAFE network, which stands for Secure Access For Everyone. MAID itself is an acronym for Massive Array of Internet Disks. The SAFE network was first envisioned in 2006 by MaidSafe to create a decentralized internet that’s safe and fair for everyone. With the FCC dismantling net neutrality in 2018, this goal may be more important than ever.

Using a decentralized internet resists censorship, as servers are harder to find. It’s why pirates switched from the centralized servers of Napster to the decentralized Gnutella and BitTorrent protocols.

Instead of mining, SAFE network users would be sharing system resources just like they control upload and download speeds in today’s BitTorrent clients. However, instead of just network bandwidth, users will also be sharing disk space, memory, and CPU processing power.

To see if MaidSafe can build the decentralized internet Richard Hendricks has been dreaming of for years, let’s start with a breakdown of the MAID and SAFE coins, and the project’s crypto market performance.

MAID Cryptocurrency Summary

There’s no total supply of Maid coins, except by math, which allows approximately 4.3 billion MAID. This is determined mathematically by each coin file being 32 bits, leaving that many possible number combinations. This is true of the SAFE coin, which is a file, but MAID in its current iteration is a cryptocurrency.

Its peak price so far was $1.12, which occurred on January 2, 2018.

The MaidSafeCoin ICO presale occured on April 22, 2014 and 10 percent of the total MAID supply was released to the public, raising $8 million worth of BTC. An additional 15 percent was withheld by the founding development team.

Instead of mining, MaidSafe uses the term “farming,” and there’s a difference between mining and farming. It’s called Proof of Resource.

Instead of solving complex algorithms, farmers essentially act as micro internet servers, storing data for users in vaults. As users access data, farmers are rewarded with SAFE for providing it first. We’ll talk about how this system is encrypted and secured more below. The distribution system uses a random coin generator, and if the coin generated is unowned, it becomes yours.

Vault Elders (the most trusted vaults by consensus) then perform required governance of the SAFE network. This is similar to a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus model

Safecoins are based on an account system and are “network atomic“, meaning that the system stores the balances of all accounts. Transfers are based on the signature of the last owner, which MaidSafe claims is different from the “blockchain mechanism adopted in other projects, such as Bitcoin“. The system is clearly different from Bitcoin’s UTXO’s, but shares some similarities with Ethereum’s accounting system.

MAID is traded on HitBTC, Poloniex, and Cryptopia, along with the OpenLedger DEX. Just under $1 million MAID is traded on a daily basis on cryptocurrency exchanges, and its trading pairs are BTC, ETH, and USDT.

MAID can be stored in the OmniWallet until it’s converted to SAFE upon the mainnet launch. ICO token holders will receive 10% of the SAFE supply, though an additional 5% will be given to the founders and shareholders of the project, meaning they will own one third of the initial supply.



Decentralizing What’s Already Decentralized

If you’re not a networking wizard, you may not be aware that both the internet and cloud are just physical servers somewhere storing information. Facebook is just a website to you, but to Facebook, it’s a series of data centers and server farms – huge buildings housing tens of thousands of computer servers.

The problem with today’s Internet is similar to the problem with analog phone lines before the proliferation of the mobile phone. Back in 1982 a consent decree initiated by a 1974 Department of Justice lawsuit broke up a monopoly AT&T as a telephone service provider had over the Bell Operating Company, which controlled the physical telephone lines.

The breakup resulted in the creation of seven independent companies, one of which ended up purchasing 4 of them and taking over the AT&T brand. The remaining three are owned by Verizon and CenturyLink, who are using high-speed DSL service on those same lines to compete today with ISPs using fiber optic cable lines.

Comcast Xfinity, Time Warner, Charter, Cox, and others are fighting for a monopoly over our internet content, and the FCC’s net neutrality repeal gives them the power to control bandwidth and create pricing tiers for an internet system that looks more like traditional cable.

VPNs and distributed P2P mesh networks like TOR are proposed solutions to stopping these internet service providers from once again controlling our airwaves.

Even if net neutrality is preserved, we’re not out of the water. A small handful of companies, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google hold most of the Internet’s information on their servers. They’re the ones with the most to lose if the ISPs gain control of the Internet. A P2P internet can save us from both the hardware and software tech giants truly controlling our internet.

This is what MaidSafeCoin is tapping into, but if it’s prepared for the task, why has it been under development for twelve years with no working product yet?

The proposed SAFE Network mainnet will need mass adoption to quickly reindex the entire internet, something Google and others have long been working and have decades-long head starts on.

Mesh networking and the PoR ledger work because, as you know if you’ve ever downloaded a torrent or Gnutella file, only small pieces from each file need to be stored on each node – just enough to keep what’s in front of you loading fast enough to not notice it.

It’s a sharding principle similar to how movie files were distributed in RAR directories on forums long before high-speed internet or even Napster. And in piracy is where we see the inherent problem of MaidSafeCoin that kept it stuck in development limbo for over a decade.

Even if it works flawlessly, it’ll face the same paradox the TOR browser and every other proposed P2P mesh network has: network speed and reliability is dependent on adoption, which is dependent upon network speed and reliability.

It’s the opposite of the Bitcoin and Ethereum bottlenecks, where mass user adoption bogged down the system. And one can only wonder if MaidSafe has the marketing power to succeed where soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many others have failed at before.

MaidSafe Summary

Although created before Bitcoin, MaidSafe is clearly hoping hitching a ride on the blockchain bandwagon will lead it to success. The idea of a mesh internet isn’t new – TOR and torrents have used distributed and decentralized methods for years. MaidSafe simply tokenized the process and repacked it into these key ingredients:

MaidSafe (the company) created MaidSafeCoin and MAID token as temporary placeholders during the alpha and beta phases of its SAFE network and SAFE cryptocurrency coin.

Safecoins are used to tokenize transactions on the P2P distributed mesh internet residing on the devices of SAFE network users.

Each user connected to the SAFE network can choose to become farmers that store information in vaults to present to users with available computing resources in exchange for Safecoins.

Tokenizing the distributed internet concept is the new ingredient MaidSafe brings to the table. It’ll be interesting to see if the development team can pull it off. It’ll take strong technology with a lot of marketing dollars behind it. This isn’t a SAFE bet by any means, but if they pull it off, this crypto founding team will have it MAID.",2019-03-24 20:48:12+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/sand-death-and-cryptocurrency-life-in-a-decentralized-syria,"Rachel-Rose O’Leary is a reporter at CoinDesk, covering how cryptocurrencies are being used in areas of economic, social and political unrest.

This article is part of her ongoing dispatches from Rojova, Syria.

I’m writing from the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria.

Known to sympathizers simply as Rojava – meaning West – the predominantly Kurdish region revolted against the Syrian regime in 2012 and achieved its de-facto autonomy as a result.

Since then, it has pioneered a new political model named democratic confederalism, which due to its stateless, decentralized nature, has a natural synergy with blockchain technologies – something that has been a point of research by technologists in the region.

That’s partially why I am here.

I’m also here because, in December, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his retreat from the region, cited the impending defeat of ISIS, and denouncing Syria as the land of endless wars – of “sand and death,” he called it.

The withdrawal has now effectively been reversed, but at the time, many believed Turkey, which shares a border with Northern Syria, would attack (the country has engaged a continuous offensive against the region since 2016).

The concern was that if Turkey seized control, Rojava’s political system would crumble to the totalizing power of nation states. There would be no more resistance, a resistance I’ve come to care greatly about.

I had previously written about the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency in Rojava. I felt that while the region lacks the basic security and resources offered by the West, it has something the West doesn’t have – the opportunity for a new system of governance to be realized.

With this in mind, I spent a little over a month trying to get into the country to volunteer my skills, both in media and crypto, to a new network of technological academies being developed in the region.

On February 25, I arrived at my new home. Here, according to critics, in the process of implementing democratic confederalism, Rojava has succumbed to the pressures of the familiar, whereby the structures of capitalism and its hierarchies are being mimicked in local economies.

Erselan Serdem, the leader of Rojava’s technological development program, would like to redeem this, creating structures that allow ecological, egalitarian economies to thrive – what proponents call “democratic modernity.”

According to Serdem, with the right combination of philosophy and tech, this dream can be realized.

“We are talking about a new form of institution with a high level of technology, that can develop useful tools for society and achieve a good relationship to nature – that’s our aspiration,” Serdem said, adding:

“Decentralized institutions can be supported by parallel, decentralized technologies.”

War vets and social engineers

The academies Serdem is building will be used to train hackers in various decentralized technologies.

For instance, participants will research digital governance, cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions to fairly distribute natural resources. Serdem is still recruiting people into the academies, seeking out those with technical skills across Rojava and also training injured war veterans, starting with basic programming skills.

Currently, there are 30 war vet participants in the program.

Not only is Serdem recruiting throughout Northern Syria, but he’s also enlisting what he calls “social engineers” – politically-oriented hackers and philosophers focused on reshaping technology.

Without these folks, Serdem said, “We have seen how history repeats itself. The current system will have the same destiny.”

Hozan Mamo, a software developer and academy member, echoed what Serdem said, telling CoinDesk through a translator that the technological academies could solve problems that have emerged in civil society.

For instance, he continued, decentralized governance tools could help formalize decision making and keep power in check.

On the other hand, cryptocurrency could be useful as well, Mamo said, since there’s no access to electronic transactions in Rojava. Instead, Rojava’s inhabitants are dependant on cash that is issued by the Syria state – meaning that the region is still economically bound to the regime.

As a first step towards that, Mamo is looking into the feasibility of onboarding local merchants to accepting cryptocurrency.

The ethos of crypto

Still, there’s a good amount of cynicism surrounding the project.

In Rojava, technology has mostly shown its face through social media, and a sudden proliferation of smartphones – mostly carrying Facebook, YouTube and Whatsapp – has had a tangible impact on the social sphere.

The obsessive use of smartphones has led a certain suspicion of technology to develop, which could have a negative impact on the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.

In an effort to combat this, Serdem noted, he intends to use the academies to redefine technology, moving the narrative away from the corporate interest groups that have monopolized social media, network infrastructure and even hardware in the region.

“There are different forms of technology,” he said. “[There is] technology by nation states and the companies, and then there is a resistance movement, that try to discover more ideas against the current system.”

Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies, for instance, qualify as this “resistance tech” – tools developed by oppressed people to take back power throughout history. Within the academies, Serdem would like to see some of this tech, these alternatives, built.

“We can use some of that kind of technology which is created by the resistance movement. Now we are in the beginning, but in the process we will see what forms of technology do we need to have for democratic modernity,” said Serdem.

Mamo believes that by focusing on usability and security, adoption could happen quickly, especially by younger generations. According to him, Rojava’s youth has no shortage of enthusiasm for technology, as well as a strong aptitude for it.

Prior to the revolution, he said, the Syrian regime deliberately held back the development of technology in the region, forbidding its teaching in universities and arresting people that tried to develop their skills.

But the revolution “opened the border” to technology, he said, leading the region to develop rapidly.

Openness to technology isn’t the only thing Serdem and others are trying to push. His academies also have a strong focus on philosophy, specifically the writings of Abdullah Ocalan, the incarcerated political philosopher whose writings inspired the Rojava revolution.

In his writings, Ocalan seeks to fundamentally restructure society by challenging the roots of hierarchy and domination that underpin it.

It’s a philosophy that resonates strongly with the ideologies that many crypto advocates hold and even display in their interest and use of the open-source movement.

In this way, Serdem told CoinDesk, the academies will encourage much of the same.

”We are creating a commune of the technology, to solve technical problems, and at the same time to create the social engineer or the political person in the moral society,” Serdem said, before concluding:

“In Rojava, we are trying to achieve the philosophy of open source, of how to create a society informed by open source.”

Anonymous Player Wins 33 BCH Playing Cashgames

Bitcoin and betting have long been synonymous, with the earliest use cases for the digital currency comprising simple high-low gambling games such as Satoshi Dice. There’s even evidence that Satoshi intended to incorporate a virtual poker game into Bitcoin’s first code. At Bitcoin.com, we’ve maintained this tradition by enabling people to participate in games of chance in which the outcome can be verified. This type of transparency is at the heart of peer-to-peer currencies such as bitcoin cash, which is a natural fit for provably fair gaming. On March 18, one anonymous player tried their luck on one of the Cashgames progressive slots, and won 33 BCH, worth over $5,000.

Cashgames features an array of casino favorites including video poker, blackjack, roulette, craps and keno. There’s also slots and dice, with the latter game akin to the original Satoshi Dice that was once so popular among early bitcoiners. Because Cashgames is powered by BCH, fast and low cost deposits and payouts are guaranteed. Players can try out all of the games in testmode before electing to deposit bitcoin cash and play for real. If you don’t have BCH handy, Sideshift integration will enable you to switch from other cryptocurrencies such as BTC quickly and privately. Alternatively, there is a BTC-based version of the portal called Bitcoin Games.

Win up to 4,000 BCH in One Go

Whether you choose to bet big or stay small on Cashgames is your call. Because of its provably fair setup, the gaming portal gives players confidence in the outcome of each hand played, dice rolled, or roulette wheel spun. While residents of a handful of countries including the U.S. are not allowed to play for real BCH, Cashgames is accessible in most countries where gambling is legal.

There’s some serious sums to be won too: land a royal flush in video poker, and you could be looking at a jackpot in excess of 4,000 BCH. Even if you’re simply curious to see how a cryptocurrency-powered gaming site operates, there’s plenty to keep you rapt. Check out Cashgames and see what you can win at the provably fair site with a 99% return.

If you have tried your hand in crypto trading, you’ve probably also heard of over-the-counter (OTC) trading. This term is not unique to cryptocurrencies: it exists in the world of traditional finance as well, and simply means that trading is done without the supervision of an exchange.

In OTC trading, orders are not publicly listed, and clients only use a broker to trade with each other, without (hopefully) anyone else knowing about the transaction.

Some crypto exchanges are also offering OTC trading and some of their clients may wonder is this service for them and whether they can use it? Hopefully, you’ll find answers below.

Why Use OTC?

What’s the purpose of using an OTC method of purchase instead of a cryptocurrency exchange? Let’s go over a few reasons why some people prefer the former:

Liquidity: exchanges can have lower liquidity than ideal, so if you are looking to invest more, going OTC might be your safest bet;

exchanges can have lower liquidity than ideal, so if you are looking to invest more, going OTC might be your safest bet; Price protection: if you’re looking to buy/sell thousands of BTC, for example, you might well hurt the price if you do it through an exchange. Simply selling it without the transaction showing up elsewhere, can help prevent that;

Skipping exchanges and buying directly from someone can help you keep a low profile, as many already know that Bitcoin is not really anonymous;

If you’re buying a lot of BTC - or any other asset - chances are you want to protect your identity. Skipping exchanges and buying directly from someone can help you keep a low profile, as many already know that Bitcoin is not really anonymous; Exchange Limits: many cryptocurrency exchanges have daily or even monthly trading limits: at Coinbase, you can only invest USD 25,000 per day, while at Kraken, some users can’t withdraw more than USD 20,000 a month.

Having gone through all these perks of using OTC instead of exchanges, it’s obvious that OTCs are best suited for investors who want to invest a lot of money.

For example, in spite of the difficult market in 2018, cryptocurrency finance company Circle said that OTC trades generated nearly USD 24 billion in notional volume last year, while the average OTC trade stood at around USD 2 million.

“OTC is for high-volume trades and is restricted to accredited investors only. It's not a feature that an average customer would benefit from,” a spokesperson from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase told us. Coinbase also has an OTC trading desk since November 2018, and the service is available for users of Coinbase Prime - that is, financial institutions looking to trade with business funds.

“OTC trading creates wide flexibility for companies, unlike ordinary exchanges. Traded assets can perfectly fit the requirements of the consumer with steady conditions and rates. <...> The limited amount of regulations in off exchange trading is bringing more opportunities for new participants which can customize their risk exposure,” said Gilad Raz, CEO of Fokoya, the company behind Blockium, the peer-to-peer trading platform that combines the gaming world and investing.

With the institutional adaptation of crypto assets, the demand for OTC trading has grown in the last few years, confirms Kapil Rathi, Global Head of Trading Markets at AlphaPoint, a provider of software solutions for both primary issuance and secondary trading in the crypto space.

“Large institutions use OTC trading to trade sizeable amount of crypto assets when they can’t find enough interest at their desired price levels,” he said adding that retail or small traders can also benefit from OTC trading to gain exposure to less liquid assets where generally the liquidity is almost non-existent.

The company also provides an eOTC trading platform to brokers and exchanges who operate OTC trading desks, which allows trading of hundreds of cryptocurrencies and supports an end to end OTC trading workflow.

“With this platform, operators can make custom markets for their customers, extend credits and manage settlement with an intuitive user friendly interface,” Rathi said.

Where Can I Find It?

If you have decided to use OTC trading rather than an exchange, you will want to know where to start. There are several options, all tailored to different needs:

Chatrooms and even social media: there are both private and public chatrooms designed for buyers and sellers to find each other, on services such as Telegram, Skype, IRC, and even LinkedIn. As previously reported, hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto trades daily over Skype;

All of these methods have their own drawbacks and risks, especially since most of the time, large sums of money are involved. Although the well-known saying, “never invest more than you can afford to lose,” is often repeated, in this case it bears repeating once more, as well as urging you to do your own research.

Here you can read about 5 Mistakes to avoid when trading crypto in the OTC market.

Drawbacks and Risks

One of the biggest risks of OTC trading is security. From scammers taking advantage of naive traders, to sellers insisting you bring them cash to a predetermined meeting place, there are many risks that could leave you much poorer than you started with - but these are mostly confined to sites such as LocalBitcoins and can be prevented, in most cases, by simply refusing to take part in any deal that seems shady.

Another risk (that can be turned into a positive thing) is the fact that the marketplace is completely open and you’re not bound by exchange prices. You could trade any X amount of Bitcoin for any Y amount of Ethereum, regardless of what the current going rate is, if you want to - and if you can find someone who wants to trade with you. This also means that you may pay much more than the going rate, but you could also strike a bargain.

Liquidity is another concern: if you’re looking to reap all the benefits of OTC trading, you’re presumably eschewing more traditional crypto exchanges for this exact reason - they have nowhere near enough liquidity to cater to your needs. Bitcoin is far from a problem in terms of liquidity and OTC, since many miners are often happy to sell their profits, but altcoins can be difficult. This is why many exchange-provided OTC trading desks offer a very limited range of assets.

Speaking of exchanges, their OTC trading desks have a unique drawback: you have to play by their rules, which are often much more strict than other ways, even though they provide more security for the investor. For example, the minimum threshold for an OTC trade at Poloniex and Bittrex is set at USD 250,000. Binance has a similar restriction, but theirs is crypto-centric: only transactions larger than 20 BTC will be carried out over their OTC. Meanwhile, at Coinbase, you have access to OTC only if you’re using Coinbase Prime - which is a service specifically tailored to institutional investors.",,,,

According to crypto bull Mike Novogratz, one day, Bitcoin’s market cap will surpass that of gold’s.

After the lofty prediction was made, crypto analysts took to Bitcoin price charts hoping to outline the trajectory that could take the first-ever crypto to a market cap of over $7.5 trillion. One crypto analyst, using Bitcoin’s long-term logarithmic growth chart, shows how BTC reaching such a feat is entirely “feasible.”

Mike Novogratz: Bitcoin Market Cap Will “Easily” Surpass Gold

This week, Galaxy Digital CEO and founder Mike Novogratz joined Morgan Creek’s Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano on the Off The Chain podcast he hosts. There, the outspoken crypto bull suggested that Bitcoin could “easily” reach a similar market cap as gold’s $7.5 trillion cap over the course of the next 20 years.

Novogratz added that it would require BTC to “100x” from today’s prices of approximately $3,950, but clarified that crypto investors shouldn’t expect it get there “in the next year or two.” It’s a long-term goal for Bitcoin’s market cap, according to Novogratz.

Bitcoin Price Chart Shows Growth Trajectory to $7.5 Trillion Market Cap

Following Novogratz and his highly-publicized podcast remarks, crypto Twitter began digging into how Bitcoin price might eventually reach the heights discussed by the Galaxy Digital CEO.

Prominent crypto analyst Dave the Wave, known for his analysis of longer-term Bitcoin price charts and trend changes, shared a 50-year chart of BTC’s market cap using the logarithmic growth rate to highlight its path to $7.5 trillion.

Yes, according to the curve…. pic.twitter.com/TxyzgMQ4tt — dave the wave (@davthewave) March 25, 2019

Considering the chart’s growth trajectory, Bitcoin can be expected to peak some time around the year 2045, and from there it will begin to stabilize. At that point, it will become a more realistic store of value and currency due to volatility essentially disappearing from the asset.

At such an astronomical market cap, the price per BTC would be near $360,000 each assuming all BTC is mined by the time the target is reached in 2045. Despite such a seemingly unrealistic number, the $7.5 trillion market cap of BTC would only represent a mere under 2.5% of the entire global wealth, which is currently at $317 trillion according to The Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Report.

If Bitcoin were to absorb much of the world’s transactional value by becoming the global currency for the internet as many believe it may, BTC may eventually reach the potentially “millions” in value that most cryptocurrency investors expect it to. It just won’t happen for another 25 or more years.

According to an update on the HKEX’s website, Bitmain’s case has been moved to a group of “inactive” applications and is now labeled as lapsed, six months after the company filed the prospectus on Sept 26.

If it still wishes to pursue a listing, Bitmain can re-file the application, but the company would be required to provide additional financial records beyond what was included in its initial filing.

According to a listing rule from the HKEX, “the latest financial period reported on by the reporting accountants for a new applicant must not have ended more than six months from the date of the listing documents.” However, the last public filing from Bitmain only covers the period ending June 30, 2018, nearly nine months ago.

The application drew wide attention last fall as Bitmain disclosed eye-popping profit growth over the past several years. For instance, just for the first half of 2018, the mining giant brought home a net profit of nearly $1 billion, after having made over $1 billion for all of 2017.

Despite such rapid growth in the bottom line, reflecting the surging cryptocurrency market of 2017, the HKEX was hesitant to approve applications from Bitmain and its mining rivals Canaan Creative and Ebang, due to the industry’s volatility.

Indeed, in line with the market slump of 2018, Bitmain suffered a loss of about $500 million in the third quarter of last year.

It’s unclear at the moment whether Bitmain is contemplating another attempt any time soon to go public. The company published an announcement on Tuesday stating:

“Bitmain’s listing application to HKex in September 2018 has reached its 6-month expiration date. … We will restart the listing application work at an appropriate time in the future.”

The company also confirmed in the same announcement that its co-founders Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan have stepped down as co-CEOs. Haichao Wang, previously a director of product engineering at Bitmain, was officially appointed Bitmain’s CEO, months after news report said a management shakeup was in the works.

But if it does not find another way to go public, the company may be on the hook to repay more than $700 million to its venture capital investors.

$700 million redeemable

As of June 30, 2018, Bitmain had a $715 million liability on its balance sheet labeled “redeemable, convertible and preferred shares,” resulting from its Series A and Series B funding rounds closed over the past two years. This amount accounted for nearly half the company’s total liabilities at the time.

According to the company’s IPO prospectus, the terms Bitmain agreed to with these investors included a redemption clause, which gives shareholders the right to require Bitmain to redeem or repurchase all or part of their shares if either one of two events happens.

One such situation is “neither a qualified [REDACTED] nor a qualified trade sale defined in the terms has occurred by the fifth anniversary of the preferred shares’ issue date,” the document says. The other is the occurrence of a breach by the company or its controlling shareholders that has a “material adverse effect” on the firm’s overall businesses and “has not been cured within 30 days as defined in the terms.”

Shirley Wang, a partner at the law firm of Baker McKenzie FenXun with expertise in debt capital markets, said such redemption clauses are a common and typical way to protect investors and it’s not unusual for investors to initiate a redemption procedure. But the conditions under which redemption rights can be exercised vary from deal to deal, she added.

While it’s unclear what exact type of event was redacted from the passage in Bitmain’s prospectus, a clue can be found in a term sheet for Bitmain’s B+ round, in which the firm raised $440 million.

According to a copy of that document obtained by CoinDesk, investors have the right to redeem all or part of the B+ preferred shares at any time after the earlier of:

“i) 5 years from the closing date (if no qualified IPO), or ii) upon any breach by any Group company or any founder parties of the terms of the transaction documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which amounts of a material adverse effect and is not cured within 30 days.” [Emphasis added]

Under such conditions, Series B+ round investors could require Bitmain to redeem the shares in an amount equal to the purchase price plus “all declared and unpaid dividends” and “an assumed 10% compounded” annual return for each year such shares are outstanding from the closing date, less any amount received by the investors.

This term sheet further specified what a qualified IPO means for Bitmain’s B+ round investors, stating:

“Qualified IPO is defined as an underwritten public offering of ordinary shares of the Company at a public offering price per share (prior to underwriting commissions and expenses) that values the Company at least US$18 billion in an offering of not less than $500 million).”

Although the amount of money Bitmain intended to raise from the IPO was also redacted from the HKEx prospectus, documents obtained by CoinDesk last summer indicated the proceeds would have been as high as $18 billion at a market capitalization of $40 to $50 billion.

There are 2,121 digital currencies tracked on market websites with a net valuation of around $140 billion. Statistics for the end of Q1 2019 show mineable digital assets to be the most valuable cryptocurrencies on the market today, with the top eight mineable coins representing 68 percent of the entire cryptoconomy.

Mineable Cryptocurrencies Capture Close to 70% of the Market

There are a lot of cryptocurrencies these days but only a handful have a significant fiat value and a large community of supporters. Currently, there are only four cryptocurrencies within the top 10 market capitalizations that are mineable. The remainder have already been minted like Ripple’s XRP, Stellar’s XLM, various initial coin offerings and a few that use the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The four cryptocurrencies in the top 10 (BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH) that can be mined have a combined market cap of around $91.7 billion. These coins constitute approximately 65.5 percent of the entire crypto ecosystem’s net worth. The rest of the top 10 non-mineable cryptos are worth a combined total of about $24 billion, which is 17 percent of the whole economy.

Moreover, there are only eight mineable cryptocurrencies within the top 20 crypto market capitalizations. The coins joining BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH include BSV, XMR, DASH, and ETC. These mineable cryptos are worth $3.32 billion or 2.2 percent of the entire economy’s valuation. The eight combined mineable coins capture around 67.7 percent dominance and are worth far more than 2,100 other cryptos. All of the top coins that are mineable can be mined by anyone with a standard GPU and ASIC machine. Coins like XMR and ETH have community members who believe in some form of ASIC resistance and when LTC first launched it was supposed to be ASIC resistant but that goal failed almost immediately.

Certain Mining Pools Have Skin in the Game Across Several Cryptocurrency Networks

One interesting fact is that all of the four mineable coins in the top 10 have the same mining pools processing coins. Both BTC and BCH have a great overlap of mining pools that process coins on both networks including organizations such as BTC.com, Antpool, Bitcoin.com, and Viabtc. Similarly, the LTC network has some overlap with both the BTC and BCH networks with pools like F2pool, Antpool, Poolin, and Viabtc.

It’s also worth noting that on all three networks these woven sets of mining pools have dominant shares of hashrate in each network. ETH, on the other hand, has very little overlapped pools except for the prominent F2pool capturing a large chunk of ETH’s hash power. At the end of this year’s first quarter, both BTC and BCH have a decent amount of unknown miners. Currently unknown miners processing BCH capture roughly 19.4 percent of the network hashrate. Meanwhile, unidentified miners on the BTC chain have about 23.9 percent of the current hashrate.

There’s a wide variety of coins these days, many of whose teams criticize mineable cryptos for ‘wasting’ resources. This is a huge talking point for certain pre-mined coins that ditch the proof-of-work consensus algorithm but data clearly shows mineable assets are close to two-thirds more valuable than non-mineable tokenized assets. The public can also see that a good portion of the world’s top mining pools diversify their hashrate, demonstrating the faith they hold in these mineable digital assets.

Twitch is the latest major corporation to stop accepting payments in bitcoin, the world's most-valuable cryptocurrency. | Source: Shutterstock

When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the historic bitcoin whitepaper, the elusive creator called bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. But ten years later, bitcoin is still a terrible way to pay for things.

Streaming platform Twitch just proved the point by quietly removing its bitcoin and bitcoin cash payment options. The Amazon-owned streaming platform offered no reasons for the move, but we can read between the lines. There’s no demand.

Don’t get me wrong. I would love to see bitcoin become the world’s payment system, but it faces some serious issues. And it’s not because of speed or fees or technology. It’s because of the stupid way the government taxes bitcoin. Let’s get deeper into this.

Twitch Ditches Bitcoin

Twitch is the latest bitcoin-accepting vendor to drop its support for cryptocurrencies. The news was first circulated by one Redditor who posted:

“[Twitch] had an option to pay through Bitpay. They removed it in the last couple of weeks as a payment method for all countries. Negative adoption strikes again unfortunately.”

CCN.com can confirm that Twitch did previously offer bitcoin as a payment method for subscriptions. The screenshot tweet below clearly displays the bitcoin logo.

At the time of writing on Monday 25th March, the bitcoin payment option is no longer available.

Twitch isn’t the only high-profile company to ditch bitcoin support. One of the world’s largest travel companies Expedia dropped its support for crypto payments in 2018. And after initially accepting cryptocurrency payments, the Fortnite gaming store pulled the payment option claiming the whole thing was an accident.

Bitcoin Payments Crashed 80% Through 2018

The latest Twitch development is no real surprise. Bitcoin payments dropped 80% last year. As the price crashed, people stopped using bitcoin to pay for things. The damning Chainalysis report surveyed 17 payment processors, including BitPay which powered the Twitch crypto payments.

It’s a clear sign that people simply don’t want to use bitcoin to make payments.

Why Bitcoin Sucks as a Payment Option

Most people blame bitcoin’s poor speed and high fees for lack of payment adoption. But that’s not the main problem. In fact, the Lightning Network means bitcoin micropayments are now possible with almost zero fees and instant settlements.

The problem is the stupid way bitcoin is taxed. The US government taxes bitcoin as property, which means it’s subject to capital gains tax.

So if you buy a coffee using bitcoin, you instantly owe tax on any gains you made. That’s ridiculous. For every bitcoin payment, you need to keep a record of the transaction and what your profit or loss was. As CNBC explains:

“If you unloaded bitcoin in any way last year — by selling it, gifting it to a friend or using it to buy anything from pizza to a Lamborghini — you’re triggering a “taxable event.” And you’re then responsible for paying taxes on the appreciation of the virtual currency from the price at which you bought it, to the price at which you sold (or spent) it.”

People Won’t Spend Bitcoin Until This Changes

Bitcoin’s main roadblock to payment adoption isn’t the speed or technology, it’s this short-sighted tax law. On top of that, bitcoin holders aren’t likely to spend their bitcoin right now when the price has declined so deep below their initial investment.

I still believe that using bitcoin for payments will trigger the next bull-run. But until these things change, it won’t happen.",2019-03-25 08:53:22+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/wine-mountains-and-mining-rigs-georgia-as-a-crypto-powerhouse,"The former Soviet republic of Georgia, which occupies picturesque mountain valleys and rugged ridges of the Southern Caucasus, has roughly the same population as the state of Connecticut. It is renowned as the birthplace of Joseph Stalin, as well as for being one of the oldest wine regions in the world, its rich and eclectic cuisine, and, more recently, for hosting the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency mining operation.

Additionally, an estimated 5% of the nation’s households are engaged in mining crypto or invested in it. Back in 2016, the Georgian government was the first to create an operational blockchain-powered system for property rights registration, which by mid-2018 had hosted more than 1.3 million electronic documents. State officials are now looking to move all government registries to distributed ledgers.

Sounds like crypto-buff’s dream, doesn’t it? For a small nation, though, the place in the front row of fintech pioneers comes at a cost. A single entity, the Netherlands-based blockchain software and hardware provider Bitfury, is responsible for much of Georgia’s current crypto momentum. The company chose to cast anchor in the Alazani Valley for the friendly investment climate and abundance of hydropower on which it heavily relies. However, critics among the Georgian political opposition think that Bitfury was able to negotiate excessively favorable terms with the government, leading to diminished tax revenues and even increase in electricity tariffs nationwide.

The warm welcome

Bitfury Group was founded in 2011 by a Latvian entrepreneur Valery Vavilov, whose bio on the company’s website mentions his first-hand experience with the “challenges resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union.” Although the company is incorporated in Amsterdam, the natives of the post-Soviet space are heavily represented among its leadership. Apparently, Bitfury’s С-suite were quite familiar with both the challenges and opportunities that the region presents, as well as with ins and outs of doing business in the area.

Vavilov first arrived in Georgia to talk business in 2013; in July 2014, Bitfury’s first 20 megawatt data center emerged in the eastern Georgian city of Gori. In December of the following year, a major expansion nearly tripled the company’s mining capacity in the country, as Bitfury deployed its 16 nm ASIC chips at a new facility in the area called Gldani, within the city limits of the capital, Tbilisi. This outpost became the first resident of the newly developed Free Industrial Zone, which was designed to attract technology companies by perks such as an exemption from the 18% value-added tax (VAT). The company purchased 18 hectares of land for a symbolic price of 1 lari, which amounts to a fraction of $1. The new data center’s featured a new proprietary cooling technology: Its computers were submerged in tanks of nonconductive fluid while racing to seal the block.

As Bitfury arrived in 2014, the Georgian Co-Investment Fund, linked to the country’s wealthiest person and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, provided the firm with a $10 million installation allowance, according to The New York Times. Although both Bitfury and Ivanishvili’s representatives have repeatedly stated that the loan has been repaid even before the Gldani facility opened, the rumors of the billionaire remaining one of the main beneficiaries of the project never subsided. At any rate, the two entities maintained at least an interlocking directorate connection, as Bitfury’s board member George Kikvadze held a senior office with the Co-Investment Fund and had stepped down from the GCIF in 2015, according to a Bitfury spokesperson speaking to Cointelegraph.

The relationship between the government and the mining behemoth briskly progressed, and in April 2016, Valery Vavilov and the chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry made public their plan to create a blockchain-powered land registry system. The following year, Georgia made history in becoming the first nation to implement distributed ledger technology for securing and validating government records.

In February 2018, Bitfury announced that it was selling the Gldani data center to Chong Sing Holdings, a Hong-Kong based fintech company, citing the need to continue its “successful expansion in the Asian market of both hardware and software solutions.” However, in just a few months, the facility went back under the original proprietor’s control: Amid plunging prices and increasing regulatory pressures in China, Chong Sing found itself rushing to hedge its risks and cut down exposure to crypto assets. Bitfury was able to get the Gldani facility back at a discount. Despite the lingering bear market, the company still reports profit and remains bullish on Bitcoin in the long run.

The Bitcoin dream

Whether it was due to Bitfury raising the profile of the mining enterprise or people being able to figure it out regardless, the ordinary Georgians have had their fair share of the crypto craze. Hundreds of thousands of rigs joined the race before the market went steeply downhill, driving the share of mining in Georgia’s electricity bill to a staggering range between 10% and 15%. Despite the government’s general blockchain-friendly, low-regulation stance, toward the end of 2017, financial authorities grew concerned with the scale of the gold rush and had to remind Georgians that Bitcoin was still not a legal tender, and recommend to exercise caution when staking their livelihood on crypto.

The nation’s Bitcoin exuberance at the peak of the Great Bull Run was understandable: It seemed that the combination of the state’s openness to crypto and cheap electricity available across the board was going to bring about prosperity. The industrious folk rushed to the remote highland areas, where state-subsidized electricity was available for free. A political party emerged that proclaimed its ambition to push ahead with the idea of creating a national cryptocurrency, which would allow every citizen to benefit from the country’s pool of unused resources.

Yet, with the crypto prices in free-fall, the future of rank-and-file miners looks a lot bleaker. Where Bitfury can still reap the fruits of massive economies of scale, cutting-edge technology, and tax exemptions, Bitcoin hunters with rigs in their garages are increasingly likely to find themselves unable to turn any profit. And as the crypto dream gives way to tough reality, the question looms large again: Is the model of blockchain development that Georgian leadership is pursuing sustainable in the long run?

Decentralizing the field

Georgia is small and not particularly wealthy, so offering lavish concessions to a major player in the industry that has a big promise is a defensible strategy. The choice here is not between welcoming one large firm and hosting a vibrant diverse fintech sector, it is more likely between the former and not being on the blockchain map at all. This could be “high-tech gambling,” as Gocha Tutberidze, a professor at the European University in Tbilisi, told NPR, yet this could be the only possible entry point.

Strategically, mining might not be the most rewarding of the crypto-related industries to host. This business is built on extracting resources without necessarily building lasting infrastructure, relationships or technology that will benefit the territory when all is said and done. Energy consumption is a serious consideration, too: While electricity supply and demand must be calculated in plenty of time, crypto prices’ volatility introduces a lot of uncertainty on the demand side.

In late December 2018, Abkhazia, a contested state that United Nations recognizes as part of Georgia, but which is de-facto independent from the government in Tbilisi, instituted a blanket ban on cryptocurrency mining. The move was motivated by the officials’ fear of possible electricity shortages if temperatures fall too low.

As Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for Europe and Central Asia, pointed out in an interview to Forbes Georgia, creating a level playing field for all fintech players will eventually require a more structured regulatory framework. This is a necessary condition for the next step on the path of blockchain leadership that the country aspires to take. It is now incumbent upon the nation’s policymakers and industry leaders to make sure that Georgia grows from being a mining hub to a dynamic center of fintech innovation, where a host of smaller firms compete do deliver consumer-oriented technologies and solutions.

Thus, Bitfury is based in the Netherlands and not in the United States, while its board member does not currently hold a senior position at the Georgian Co-Investment Fund, having stepped down from it in 2015.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-blockchain-bitcoin-idUSKCN1R703A,"TBILISI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After years spent farming money in his uncle’s basement in Tbilisi, Georgian tech entrepreneur Shota Siradze turned over the dingy space to a more traditional crop: tomatoes.

Until November, the dark cellar underneath his family’s Soviet apartment block had served as an unlikely head office to Siradze’s thriving cryptocurrency business.

The cellar was one of many moribund spaces - garages, farms and warehouses - that had taken on a new life as Georgia fell in love with bitcoin and triggered a virtual gold rush.

Bitcoin began circulating in 2009 as an electronic currency operating outside the traditional banking system.

It is created as payoff for solving a run of complex sums that are used to verify transactions on blockchain - the system underpinning the currency - and is stored online.

Bitcoin’s value has ranged from a fraction of a dollar to nearly $20,000 in its short life, spawning countless copycat currencies and many millionaires.

But as the virtual coins slumped to a current low of about $4,000, Siradze’s operation became unprofitable, forcing the 29-year-old and his business partner to reconsider their options.

“As prices went down, we started thinking about alternatives and came up with this,” said Siradze, pointing at two rows of tomatoes ripening on the vine under artificial light inside a room heated by a cryptocurrency mining computer.

A few tomatoes will not a fortune make, but it keeps the space occupied and machines busy earning a bit of spare change.

CRYPTO CAPITAL

Georgia, a former Soviet republic of 4 million people, became a global cryptocurrency powerhouse in the past five years as cheap energy, tax breaks and business-friendly regulations spurred investment, according to the World Bank.

Global tech firm Bitfury, a world leader in blockchain, set up shop in Georgia in 2014. In its wake, as the value of cryptocurrencies soared, a crypto craze ignited locals.

Thousands began mining: the process of producing bitcoins by solving maths problems with high-powered computers. Bitcoin cash machines appeared in Tbilisi as cryptocurrency operations took root, injecting life in often abandoned buildings.

Last year, the World Bank estimated about 5 percent of Georgian families were involved in the business, which sucked up almost 15 percent of the country’s energy demand, making it the world’s third largest producer of cryptocurrencies.

The slump in bitcoin’s value, however, meant revenue from mining no longer even covered the energy costs, forcing many to halt operations, said Vano Narimanidze, a co-founder of Association Blockchain Georgia networking group.

About 80 percent of all mining ventures in Georgia turned off the lights, said Narimanidze, and many rooms that had buzzed with computer fans fell still once more.

“People sold their houses, their cars, to buy (currency) miners and some of them were lucky enough to get back the money they put in,” said Siradze. “But most of them lost out.”

Only big businesses and those operating in tax-free zones or areas where electricity is cheap are still running, he added.

END OF THE PARTY

Siradze and his partner Irakli Pruidze had to pull the plug.

The two former IT workers owned a few processors of their own and ran a consultancy helping others to set up mining farms in exchange for a share of their profits.

One farm occupied the top floor of a disused warehouse inside a historic brandy factory in Tbilisi.

It folded in November.

Most machines were sold, the rest lie idle, collecting dust alongside a Stalin bust and a few Soviet-era posters.

A few kilometers away, another 1,000 miners - a group of processing units - lie unused inside a disbanded electronics factory that had briefly buzzed as a data center.

“This was an old useless factory of spare parts that stopped working after the fall of the Soviet Union. We gave it a new function but unfortunately not for a long time,” said cryptocurrency businessman Lasha Khanishvili.

RE-INVENTION

While some entrepreneurs have simply switched off their machines hoping value might bounce back, others have found new uses for their machines and spaces.

“You can just wait - or do something else while waiting,” said Siradze.

Narimanidze, of the Association Blockchain Georgia, sold three miners that had each earned him about $40 a day in 2018, and kept three more in his family’s rural home.

“They keep the house warm in winter,” he said.

Excess heat generated by computer servers has long been a problem for cryptocurrency miners worldwide, with media reports citing a host of innovative uses for all that hot air, be it drying strawberries or powering radiators.

Siradze and 30-year-old Pruidze opted for tomatoes.

Using LED lights and hydroponic technology, which replaces soil with water, they set up a mini farm in their basement office, growing 10 plants that have produced about 6 kilos of since autumn, only worth about $30 at retail price.

“We want to go bigger,” said Siradze, who hopes to expand his basement allotment into the rooftops and join a growing global trend for urban farming.

Other green-thumbed miners have launched similar efforts in Canada and the Czech Republic, according to media reports, and Siradze voiced some of the same entrepreneurial excitement that once powered his beloved bitcoin to highs.

“You can heat up 100 square meters with 10 miners ... if you sustain them with solar power or wind power you’ll get free coins, free heat and free tomatoes,” he said.

The exchange has initiated a pre-launch campaign and also started the onboarding process for its potential clients.

According to the announcement, the Japanese exchange will start accepting clients from May 25 and close the process on April 17. As a part of the promotional campaign, the exchange is offering JPY 1,000 to its 500 random future clients, if they trade more than JPY 250,000 worth digital assets.

Japan is one of the biggest markets for digital asset trading. It, however, faced a setback in 2018 amid the massive attack on Coincheck, which at the time was handling the highest number of crypto trades in the country. The attack, which resulted in the theft of $536 million worth of digital coins, had alerted the country’s financial watchdog, which in turn, tightened its grip on the unregulated market.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) also made it mandatory for exchanges operating within its jurisdiction to gain a license. Taotao is one of the few exchanges that has received the FSA license to list virtual currencies against fiat.

Buterin made his comments during a keynote speech at the RadicalxChange conference in Detroit, Michigan on March 24, BreakerMag reported on March 25.

Buterin had jointly initiated RadicalxChange with economist Glen Weyl, co-author of the book “Radical Markets,” which argues in favor of rethinking markets from within an emboldened and radicalized liberal perspective as an antidote to neoreaction, populism and protectionism.

In his speech, Buterin argued that today’s crypto advocates and developers should evolve away from the fierce individualism of the cypherpunk movement and from an excessive focus on maximizing autonomy and privacy.

Money, he argued, is fundamentally and profoundly social, and the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is to advance an explicitly political, collective agenda. This, he argued, includes rethinking models of social governance, formalizing identity and community membership, facilitating the equitable funding of public goods, and rehauling ownership structures.

Buterin pitched cryptocurrencies and blockchain — and more fundamentally, the creative and astute use of technology to tackle concrete politico-economic goals — as a way out of the contemporary impasse. Critics of the status quo, he claimed, advocate for either a “1950’s-style centrally planned statism” on the left, or “free-market capitalism with slightly more welfare” among centrists. “Both of these ideas,” he argued, represent “intellectual dead ends.”

Noting that the invention of Bitcoin represents a powerful movement against state and central bank hegemony, he proposed that smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, as well as governance-focused blockchains, can help realize its originary revolutionary impulse to the full.

As Cointelegraph has reported, Satoshi Nakamoto — the much-mythologized, anonymous inventor of Bitcoin — notoriously embedded the coin’s genesis block with a Times headline from January 2009 about the United Kingdom bank bailout.

The challenges of creatively expanding Nakomoto’s vision were acknowledged by Buterin in a recent speech, in which he noted that non-financial blockchain applications continue to face more difficulty gaining traction. Among his personal commitments, he said, was redrawing the existing technology and power landscape by creating a decentralized ecosystem that would allow smaller players to compete with incumbent monopolies.",

Digital asset ratings unit Weiss Crypto Ratings studied 122 cryptocurrencies across the market using a variety of metrics. The report seeks to dispel what it describes as a misunderstanding amongst observers who “seem to assume there’s been an industry-wide decline in usage and practical applications.”

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” declared Weiss. “Leading cryptocurrencies now enjoy three times more volume in user (on-chain) transactions than they did in early 2018. The industry’s network capacity and security have improved dramatically. And the underlying technology has evolved with new, more efficient ways to create digital assets.”

But while Weiss noted a marked improvement in the technology of many projects, the highest “Weiss Rating” assigned to any cryptocurrency was a “B-” (good). This grade was shared by EOS, XRP, Bitcoin, and Binance’s BNB; although the latter came with a disclaimer: “Binance’s ‘B-‘ is influenced by a recent price surge, which may not be sustainable.”

The rest of the rankings featured 27 cryptocurrencies with an overall rating in the C-range (fair), 75 coins in the D-range (weak), and 16 in the E-range (very weak).

Bitcoin, formerly ranked C+, was bumped up after Weiss recognized improvements to its infrastructure, such as the Lightning Network.

EOS and XRP were said to merit a B-, primarily due to high scores in Weiss’ technology and adoption metrics. Curiously, the second most popular cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, didn’t even make the top five.

Hard Fork spoke with Weiss Crypto Ratings’ chief analyst Juan Villaverde to better understand how it came to these conclusions, as well as how critical factors like consensus and decentralization factor into the firm’s methods.

The four factors of Weiss’ crypto currency rating system

Weiss published two top 10 lists: one that considers possible risks and rewards associated with investing in cryptocurrency, and one not so concerned.

Disregarding the risks involved with investing in digital assets resulted in higher grades for pretty much every top cryptocurrency.

“Investors must not ignore the risk of loss, which remains far higher in crypto markets than virtually any other asset class,” reads the report. “Thus, the overall Weiss Crypto Ratings, which include risk and reward factors, are lower than the Weiss Tech/Adoption grades.”

The list on the left below includes considerations related to potential risks associated with investing in these digital assets, and the other doesn’t.

Much better without those pesky risks

Villaverde told Hard Fork the process behind these ratings is proprietary to Weiss, but he did share some insight into its four metrics: technology, adoption, risk, and reward.

The technology model evaluates the potential of a cryptocurrency to achieve a variety of goals, like “transaction speeds and other scaling solutions, energy efficiency, sophistication of monetary policy, decision-making capabilities, flexibility to upgrade, sophistication of smart contracts.”

Adoption relates to a blockchain‘s real-world network security, network capacity, speed, scalability, market penetration, decentralization of block production, dev participation, public acceptance, and estimated energy consumption.

Finally, Weiss’ risk and reward models measure price fluctuations, frequency and magnitude of “peaks and troughs,” market bias, as well as overall returns on investment compared to certain benchmarks.

Okay, but where does decentralization fit in to all this?

All these factors certainly seem important – but one glaring exclusion is decentralization. Included in Weiss’ top 10 are a high number of cryptocurrency projects that operate by trusting considerably fewer network participants than Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Many listed projects have less than 100 validators on their networks. In EOS’ case, it’s 21, and NEO’s network is as small as seven fully validating nodes. Ethereum has almost 9,000 securing its blockchain, and Bitcoin has more than 10,000.

Villaverde explained that decentralization can mean different things. “In the adoption model, we look at how the ledger is secured (how blocks are added, for instance) and who is involved in that process. Security (in the adoption model) involves how resistant the ledger is to double-spends.”

This makes sense, but only for those blockchains using the PoW consensus algorithm. So, how Weiss defines and weighs decentralization depends on how (and by who) transactions are confirmed on a particular network.

“In PoW ledgers, for example, it evaluates how difficult it is to acquire 51 percent of the hashrate. In Proof-of-Stake [(PoS)] coins, although there’s many variants of that consensus model, the primary issue is how easy it is to acquire a controlling stake,” he said. “Other ledgers are secured in different ways but the fundamental principal is the same: How could a malicious actor acquire the capability to double-spend on the network?”

Villaverde told Hard Fork that Weiss considers the number of network validators to be just one part of the equation, as the issue of security and how a distributed ledger reaches consensus is complex, and it varies on each network.

“Attempting to reduce these issues to just one simple number is why we find there is so much disagreement among industry leaders. And it is also why our models use a wide variety of sub-models to address these issues,” he noted. “In the case of EOS or NEO, for example, what matters most is who controls the stake to elect those validators. EOS has fewer controlling parties than 21.”

“Ethereum or Bitcoin have a large number of nodes but these do not write the ledger; they only validate what miners are doing,” Villaverde continued. “There are a small number of miners who control the overwhelming majority of hashrate, however. If these miners were to collude, they could ultimately cripple their networks, even if those ‘listening’ nodes chose to ignore them.”

It must be mentioned that while Ethereum is currently powered by PoW, its core development community has been intent on shifting the network to a PoS consensus algorithm called Casper. It’s been a very slow process.

But hang on: isn’t EOS more of a cloud computing service?

Last year, blockchain researchers (commissioned by Ethereum powerhouse ConsenSys) investigated the EOS blockchain thoroughly with a rigid set of tests to benchmark its underlying technology.

The published results were pretty damning. Not only did the researchers find EOS is more of a glorified cloud computing service than a “real” blockchain, but analysis deemed it impossible for EOS to protect itself against cartels forming in the system, which would throw the integrity of the network in disarray.

“We thoroughly review this type of research but seek to filter out commentary that is driven by ideology or an intellectual commitment to certain approaches,” Villaverde told Hard Fork. “For example, some claim that a ‘real blockchain‘ must be PoW. Bitcoin ‘maximalists’ argue every project is a scam except for Bitcoin. Others say Bitcoin and Ethereum are ‘real’ but the rest are ‘illegitimate.'”

“Overall, we have yet to see a universally accepted definition of a ‘real’ blockchain. For these reasons, we keep an open mind. We don’t claim to know what a ‘real’ blockchain is, or what ‘true decentralization‘ means,” said Villaverde. “Nor do we believe strict definitions are desirable. Rather, our model analyzes all facets from several perspectives, while removing personal opinion and bias from the ratings process.”

Weiss’ report also contained recent statistics that showed the EOS network has been processing more than 4.5 million transactions per day, just in front of WAX (another “Delegated Proof-of-Stake” blockchain).

Unfortunately, it stopped short of providing further details as to what dapps specifically could be driving the high amounts of new traffic, other than referring to these numbers as proof of increased adoption within the industry.

It’s worth pointing out that data shows a large chunk of that traffic has been coming from gambling dapps.

“We haven’t done studies on the data because like we mentioned we don’t really discriminate [between transaction ‘quality’] for the time being,” commented Villaverde. “A cursory review will reveal that most volume is going to gambling and gaming dapps… that (sadly?) seems to be the niche crypto and smart contract platforms have found so far.”

These ratings might not reflect your favorite coins, but they do provide a unique overview of the cryptocurrency market, and from the perspective of who can be suitably described as an industry-outsider in Weiss. The firm did not begin in blockchain, but it’s part of it now, and it’s weighing in.

If you have ever bought bitcoin, chances are that you placed your order in a specific, deliberate increment. Maybe you bought $25 or $100 worth of the cryptocurrency, or perhaps 1 or 2 bitcoins. (At the moment, one unit of the cryptocurrency costs about $4,000.)

Predictable purchasing patterns like these are apparent in the order books of legitimate crypto exchanges. Transactions around whole numbers and activity corresponds to customers’ sleep-wake schedules. As shown in the histogram below, bitcoin is frequently purchased in whole amounts:

Bitwise Asset Management An exchange whose volume is considered legitimate.

However, exchanges suspected of artificial trading activity often lack these markers of human trading. Instead, they reflect purchases that are evenly distributed across order sizes.

Bitwise Asset Management An exchange whose volume is considered suspicious.

Close to 95% of reported bitcoin trading is fake, claims Bitwise, a San Francisco-based crypto index fund provider. The firm is currently lobbying (pdf) the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin. To convince the agency, Bitwise claims it can sift through the noise and focus on the much smaller but authentic bitcoin market.

Another indicator of artificial volume is buy and sell orders that occur in pairs. Note CoinBene’s alternating red and green market trades on the far right of the graphic below. This is similar to alternating heads and tails on coin flips. It suggests that the trading activity is not being randomly generated by users.

Bitwise Asset Management Alternating buy and sell orders suggest artificial activity.

Actual trading behavior is predictably, well, unpredictable. Buy and sell streaks vary in duration, says Bitwise.

Bitwise Asset Management Streaky activity is much more indicative of human-generated trades.

The incident— described as “attacks from hackers” that resulted in the transfer and theft of both “users’ [...] and Platform crypto assets,” reportedly occurred on March 24, and was immediately detected by DragonEx. An admin from the exchange notified users that:

“Part of the assets were retrieved back, and we will do our best to retrieve back the rest of stolen assets. Several Judicial administrations were informed about this cyber crime case including Estonia, Thailand, Singapore, HongKong etc. and we’re assisting policemen to do investigation. All platform services will be closed and the accurate assets loss recovery situation will be announced in a week.”

The admin adds that in regard to user losses, “DragonEx will take the responsibility no matter what.” As of press time, the amount of cryptocurrency involved is unknown.

A second admin post warned users that official DragonEx customer services support never requests sensitive information such as “passwords, Email verification code, GA code, SMS code, and private key for transfer.” The post advised vigilance against suspect communications and provided contact details for users to seek official assistance in regard to safeguarding the integrity of private data.

In a further post today, March 26, an exchange admin issued an update to the Telegram channel identifying 20 wallet addresses to which the stolen assets are believed to have been transferred. Each address appears to correspond to a unique cryptocurrency — 20 addresses for 20 different cryptos — among them Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), EOS, Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) addresses, as well as numerous other large and smaller market cap altcoins.

The update appeals to channel readers, stating:

“We earnestly request help from all our fellow exchanges and other industry strength, please help us to investigate and traced the assets, freeze them and stop the assets flows.”

On Monday, the Helsinki-based peer-to-peer crypto exchange Localbitcoins announced it is adding several different identification processes in order to improve AML and KYC requirements. The move to bolster the new customer verification procedure follows Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) mandating supervision over exchange operations.

Localbitcoins Adds a New Verification Process Due to Regulatory Guidelines

The BTC trading platform Localbitcoins specializes in peer-to-peer and over-the-counter bitcoin exchange throughout nearly every major city in the world. Years ago, the Helsinki operation was well known for providing a platform that allowed people to trade in a private fashion. In those days, traders could swap fiat for bitcoins or vice versa without the KYC processes involved with other exchanges. However, over the last two years, Finland’s regulations and newly introduced policies have made it harder for many crypto businesses to allow trading without verification. In February, Localbitcoins notified customers that changes were coming due to the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) that was enforced by the European Union. Now, this week, the company based in Southern Finland says the FSA’s new exchange supervision mandate has made it impose even stricter AML/KYC guidelines.

The company’s blog post on March 25 details that Localbitcoins will soon be “supervised” by the country’s FSA. The blog post adds that the Virtual Currency Service Providers (VCSP) Act will provide legal status for cryptocurrencies. “[The VCSP Act] should improve significantly Bitcoin’s standing as a viable and legit financial network,” Localbitcoins announcement notes. The trading platform’s post also explains that the team has launched a new registration process and users will still be able to begin trading the day they sign up. The new system administered will inhibit the creation of phony accounts as well.

Other Finland Cryptocurrency Operators Are Also Experiencing Regulatory Pressures

The news follows the harsh regulations and banking issues Finland cryptocurrency operators have been facing in recent times. The exchange and crypto wallet provider Prasos Oy told the media that Finnish banks will not cooperate with cryptocurrency providers. Henry Brade, Prasos CEO, explained at the time that the company’s operations could be frozen on a whim. “The risk is that we’ll see our last bank account closed before we can get the next one opened — That would freeze our business,” Brade revealed. Moreover, due to the strict regulations, even Finnish law enforcement officials were uneasy about storing 2,000 BTC seized in a criminal forfeiture case. The country’s new treasury guidelines detailed that officials cannot store the seized coins on an exchange and must use cold storage.

Localbitcoins statements this Monday explained that the robust identity verification process was actually “requested by many users.” According to the Localbitcoins founders, there will be four individual tiers for trading certain amounts of BTC volume. Corporate accounts will have to submit a more specialized verification method. Besides the latest requirements, the company has also revealed that “more details on each account level and verification requirements will be announced soon.”

The strict KYC guidelines enforced by Localbitcoins leaves BTC traders very few options for private and verification-free trading besides decentralized trading platforms like Bisq, Barterdex, and Openbazaar. However, liquidity on these particular decentralized applications is still extremely slim in comparison to their centralized counterparts.

A Reddit user posted the news on Saturday, saying that, while Twitch had allowed users to pay in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) through blockchain payments processor Bitpay, the option has been removed in the last couple of weeks “for all countries.”

A tweet from Twitch dating from last January does indicate that bitcoin at least was one of the accepted payment options, among other methods including Amazon Pay and Apple Pay:

Its terms and conditions currently state that the firm accepts “major credit cards, certain debit cards, PayPal, various payment methods through Xsolla and/or such other payment methods we may make available to you from time-to-time through our site, as forms of payment.”

Another Redditor said they had sometimes used BCH as a payment option for subscriptions, but with Twitch removing the option, they have canceled all subscriptions and notified the firm.

While cryptocurrencies have been widely touted as having a strong potential role in online payments, issues such as price volatility have sometimes frustrated the best intentions of merchants attempting to offer the option.

Microsoft, for example, suspended bitcoin payments on its store last January, citing “instability.” They were later reinstated, however.

Online gaming platform Steam also dropped its bitcoin payments feature in late 2017, citing chronic problems with the cryptocurrency’s high transaction fees and volatile price. It’s worth noting that the average fee for a bitcoin transaction has dropped significantly since the highs seen in 2017-2018.

Rakuten also confirmed the news in a separate statement.

Rakuten Wallet is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rakuten and replaces an exchange called Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc. that it acquired for $2.4 million last August.

The firm rebranded the exchange offering to Rakuten Wallet on March 1. In its announcement, Rakuten also said it is ceasing the older service at the end of this month and that users can sign up for the new Rakuten Wallet service from April.

The firm also said Everybody’s Bitcoin had been operating as a “deemed” cryptocurrency exchange provider since its launch in March 2017, having applied for a license at the time. The firm received a business improvement order from the Kanto bureau last spring, and has “officially restructured” its management system and upgraded internal systems in order to receive the license for the rebooted entity.

Bitmain’s application lapsed on Tuesday, six months after it was filed, the Hong Kong stock exchange’s website showed.

“We do recognize that despite the huge potential of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, it remains a relatively young industry which is proving its value,” the company said on its website. “We will restart the listing application work at an appropriate time in the future.”

Sources had previously told Reuters the company was aiming to raise at least $3 billion in its IPO.

Bitmain designs different microchips specialized for mining cryptocurrencies and for artificial intelligence applications, as well as manufacturing cryptocurrency and AI hardware, and managing crypto mining farms.

Bitmain also named Haichao Wang as CEO of the company while Micree Zhan and Jihan Wu, the co-founders of Bitmain, will continue to be directors.

In the post, Messari said that the aforementioned exchanges reported “significant and legitimate trading volumes via their APIs [application programming interface].” The company further revealed that in the coming months it will add other exchanges, adding clean book data to their data feeds.

Messari’s attention to “significant and legitimate” volumes follows a report from major cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management, which stated that 95 percent of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature.

“Under the hood the exchanges that report the highest volumes are unrecognizable. The vast majority of this reported volume is fake and/or non-economic wash trading,” the report read.

A separate report from The Tie came to similar conclusions, finding that nearly 90 percent of cryptocurrency exchanges’ reported trade volumes may be incorrect. The Tie said that 87 percent of the analyzed trading platforms’ reported trading volume was potentially suspicious.

Following Bitwise’s report, cryptocurrency market data resource CoinMarketCap (CMC) promised to recalculate how it ranks member exchanges. CMC executives wrote on Twitter:",

Money can be confusing. Nevermind the mathematics of personal finance, the very concept that paper, metal and digital money have specific value agreed upon in society is complicated. So, it's no surprise then that one digital type of money called cryptocurrency (from the Greek word ""crypto,"" meaning ""hidden"" or ""secret,"") can be even more difficult to wrap your head around.

Cryptocurrencies have roots at the fringes of society. They've infamously been sought as ransom payment or used to make illegal purchases because transactions aren't traceable by conventional means.

Now, cryptocurrencies are more mainstream than ever before. Sky-high values and astonishing price drops have attracted media attention and speculative investors. In February 2019, financial giant JPMorgan Chase issued its own cryptocurrency — a first among traditional financial institutions.

Cryptocurrencies are ""non-governmental digital assets that are widely tradeable,"" said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University in Washington D.C., who studies financial technology. Since Bitcoin — perhaps the best known type of cryptocurrency — was first suggested in 2008, many variations have emerged. There are now thousands of cryptocurrencies.

Put it on the blockchain

Many cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology. The idea behind blockchain is to keep a ""distributed ledger,"" sort of like a database of information that multiple parties have independent access to and must agree upon to make any changes. No one user is able to alter information on a blockchain ledger without permission from everyone else involved in a transaction, and a clear record of their actions. This means that a blockchain could prevent hacking attempts that rewrite ledgers or transfer funds without a log of changes.

Blockchain has been hyped as a security revolution, but in some ways it simply shifts the vulnerabilities of sensitive information. For example, a customer might not trust that their bank can keep their account balance protected, but if the customer loses their ATM card or online passwords, the bank will allow the customer to regain access to their money. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency that incorporates a blockchain puts more responsibility of security on the customer, so that a stolen or lost password could mean losing access to their funds forever.

Still, blockchain offers the possibility of doing familiar transactions more efficiently. ""The underlying technology is very useful,"" Angel said.

Types of cryptocurrencies

Not all cryptocurrencies are intended to be used in the same way as traditional currencies. There are three main categories of cryptocurrency, according to Angel:

Utility tokens can be redeemed for services (or ""utilities""), for example, on a network run by Ethereum, an open-source computing platform and operating system that has its own cryptocurrency. These services could be anything from online games and gambling, to marriage licenses.

Right now, one key offering from utility tokens is facilitating something called a smart contract. These are agreements in computer code that use a blockchain to automate the normal time-consuming communication between multiple parties. The utility tokens work like arcade tokens that can be used for a variety of games, so long as they're in the same arcade. That is, a variety of services may be provided by the same company that issues the utility token.

Smart contracts can also be used independently of cryptocurrencies. For example, in the state of Ohio, legislation was introduced to allow the use of smart contracts to register a car title. A smart contract could automatically coordinate agreements between a buyer, a car dealership, a bank and an insurance company.

These types of contracts could streamline everyday transactions, but we might not even notice when they've been introduced. ""It's probably going to be invisible to you in a lot of ways,"" Angel said, because a smart contract could replace much of the administrative work that goes on behind the scenes, while keeping roughly the same terms in place.

There are also payment tokens, like Bitcoin, which most closely resemble familiar forms of money, and can be exchanged for goods with anyone who will accept them as payment. Bitcoin is now accepted at some major online stores, such as the tech retailer Newegg, but it's far from being universally accepted. ""I don't think any of us are going to walk into a fast food restaurant any time soon and buy a burger with Bitcoin,"" Angel said.

And then there are security tokens. Rather than conferring some tangible utility, these tokens are used to certify ownership of something, similar to owning stock in a company. The classification of any cryptocurrency, which may be disputed, makes a difference in how it will be regulated. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declared its intent to treat most cryptocurrencies similarly to public stock, particularly in instances where the coin isn't exchanged for goods or services, but serves as a financial interest in an enterprise.

So, is cryptocurrency worth it?

An enormous amount of electricity use is built into the design of cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. Combined with its popularity, this has led to scrutiny of Bitcoin's energy consumption.

Rather than have a centralized set of computers that process transactions, users handle the daily operations of the Bitcoin economy. That involves user-owned computers running software that helps perform blockchain transactions. To incentivize users, the software also attempts to solve a mathematical puzzle through brute force — by guessing and checking one solution after another. When a solution is found, the lucky user is rewarded with Bitcoin. These users are called miners, and the process of running energy-consuming computers to earn coins is called mining. Although not all bitcoin users need to mine for Bitcoin, mining is essential to Bitcoin transactions.

It's been estimated that Bitcoin miners globally use electricity on the scale of entire countries like Ireland or Austria. ""The environmental impact of Bitcoin in its current form is just totally unacceptable,"" Angel said. [Top 10 Emerging Environmental Technologies]

Not only is the environmental impact concerning, but cryptocurrencies are also ""very volatile, [and] there are a lot of scams out there,"" Angel said. ""No one knows what they're really worth.""

With so much uncertainty swirling around cryptocurrencies, even the ones whose creators seem to have good intentions, what's a potential investor to do?

""I'd say the average person should just say no,"" Angel said.

“Despite lower prices since early 2018, our ratings model gives us hard evidence that a critical segment of the cryptocurrency industry has enjoyed remarkable growth in user transaction volume, network capacity, and network security. Equally important is our finding that these improvements are often powered by an evolution in the underlying technology,” says Weiss Ratings founder, Martin D. Weiss. “Therefore, for those willing to take the risk, the best time to invest could be very near.”

The Weiss Crypto Ratings are based on two separate grades — a tech/adoption grade for long-term investors and a risk/reward grade based on short-term factors. Focusing strictly on the former, Weiss finds that:

XRP, managed by Ripple, is best positioned to compete with SWIFT, the global network for interbank money transfers. Tech/Adoption Grade: A EOS is currently the leading cryptocurrency challenging Ethereum to become the backbone of the new internet. Tech/Adoption Grade: A Bitcoin, upgraded with the roll-out of its Lightning Network, is the best positioned to become a popular store of value for savers and investors. Tech/Adoption Grade: A Ethereum is the most widely used smart-contract platform, but currently faces difficulties with scaling. Tech/Adoption grade: A- Cardano aims to provide the most advanced smart contract capabilities, monetary policy and governance. Tech/Adoption Grade: B+

Also making the top 10 list for technology and adoption are Steem, NEO, Stellar, Zcash, and BitShares.

Weiss warns, however, that investors must not ignore the risk of loss, which remains far higher in crypto markets than virtually any other asset class. Thus, the overall Weiss Crypto Ratings, which include risk and reward factors, are not nearly as high. Only four — EOS, Ripple, Bitcoin and Binance — merit an overall rating of B-, and no coins get an A.

Weiss Crypto Ratings issues adoption/technology grades — along with the overall ratings — on over 120 cryptocurrencies. All the Weiss Crypto Ratings are now accessible online in real time to consumers, investors, and businesses looking to make informed decisions and avoid the cryptocurrency hype.

The report, co-written by Martin Weiss and chief cryptocurrency analyst, Juan Villaverde, identified five ongoing trends:

An important segment of the cryptocurrency industry is enjoying remarkable growth in the volume of user transactions, a key aspect of adoption. Improving adoption is largely powered by improving technology. The way cryptocurrencies are secured is changing quite rapidly. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) coins are on the rise, while Proof-of-Work (PoW) coins are losing market share. Some cryptocurrencies are moving beyond blockchain entirely. Killer dApps (Decentralized Applications) will play the biggest role in determining the future winners. Examples include: Decentralized, crypto-based social media, peer-to-peer lending and fair and secure elections

Weiss Crypto Ratings are updated on a weekly basis, including in-depth details on each coin’s adoption, technology, risk, and reward. In addition, the new Weiss Crypto Ratings website provides the world’s only crypto price indexes based on ratings.

FILE PHOTO: Logos of Monex Group Inc and Coincheck are seen before their joint news conference in Tokyo, Japan April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo

In July he became chief compliance officer at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, taking a leap into the more lightly regulated world of digital assets.

“It’s not for the faint of heart,” Horowitz said of the move from compliance on Wall Street to a cryptocurrency startup. “You need to have a flexible risk needle. The old school attitude of compliance being Doctor No really doesn’t translate well to this industry.”

Horowitz is one of several senior compliance officers hired by cryptocurrency firms over the past year in a recruitment spree aimed at helping them cope with increased regulatory scrutiny and becoming more palatable to mainstream investors.

The companies are especially keen to poach executives like Horowitz who have spent years in the legal and compliance divisions of large banks and law firms. But convincing them is not easy, say headhunters and recent hires.

They tend to be risk averse and could be put off by the industry’s libertarian founding ethos which can mean hostility toward government regulators.

Digital currency trading has also faced a year-long slump in volumes, making it harder for firms to attract candidates with promises of crypto riches.

Annual salaries for senior positions in London are around 120,000 pounds ($158,000) or more and in the United States around $300,000 or higher for larger companies, recruiters said.

As these salaries are in line with the mainstream financial industry, recruiters pitch the chance to work in a fast-moving and emerging industry.

“The best chief compliance officers have successfully mitigated risk for a living, and they tend to be relatively risk-averse when thinking about their careers,” said Scott Fletcher, a founder at fintech C-suite recruitment firm Intersection Growth Partners.

“To find a person who has the skill set and is also willing to take the risk to join a cryptocurrency firm, it’s tough.”

Carrying out checks on new clients, fielding requests for information from law enforcement, and figuring out what laws may apply to new financial assets - often across jurisdictions - are among the jobs that can be more challenging in a crypto firm.

“On-boarding a new client you need to undertake careful due diligence,” said Charles Beach of Lendingblock, a London-based securities lending platform for cryptocurrencies. “But you might not obtain the same level of assurance from a firm in the still very new crypto industry as you would from a mainstream financial firm.”

He previously worked in senior risk positions at trading firm IG Group, UBS and PwC.

HACKING SCANDALS

The crypto industry has been peppered by scandals including hacks, technology failings and alleged use of virtual coins for money laundering and on illegal online marketplaces.

In September the New York Attorney General’s Office said several cryptocurrency exchanges faced conflicts of interest, were vulnerable to market manipulation and put customer funds at risk.

The same month, British lawmakers said the cryptocurrency market resembled “the Wild West” and should take steps to protect consumers and make it less vulnerable to hacking.

Some cryptocurrency industry bodies, such as Britain’s CryptoUK, have welcomed calls for regulation, urging a balance between rules to shield consumers and nurturing innovation. Others, like Global Digital Finance, have looked to establish industry-wide international standards.

Still, major lapses continue to happen.

In January about $135 million in cryptocurrencies were frozen in the user accounts of Canadian exchange Quadriga after its founder, the only person with the password, died suddenly.

In an affidavit filed on Quadriga’s behalf, the founder’s widow said she did not have the password to a “cold wallet” that held the cryptocurrencies on the founder’s computer.

A year earlier hackers stole cryptocurrency worth $530 million from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck, prompting an industry-wide crackdown by Japan’s financial watchdog.

Coincheck eventually repaid affected investors some 46 billion yen ($413 million) with its own funds, and was bought by online brokerage Monex Group Inc last April.

“MAJOR LEAGUE TO LITTLE LEAGUE”

As regulators consider stricter new rules for exchanges or ramp up enforcement of existing ones, demand for experienced compliance professionals has grown.

“In the last 12 months we have seen somewhere near a 230 percent increase in volumes of compliance-related jobs,” said Zeth Couceiro, the founder of Plexus, a London-based recruitment firm whose specialties include cryptocurrencies.

Exchanges are also looking for employees who can help them adopt standards to appeal to more mainstream investors such as pension funds and asset managers. They have largely stayed clear of crypto, in part because of concerns about security breaches and a perception of lax internal controls.

“The people that can do that are the ones that have dealt with regulation for highly regulated institutions,” said Josh Goodbody, who was hired as general counsel for global sales and institutional business at Singapore-based exchange Huobi in June. Goodbody’s experience includes roles at State Street Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Some executives who have made the switch say the industry’s reputation still gives them pause.

A chief compliance officer at a major Japanese exchange said founders of cryptocurrency companies often lack the experience and rigor needed to run a financial company.

“Every day I experience the difference,” the person said. “It’s huge – it’s like going from major league baseball to little league.”",2019-03-28 06:06:14+00:00,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-regains-4k-short-squeeze/,"News Bitcoin Price Regains $4K But Bears Call It Low Volume ‘Short Squeeze’

Bitcoin price bulls may already be seeing the answer to their prayers as markets gained upward momentum March 27, taking Bitcoin above $4000.

$4K Of False Hope?

Data from CoinMarketCap confirmed Wednesday’s price trend, which occurred as analysts warned of the need for BTC/USD to close the month above $3800 to avoid bigger losses.

At press time, the pair was trading around $4070 on some major exchanges, corresponding to daily gains of 2.9 percent.

The uptick takes BTC above territory which had proven stubborn to crack in recent days after it lost its previous footing above $4000 March 25.

The downturn had given rise to warnings that further dips were likely, part of an overall bearish near-term scenario for Bitcoin which, some say, could take BTC/USD as low as $1000.

That remains real, one analyst noted Wednesday, examining the impetus behind the action around $4000.

“…Short squeezes are the reasons we see these multimillion dollar market buys pumping price,” a commentary runs. “If theres (sic) no follow through or we lose below 4k today, [the] reversal is real.”

Majority of today's pump has been low volume buying, but when looking at OI it is decreasing on each pump..meaning short squeezes are the reasons we see these multimillion dollar market buys pumping price. If theres no follow through or we lose below 4k today, reversal is real. pic.twitter.com/5s27XDwhUh — Derivative Degen (@DerivativeDegen) March 27, 2019

Major altcoin markets meanwhile fluctuated around Bitcoin’s activity, with Ethereum marking daily growth of 3.6 percent, Litecoin 4.5 percent, and EOS 12.3 percent.

No Let-Up For Long-Term Bulls

Beyond the short term, however, industry opinion on Bitcoin specifically remains buoyant. Adding to the list of bulls this week, venture capital firm Pantera Capital highlighted next’s year block reward halving event as a date to watch for holders.

The company noted the impact of previous halving events on price, with upward moves coming roughly a year prior to the halving itself.

This, it says, suggests the next U-turn should happen in June this year, prior to the halving in May 2020.

“We have seen a couple of these cycles where the tide begins to shift roughly a year in advance of these dates. Inflection points occurred 376 and 320 days prior to the 2012 and 2016 ‘halvings’, respectively,” a blog post reads.

Taking their average of 348 days could indicate a bottom on June 10, 2019. The vertical lines below indicate block reward halving dates and the circles represent past and possible future inflection points.

Pantera was not alone. As Bitcoinist reported, market analyst PlanB this week shared similar forecasts, with a prediction model leveraging stock-to-flow (SF) ratio giving a post-halving price of $55,000 per bitcoin some time in 2020-2021.

Such a figure would be handy for the industry’s increasingly-prominent advocates publicly staking their belief in a giant Bitcoin price becoming reality within a matter of years.

Beyond John McAfee’s infamous $1 million bet with himself, investor Tim Draper this week entered the fray, reportedly wagering on the Bitcoin price versus the national currency of Argentina – with the country’s president.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York announced Tuesday that it has unsealed a nine-count indictment charging Patrick McDonnell, also known as “Jason Flack,” with wire fraud and has arrested him.

Between November 2014 and January 2018, McDonnell allegedly represented himself as an experienced cryptocurrency trader, promising customers that he would provide them with trading advice, as well as buy and trade cryptocurrency on their behalf. McDonnell is said to have used his Staten Island-based company, CabbageTech Crop., also known as Coin Drop Markets, to solicit investments through social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.

However, neither McDonnell nor CabbageTech provided any investment services, according to the indictment. Instead, he sent investors “false” balance statements indicating that their investments were profitable, and “stole their money for his personal use.” When customers requested refunds, McDonnell allegedly first made excuses for delays in repayment and later stopped responding at all.

In total, McDonnell defrauded at least 10 victims of at least $194,000 in cash, 4.41 bitcoin (worth $17,500 at press time), 206 litecoin ($12,304), 620 ethereum classic ($2,914) and 1,342,634 verge ($9,965), according to the indictment.

“The defendant’s fraud ends now, he will be held responsible for his criminal conduct,” said Richard P. Donoghue, attorney for the Eastern District of New York. If proven guilty and convicted, McDonnell faces a jail term of a maximum 20 years.

McDonnell was previously sued by the U.S. derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in January 2018 for absconding with customers’ crypto assets.

Later in July, the CFTC wrapped up the case against McDonnell and was seeking a permanent injunction against him. McDonnell at the time gave up the fight saying he did not have the resources or the ability to continue contesting the charges brought against him.

“For the sake of pure minute-to-minute survival, I must continue to be removed from proceeding,” he said.

In the same case, the presiding district judge notably backed the CFTC in defining cryptocurrencies as commodities. At issue was whether the commission had the authority to regulate cryptocurrency as a commodity in the absence of federal level rules, and whether the law permitted the CFTC to exercise its jurisdiction in the matter.

Speaking at a taping of Laura Shin’s Unchained podcast at NYU’s Stern School of Business on March 26, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s “Crypto Mom”—a nickname she picked up after dissenting from the commission’s June 2018 decision not to approve a cryptocurrency exchange traded fund (ETF)—expressed a belief that her agency should be focused on protecting securities investors from fraud, not hindering speculation.

“At the SEC, we often think if we don’t have a rule in place, people are just going to buy stuff and they’re not going to even ask for any information. And that’s pretty ridiculous,” she said. “Yes, there’s a group of people who are willing to give their money on a hope and a dream and a little title called ‘crypto’ and nothing more. But I think, especially as the space is maturing, people are saying, ‘Wait a minute, I invested money in this project and now I have nothing. So, if I’m going to invest in another project, I’m going to ask a bunch of questions.’ And I think that’s a very healthy attitude to cultivate in people.”

The basic problem securities laws are trying to solve, she said, is making sure that a promoter trying to raise money is providing complete and accurate information that allows investors to make informed decisions.

“We’ve got to remember that there is really a natural inclination on the part of people to seek out information when they need it,” said Peirce, adding that there was plenty of information available in the cryptocurrency space.

“It’s a brutal space, where people are willing to rip each other to shreds, to say that each other’s projects are terrible,” online and on social media, she said. “Someone will say, ‘this project’s a complete fraud.’”

And sometimes it is, she added, pointing to the agency’s history of enforcement actions targeting initial coin offerings that qualified as securities offerings.

While a number focused on ICOs that did not register as securities, there have been examples of “outright fraud,” she said, “where people are taking advantage of the fact that crypto is really trendy. So, they’re throwing up white papers that sometimes are stolen from someone else, sometimes are completely not consistent with the underlying code, and they’re just running off with the money to a nice sunny location. And that’s the last we hear of them. We’re going to go after that kind of fraud, whether it’s labeled crypto or something else.”

The bottom line, she said, is that “people are out there, and they’re talking about this stuff, and I think that’s a really healthy way to get information out. Yes, the reason for the SEC’s existence is to get good disclosure out there to investors. And I think that’s a really important role. But I also don’t kid myself that absent our involvement, it won’t happen at all.”

Regulating a bridge too far

Regulatory overreach is a theme Peirce returned to several times. One of those came up around the question of when a cryptocurrency can go from a security at its ICO but become sufficiently decentralized that it becomes a non-security utility token—like Ethereum, although she wouldn’t address specific examples.

The Supreme Court’s Howey test gives some guidance, she said. Among the relevant factors are if there a broad group contributing to running the network, and if promoters are not maintaining a formal secondary market, she noted.

“I might not come to the same conclusion as some of my colleagues might, because I think often, you’re trying to look at what was in the purchaser’s head when she bought a token,” Peirce said. “Was she thinking, I’m going to make lots of money? Or was she thinking, I’m going to have a functional utility token? That’s a really strange road to go down because there are lots of products that you might buy thinking, ‘I’m going to be able to sell this for a lot of money somewhere down the line,’ but that doesn’t necessarily make it a security.”

She added, “If we’re candid about this, this is an area where we have to be careful. If we go crazy, our jurisdiction could expand to include almost anything. I mean, [companies] advertise watches. They show a picture of the father and the son and say, you buy this watch and this is your legacy for your child. I’ve even seen people say some of the best investments they’ve made are things like watches. If that’s the case, do we really want to walk down that road? I don’t. I’ve got enough to do on the security side.”

Another example came when discussing decentralized exchanges, which allow peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trades without going through a central service that holds and moves the coins for the two parties.

“I do think that we’re going to confront a very difficult situation when you’ve got a truly decentralized exchange where someone’s written some code and that’s being used to do exchanges,” Peirce said. “I don’t want someone who’s writing code to have to worry that that she’s going to get blamed down the road for what someone else did with her code. That’s an area that I’m particularly concerned about. We don’t want to outlaw writing code.”

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and Unchained’s Laura Shin at New York University, Tuesday, March 26, 2019 (photo by Lawrence Lewitinn for Modern Consensus).

Is regulation kneecapping the U.S. crypto industry?

Peirce said one of her goals when she first came to the SEC is to improve the agency’s outlook towards innovation broadly, and cryptocurrency is a natural area to focus on in this regard.

“I think that I can play a role in looking at ways that we can open the doors to make it easier for people to do what they’re trying to do, compliant with our securities laws,” she noted. “I’ve picked on the SEC because that’s where I can have an influence, but a lot of government agencies are not good innovation. They tend to be quite conservative because it’s safer. I think sometimes we have to take risks and that might not always work out well. That’s where I’m a little bit more willing to say, ‘We’ll let you do this, but if you get hurt, the onus is on you. You’ve chosen to take this risk, so we’re not going to protect you if you get hurt.’”

One fact that bears this out, Peirce said, is that there is a lot of innovation going on in Asia in terms of cryptocurrency regulation. “Are we missing out on something,” she asked. “Is there something that we could be doing differently so that some of that innovation would be happening here in the U.S. instead?”

That basic idea is part of the reason she opposed the decision to disapprove the proposal by the BATS BZX Exchange to list an ETF, Peirce said.

“I was pretty uncomfortable with the rationale that was guiding the decision,” she said, adding that in her opinion it was essentially the SEC’s discomfort with the underlying markets. That is a bad rationale, she argued, noting that there are a lot of other markets that are messy as well.

And while her fellow commissioners would disagree, Peirce said, “I did think there was a whiff of merit regulation in this decision, which was essentially us saying we don’t think this product would be good for investors. I don’t know whether that particular product or another exchange traded product based on cryptocurrency would be good for investors, but I think that investors can make that decision better than I can.”

Which isn’t to say that she doesn’t acknowledge the industry’s ongoing problems. She pointed to the recent report by Bitwise suggesting that 95 percent of the trading volume reported by cryptocurrency exchanges is faked, But she also called it a prime example of the industry proactively addressing SEC regulators’ concerns.

“If you really look at the data they present, they say there is this stuff going on and we’ve identified [it],” Peirce said. “But there’s this other piece of the market where we see a really effective well-functioning market.”

The pornography definition of crypto securities

One of the SEC’s main failings when it comes to the cryptocurrency market is that it still has not been able to provide would-be coin issuers or cryptocurrency exchanges with clear guidelines on what is a security, or what they need to do to comply with the regulations.

Peirce has been among the agency’s highest-profile critics in this regard, pushing for clear guidance, which has taken longer to materialize than many in the industry had hoped.

Without that guidance, crypto exchange operators and promoters are essentially left with the cryptocurrency version of US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart’s famous line about the definition of obscene and pornographic materials: “I know it when I see it.”

Which left Peirce to repeat advice she has given several times before when asked what she would do if she was running a cryptocurrency exchange. “I recommend for everyone who’s involved in this space and has a question in the back of his mind about whether or not there’s an issue with the securities law, come talk to us,” she said. “Again, the sooner you come in the better. It’s better if you come in before you start doing things, but come talk to us and work through the issues with us.”

That is a lot better, she added, than having the SEC come to you.

For one thing, the agency is not done with its enforcement actions, Peirce said, raising a chuckle by noting that while the SEC doesn’t necessarily have the resources to go after every violation, “It’s not like we’re doing a Noah’s Ark approach, where we’re only doing two of a particular kind of case.”

That said, she did add that by this point, exchange operators should have an idea if a product trading on their platform is a security or not. “I think it’s really important to do the due diligence on that,” she said. “You do have a very prescriptive set of rules around exchanges that trade securities, so you’ve got to be aware that you could trip those and that you could end up in a not a good place.”

The $140 mark serves as next big hurdle in the path for Ethereum which needs to scale $150 handle to prepare for next leg of positive price action targetting $200 handle. Unless resistance levels mentioned above are breached, Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to see repeated dead cat bounce scenarios.

Although BTC has continued to climb, it has still failed to decisively break above $4,100, which has proven to be a strong level of resistance so far.

Now, one analyst believes that Bitcoin is nearing a battle zone that will likely lead to some major volatility in the near-future.

Bitcoin (BTC) Continues Climbing, but is Nearing Key Resistance Level

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up 0.5% at its current price of just under $4,090. This past Monday, Bitcoin faced a large amount of selling pressure that sent its price spiraling downwards to lows of $3,900, where it found support that propelled it back above $4,000 and towards its current price levels.

Charles Hayter, the co-founder of CryptoCompare, spoke to MarketWatch about BTC’s recent price action, noting that large investors are likely accumulating the cryptocurrency at these current price levels.

“We are still in this channel we’ve been in the past couple of months and those who were getting out have and now some long-term investors are probably looking to accumulate… Furthermore, we are still seeing a lot of solid infrastructure being built and people are realizing more and more people are adopting the technology,” Hayter explained.

Bitcoin’s ability to hold well above its 2018 lows of $3,200 over the past several months has been an overwhelmingly positive revelation for the cryptocurrency, as it signals that this price level is likely to be a long-term support level, and possibly a bottom.

Analyst: Bitcoin Nearing a Battle Zone

Because Bitcoin is nearing an established level of resistance around $4,100, and an even stronger level of resistance around $4,200 to $4,300 that was formed in late-February, it is likely that BTC’s current levels of relative stability will be fleeting.

David Puell, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this upcoming volatility, noting in a chart that Bitcoin is currently caught in an ascending channel that is pointing it towards the aforementioned resistance levels and towards its 200-day moving average (MA), which will likely result in large volatility.

“$BTC: This battle is going to be a fun one to watch,” he concisely noted while referencing a chart with his notes on it.

As the crypto markets begin to enter the end of the week, it is likely that analysts will gain a better understanding of whether or not BTC is ready to break above the strong resistance levels that lay ahead of it, or if it needs to dip lower before incurring more buying pressure.

It could be the future for all digital document storage as it was designed to be a secure digital ledger that can be added to, but not altered. Blockchain should survive even if some cryptocurrencies fail.

One advantage of Bitcoin is, it is said to have a limited supply as there are only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined in total. Bitcoin transactions work on the blockchain – a decentralized ledger to record all transactions. Bitcoin mining is where decentralized hard drives process all the global Bitcoin transactions, and in return they are paid in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been around for ten years (since 2009), but it is still considered a birthing technology that is prone to serious price swings thanks to market fluctuations and perhaps manipulation. In late 2017, Bitcoin reached a high of nearly $20,000 and left many early crypto investors feeling like they had made the right choice. The news surrounding the currency’s rise caused a mad rush to all things crypto. Then in 2019 the crypto space crashed back to earth, with Bitcoin now trading at US$4,076 a coin. However for those that got in right at the beginning they are still up an amazing 2,913%.

Cryptocurrencies have potential to be the new digital money. Bitcoin, Ether (Ethereum), Litecoin and a few thousand other “crypto” currencies have become very popular, despite some huge volatility.

Gold is also very limited in its supply, as it is so rare, and expensive to find and mine. Also gold has many centuries of history of being a valuable metal, and a store of wealth. From the ancient Egyptians to the modern U.S. Treasury, there are few metals that have had such an influential role in human history as gold.

In 1792, the US Congress passed the Mint and Coinage Act. This Act established a fixed price of gold in terms of U.S. dollars. Gold and silver coins became legal tender in the United States. With gold now being a US legal tender many gold rushes occurred throughout the 1800s. Since a single gold nugget could make someone a millionaire, prospectors rushed to far flung corners of the planet in search of riches. Gold has been giving humans gold fever since the ancient Egyptians. There’s no single reason why gold has been seen as an exceptionally luxurious metal throughout all of human history other than its shiny and attracts the eye, and it is quite rare.

The talk is gold may rally in 2019 and outperform all asset classes, pushing the price towards $US1,500. Some also say the next cycle peak could reach $1,900 an ounce, maybe sometime next year.

Gold versus Cryptocurrency

Certainly in the past year gold has been the better bet, as gold has maintained its value while most cryptocurrencies (led by Bitcoin) have fallen heavily. And yes it is probably true that older investors like gold and the younger ones like cryptos. Gold has been around since ancient times and has credibility as an investment. Cryptocurrencies are very much new to the market and are a volatile asset, for now, that will one day find their place in the finance market. So probably a good idea to own both, just be careful to choose an established safe cryptocurrency.

Given current sentiment I think gold will do better than Bitcoin in 2019. But I could easily be wrong. I am happy to hear your views in the comments section below.

",2019-03-28 15:01:18+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/study-14-of-major-crypto-exchanges-are-licensed-by-regulators,"Only 14 percent of 216 global crypto exchanges were confirmed as being licensed by regulators, regulatory technology (regtech) startup Coinfirm found in its crypto exchange risk report released on March 27.

Coinfirm, а London-based regulatory tech firm for digital currencies and blockchain, studied 216 global cryptocurrency exchanges to outline the key risks that can be associated with each platform, as well as to assist monitors in developing necessary regulatory frameworks. The analyzed exchanges reportedly represent more than 90 percent of global crypto market activity.

In the study, Coinfirm evaluated the exchanges into seven categories of risk, including license and authorization, Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, sanctions, senior public figures, jurisdiction, and negative and adverse media.

The study found that 69 percent of exchanges do not have “complete and transparent” CDD and KYC procedures, while only 26 percent introduced AML procedures such as monitoring transactions or recruiting a money laundering officer.

Coinfirm also found that 40 percent of analyzed exchanges do not support fiat currencies and conduct exchanges only between cryptocurrencies. Of the remaining 60 percent that do provide fiat exchanges, only 23 percent had full KYC processes that supported both deposits and withdrawals for crypto and fiat currency transactions, the report notes.

In the report, Coinfirm provided the average composite risk performance of exchanges in specific jurisdictions, with the low-risk countries including countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, and others. Among the high-risk nations, Coinfirm listed Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Iran, a number of African countries, and others.

The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia were assessed as medium risk.

Binance exchange, the biggest crypto trading platform by daily trade volumes, was evaluated as a high-risk exchange due to a long lasting period of exposure to anonymous cryptos such as Monero (XMR) and ZCash (ZEC), the report reads. Coinfirm added that the exchange appeared to have been regularly changing jurisdictions, which infers potential regulatory arbitrage.

Recently, Binance partnered with risk management and compliance firm IdentityMind to address data security and compliance measures for Binance’s global operations by enabling IdentityMind’s KYC and AML compliance tools.

Earlier today, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that recent reports on fake trading volumes on CoinMarketCap are useful for the crypto industry.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-cz-fake-volume-reports-are-useful-for-crypto-industry-to-move-forward,"The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, said in an interview with Cointelegraph on March 27 that recent reports on fake trading volumes are useful for the crypto industry.

Zhao, known in the industry as CZ, said that the reports — most recently from Bitwise Asset Management and The Tie — on exchanges widely faking volumes will end up making the whole industry more transparent. He also stressed that the story has nothing to do with CoinMarketCap — one of the most popular crypto rankings websites:

“It's not so much Coinmarketcap’s fault, everyone tried to blame on them [sic]. But CoinMarketCap has a very simple reporting mechanism where every exchange reports their own data to them, and they just show it.”

CZ also noted that Binance would not argue with CoinMarketCap on Twitter, calling reported encouragement to do so from the community “kind of childish.” Instead, the Malta-based top exchange is reportedly working with CoinMarketCap’s team to solve this issue. CZ also proposed that potential penalties from CoinMarketCap, such as delisting an exchange that was caught faking volumes, could help to solve the problem.

CZ underscored that the company also plans to further encourage high transparency levels industry wide.

Cointelegraph spoke to CZ in the wake of new research from trading analytics platform The Tie, which gathered figures from 97 exchanges. The report stated that the vast majority of the crypto trade volumes claimed to come from users — some 87 percent, to be precise — may not in fact exist.

Commenting on the report to Cointelegraph in the same interview this week, The Tie’s co-founder Joshua Frank said that there’s an easy way to distinguish a legitimate transaction from a fake one. Usually, he explained, users would transfer no more that 1 Bitcoin (BTC) (about $4,000) or even less at a time, while transactions in the $20,000 range reported by some exchanges are unrealistic.

Even more recently, cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management released a similar report, but focused on Bitcoin trading only. The report, submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, stated that almost 95 percent of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature. Above all, Bitwise accused CoinMarketCap of listing this suspect data and thus generating a fundamentally mistaken impression of the true size of the BTC market.

According to Bitwise, Binance is one of the just ten crypto exchanges out of the 81 it analyzed that has “actual volume.”

Binance is currently the largest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trade volume on CoinMarketCap, seeing $1.1 billion in trades on the day to press time.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/110000-investors-in-ghana-lost-25-7-million-in-crypto-scams-and-hacks/,"Around 110,000 Ghanian investors lost a total of $25.71 million to crypto investment scams and hacks in 2018, the lawmakers noted.

Ama Pomaa Boateng, the member of parliament for Ghana’s Juaben town, initiated a dialogue against the crypto-led investment epidemic. The 43-year old public representative, while addressing the Ghana parliament, stressed on the need for sound crypto regulation, citing the 2018’s notorious Global Coin Community Scam that swindled 109,259 Ghanaians to the tune of GHC134m. The Scammers promised victims a monthly return of 27-percent for a year but later ran away with their crypto-based capital investments.

“There is the issue of lack of compliance due to the nature of cryptocurrency and crypto asset because the users are anonymous and it is extremely difficult to collect data on digital currency users,” Boateng said.

Crypto Traders are Illegal in Ghana

While Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering to introduce a cryptocurrency law, trading of such assets remains illegal in the country, clarified Dr. Mark Assibey Yeboah, the chairman of the finance committee. The parliamentarian considered the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies a threat to their financial system, adding that regulators would eventually gain a firm grip on the industry.

“This is a digital platform where money is transferred amongst the peers. It is not the cheque system where a central bank clears it,” Dr. Yeboah said.

The MPs in one voice cautioned the public against investing in or conducting cryptocurrency transactions. The warning was reminiscent of how SEC’s Deputy General Paul Abadio refused any legal help for the victims of Global Coin Community scam.

“When you choose to go there, you are on your own,” he had said, adding they were still doing “research and gathering information” on the matter. The Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) earlier had arrested two directors in connection with the scam. However, the agency later released them following their bail application approval.

Educating Public About Crypto

James Klutse Avedzi, the chairman of the public accounts committee, said that their public and government authorities were yet to learn about the nature of cryptocurrencies and how to deal with them. The proceeding delays in the Global Coin Community scam somewhat pointed to the fact that Ghana was without a crypto law all this time. And since the scammers siphoned off investors’ money in cryptocurrencies, there was a likelihood of them slipping through the legal cracks.

Avedzi suggested that the government should ask the Bank of Ghana to research cryptocurrencies. The lawmaker added that it would help the central bank draft new policies in the cryptocurrency space. Daniel Okyem Aboagye, another parliamentarian, supported the idea, stating that the government should educate the Ghanian population about cryptocurrencies.

“The discussion is good,” Aboagye said. “It tells the entire nation that lawmakers are concerned about the happenings in the cryptocurrency industry.”",2019-03-28 16:12:03+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/innisfil-property-tax-uber-ontario-bitcoin-crypto-1.5075961,"The Ontario town of Innisfil will soon begin accepting digital currencies as payment for its property taxes, starting with Bitcoin.

The town of 36,000 people is north of Toronto and south of Barrie, Ont.

Its council voted late Tuesday in favour of the one-year cryptocurrency pilot project, in partnership with a Toronto company.

Starting in April, Innisfil residents will be able to pay taxes with Bitcoin through a digital wallet operated by Coinberry Pay, which will convert the cryptocurrency to Canadian funds and transfer the payment to the town.

Mayor Lynn Dollin says Innisfil is signalling to the world that it's an innovative community that's ready for the future.

Innisfil also provides a tax-subsidized Uber ride-hailing service as an alternative to conventional public transit.

Other forms of cryptocurrency may follow, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple.

The town's experiment is being launched amid controversy about the risks of using cryptocurrency which, unlike conventional currency, isn't backed by any government or central bank.

Investigators have yet to determine what happened to about $190 million worth of cryptocurrency that has been missing or inaccessible since December, when a co-founder of QuadrigaCX trading platform died without revealing his password.

On Tuesday, the Ontario Securities Commission said it's part of Operation Cryptosweep — which includes more than 40 regulators in the United States and Canada.

According to the North American Securities Administrators Association, Operation Cryptosweep has resulted in 35 pending or completed enforcement actions since the beginning of March.

Last year, Toronto voted down a motion by Coun. Norm Kelly to look into whether residents of that city should be able to used cryptocurrency to pay bills such as property taxes, parking tickets and land transfer taxes.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/exchange-kucoin-enables-credit-card-purchases-of-crypto,"Singapore-based crypto exchange KuCoin has partnered with Israel-based payment processing company Simplex to let its users purchase crypto via credit card, an official announcement revealed on March 27.

The exchange has already added the service to its assets page, the announcement reports. Now users can purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHABC) and Litecoin (LTC) for both dollars and euros. The service is reportedly available in more than 100 countries.

As the release notes, Simplex — which also has offices in the United Kingdom, U.S. and Lithuania — has already provided its “fraud-free” payment processing services to other companies, such as Shapeshift, the Litecoin Foundation, Xapo and Changelly.

As Cointelegraph previously wrote, KuCoin closed a Series A funding round worth $20 million in late November 2018. The round was led by IDG Capital, Matrix Partners and Neo Global Capital. The exchange reported that the funds would be used to release KuCoin’s 2.0 platform.

Earlier this year, Malta-based top cryptocurrency exchange Binance also added support for credit card purchases. Later the firm introduced credit card purchases in its official wallet, Trust. In both cases, the company also partnered with Simplex to provide credit and debit card purchases of XRP, BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH.

Firstly, the firm’s recently appointed chief security officer, Nicholas Percoco, announced in a blog post on Tuesday that the exchange has launched compulsory two-factor authentication (2FA).

Kraken has had 2FA as an option for users since its launch in September 2013, but now they will be asked to enable the feature upon their next login, Percoco said, adding that the prompted options for 2FA are Google Authenticator and YubiKey currently.

Secondly, the exchange has formed Kraken Security Labs, aimed to improve the security of both its own products and the “entire cryptocurrency ecosystem” by performing “vulnerability” research on third-party products, such as hardware and software wallets.

Percoco said his vision for Kraken is to “expand upon the strong, industry leading security foundation,” and utilize advanced security products such as threat intelligence, behavior analytics and adversarial deception techniques, and incorporate them into the exchange’s present and future products.

The CSO further said that Kraken will keep developing with other client-facing security enhancements in the near future. The exchange’s product management team will provide “constant improvement into 2020 and beyond” through its security features roadmap.

“While this roadmap is not made public, you’ll be hearing about security enhancements and upgrades as they are released and made available to you,” Percoco said. “Like most features similar to 2FA, you’ll need to enable them to take advantage of the added security, so please be sure to take action when you’re prompted to.”

The town of Innisfil will begin accepting Bitcoin as payment for property taxes in April, local news outlet Simcoe. According to the report, Innisfil is the first municipality in the North American nation to offer citizens the option to pay in cryptocurrency.

“Once again, we are proud to be first in taking this bold step by offering this new, exciting payment option to our residents,” Innisfil Mayor Lynn Dollin said in a statement.

Indeed, this is not an outright integration of cryptocurrency payments yet, but a one-year trial period.

When residents log on to Innisfil’s website they will be presented with a new option to pay in Bitcoin. The report states that other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple could be added at a later date.

It should be noted that the municipality isn’t technically receiving payments in Bitcoin, though. The town is partnering with a third-party payment provider that converts cryptocurrency to fiat.

Though residents can pay their taxes in Bitcoin, the system will convert the funds to fiat and forward them to the town.

The main advantage appears to come if you normally pay taxes with a credit card which would be subject to a “convenience fee,” according to the Innisfil municipality website. Using Bitcoin, this fee is reduced by half, according to the payment provider.

That said, you could always pay taxes through your bank, directly in person or with a cheque – avoiding the fees altogether.

If the trial is successful, Innisfil could join Ohio as another municipality that accepts tax payments in cryptocurrency.

It will be interesting to see how many people take Innisfil up on this new payment option. Particularly when companies like Microsoft and Steam have lost interest in supporting Bitcoin as a payment option due to poor uptake.

Ever since Bitcoin’s massive price drop in December 2017, the cryptocurrency market has been stuck in a stress inducing bear market that’s created global layoffs, bankruptcies, investor withdrawals and mining companies going under. Three of the largest market cap coins, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, all have dropped more than 85% from their previous all-time highs.

A substantial bear market has put the bears, Hodler's and long-term cryptocurrency investors into hibernation, hoping and waiting for the next major bull rally to begin.

One iconic Bitcoin price analyst and early adopter, with a reputation for releasing highly accurate price predictions, has recently come back online with some very bullish price charts for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin – complete with very bold price targets and even exact dates on when to expect each coin’s price to achieve a full breakout.

Instagram user @theblockjesus (Martin Gerraux) has been missing from the cryptocurrency scene since November 20th 2017, almost exactly one month before Bitcoin took a complete nosedive and fell 22% in four days, which was the beginning of our current and long lasting bear market.

Gerraux was one of the earliest adopters and traders of Bitcoin starting in 2010, shortly after ending a 10 year career as a financial analyst with one of New York’s top firms.

It was on November 19 2017 when Martin Gerraux posted one of his pen highlighted Bitcoin charts that contained a dire warning of an impending drop in mid December 2017. At that time, not many people took notice. The bulls were running on pure adrenaline, buying Lambos with Bitcoin and no one really cared to listen to some guy posting a doom and gloom scenario about an upcoming Bitcoin crash.

What the crypto community didn’t realize at the time was - he was right. Like a modern-day crypto Nostradamus, he had predicted the December Bitcoin crash almost to the exact date - one month prior.

After being absent from the crypto scene for well over a year, Martin Gerraux is back and people are listening very seriously - as he is predicting that “the next bullrun is absolutely imminent in April” but its his Instagram posts that have the entire crypto world mesmerized. In his most recently posted charts, the trader (that many refer to as Block Jesus) has predicted the precise breakout dates for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.

Litecoin, he says, which has experienced a slightly bullish momentum over the past 2 weeks, is “pushing towards a major breakout” currently. For Litecoin, Gerraux has set a price target for $675, which would be a new all time high for the cryptocurrency.

On Martin’s Ethereum chart, he is very specific, posting a price breakout date of April 25, 2019 with a price target of $2200, which would create a new spectacular high for Vitalik Buterin’s smart contract enabled cryptocurrency.

Last but not least, with Bitcoin, the grand daddy and master of all cryptocurrencies, Martin Gerraux has set a “Blast-Off Moment” of April 13, 2019, which is only a few weeks away. His price target for this massive Bitcoin breakout? A new all-time high of $29,000.

Many viewing these price charts and extremely bold breakout predictions might be left wondering if the next bull run is truly coming, however, it’s very rare that the crypto community pays such close attention to one analyst, and it’s even more rare to have an analyst that predicted the Bitcoin crash of 2017, reappear online after 1 year of silence with price breakout predictions so highly specific.

This time around for Martin Gerraux, the crypto world is listening and paying very close attention.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentinas-dep-finance-minister-crypto-adoption-could-reduce-demand-for-us-dollar,"Huobi Group CEO Leon Li met with senior Argentinian finance officials this week to discuss the role of blockchain and crypto in the country’s economy, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on March 29.

In a meeting in Beijing, Argentina’s Deputy Minister of Finance, Felix Martin Soto, claimed that the government should address crypto and blockchain tech as a way to promote Argentina’s financial inclusion and reduce state costs.

Soto, who leads Argentina’s international financial relations, explained that half of the country’s population does not have bank accounts and operate cash transactions by converting their savings to United States dollars.

Soto stated that he believes that promoting crypto industry in the country will help to reduce its demand for USD, which will eventually contribute to stabilizing the local market and attracting global investment.

In a delegation meeting that also included Argentina’s Director-General of the Bilateral External Finance Bureau, Javier Matias Mana, the parties also discussed a potential expansion of Chinese exchange Huobi to Argentina. Soto elaborated:

“We would like to learn how to participate in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry from Huobi. [...] Through tokenization on Huobi’s platform, for example, Argentina’s plentiful agricultural, mineral and energy resources could be well financed by global investors.”

The finance official concluded that ""[w]ith Huobi's expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrency, Argentina can accelerate its pace to digital assets era.""

The news has followed a recent meeting between Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, and crypto investor and entrepreneur Tim Draper. The notorious crypto bull told the president that the legalization of Bitcoin (BTC) would improve the economic situation in the country. According to Draper, crypto and blockchain adoption in the country can disrupt major problems in Argentina's economy, including the devaluation of the Argentine peso and the associated brain drain.

Supreme Court Hearing Today

The Supreme Court of India was scheduled to hear the crypto case today, after it gave the government four weeks to produce a report on the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency during the last hearing on Feb. 25. However, according to Twitter account Crypto Kanoon, an Indian platform for blockchain and crypto regulatory news and analysis:

Supreme Court has adjourned the Crypto vs RBI matter on the request of government’s counsel. Matter fixed for final arguments in 2nd week of July on a non-miscellaneous (regular) day.

Update: According to the court order, the next hearing will be on July 23.

India’s cryptocurrency regulation is being drafted by an interministerial committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. During the last hearing, the government told the court that this committee was in its final stages of deliberations. The exact date of the next hearing will be in the court order which has yet to be released.

The RBI Ban Continues for Now

India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), issued a circular in April last year banning banks under its control from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect in July and banks in the country closed the accounts of crypto exchanges as well as of customers that showed transactions involving cryptocurrencies.

Jaideep Reddy, a lawyer with Nishith Desai Associates, told news.Bitcoin.com earlier this week that “One would hope the case on the RBI circular is decided soon since the industry has been in limbo for nearly a year now.” Reddy represents the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) in its writ petition against the RBI ban.

The banking restriction has forced Indian exchanges to improvise and change their business models. Some launched crypto-only trading while others launched escrowed peer-to-peer (P2P) services. A number of exchanges have reported a rise in demand for P2P trading.

Some companies shut down their Indian operations because of the banking restriction such as Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India. Another large crypto exchange, Unocoin, tried to bypass the ban by launching a cash kiosk. However, the exchange ran into trouble with law enforcement which mistook its kiosk for an ATM that violated the RBI ban and arrested two of the company’s founders.

Meanwhile, the Indian crypto community has come together on a social media campaign calling for positive regulation and an end to the banking ban.

Now, a number of market data websites have ramped up pressure on exchanges to provide accurate figures.

Fake It Till You Make It

Due to its dominance, Coinmarketcap exerts a significant pull over the cryptocurrency market, incentivizing exchanges to inflate their reported trading volume, in a bid to game the ratings system. CMC ranks exchanges by both reported and adjusted volume, in a bid to thwart the exchanges determined to fake it till they make it as legitimately active trading venues. Nevertheless, fake volume remains a huge problem. Some have disputed Bitwise’s claim that the true size of the cryptoconomy is just 1/20th of its reported total. It is evident, however, that the amount of cryptocurrency credited with changing hands on a daily basis has been significantly overstated.

A number of market data websites, led by Messari, are striving to share unvarnished figures that have not been inflated. That doing so will distinguish these data platforms from CMC in the process can’t hurt either. Messari’s Onchainfx dashboard now includes a column for “Real 10” 24-hour volume – the 10 exchanges singled out by Bitwise for their honest reporting.

‘They Could Fix This Problem Overnight If They Wanted’

Coinsbit is a fiat-crypto exchange that’s listed on market data websites including Coinmarketcap. A spokesperson for the platform explained to news.Bitcoin.com that it was incumbent upon each exchange to act ethically and to refrain from practices that might artificially inflate volume. “Sites like Coinmarketcap are reliant upon the accuracy of the data they’re fed via API from cryptocurrency exchanges,” noted the Coinsbit representative. “While CMC can take measures to omit or penalize platforms that have been found to be misreporting volume, the onus is on the exchanges themselves: they could fix this problem overnight if they wanted, but as it stands, there’s no economic incentive to do so.”

Mateusz Sroka of market data website Coinpaprika told news.Bitcoin.com that fake volume is a problem that has plagued the cryptocurrency industry for years, and that blatant market manipulation, including falsely reported volume, has been a deterrent to institutional adoption. “In the past 12 months, we’ve seen pressure placed on crypto exchanges to clean up their act, and also for market data sites to proactively penalize platforms that blatantly misreport their figures,” he said, adding:

It’s going to take a concerted effort to stamp out manipulation altogether, but there are already signs that exchanges are feeling the pressure to act more ethically, which will help to further legitimize the cryptocurrency sector in the eyes of the wider public.

These Coinmarketcap Alternatives Provide a Different Take on the Crypto Markets

For traders interested in obtaining more accurate trading figures, or accessing features that Coinmaketcap doesn’t offer, there is a number of alternatives to explore.

Messari: For “true” trading volume and more accurate figures pertaining to circulating supply of crypto asssets, Messari’s Onchainfx is the market leader.

Openmarketcap: This cryptocurrency data tracker uses prices and trading volumes from trusted exchanges only in calculating average prices and total volume.

Coinpaprika: For clear data on trading volumes, plus information on price differences between exchanges, Coinpaprika has got it locked down.

Bitcoin.com Markets: For legibility, Bitcoin.com’s crypto asset charts are clean and comprehensible, with a distinct and pleasing aesthetic. The portal also offers crypto charts paired with seven fiat currencies.

Blockmodo: For information on social chatter surrounding cryptocurrency projects, and how this may feed into market prices, Blockmodo is ideal.

Coinratecap: This CMC alternative has a number of useful features including a cryptocurrency price converter and links to almost 100 exchanges.

Coingecko: For listing crypto assets the moment they’re tradable, Coingecko is ahead of the pack.

Coincodex: For customized filters, including three-month and year-to-date changes, Coincodex is perfect. Like Coingecko, it’s also quick to list new digital assets and features a host of insightful data points.

First they came for our privacy. Then our data. Finally they took our memes. If the more hyperbolic headlines are to be believed, the EU’s ratification of the controversial Article 13 copyright law will have repercussions for purveyors of highly shareable online content. The reality is less draconian. Nevertheless, Article 13, coupled with last year’s GDPR laws, has ramifications for all tech companies, blockchain projects included.

Article 13 Passes But Memes Earn a Reprieve

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, described as “the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years,” received a mixed reaction upon its introduction last year. Within the cryptocurrency industry, the fallout was limited to a handful of projects that bowed out rather than accede to the incoming regulations. As hybrid blockchain company LTO Network noted, GDPR posed “an even greater challenge” to blockchain projects “due to the intrinsic characteristics of the technology, even causing some projects to shut down and go out of business.”

Now that the European Parliament has voted in Article 13, crypto businesses face yet another logistical challenge: how to remain compliant while operating public blockchain networks that are meant to be censorship-resistant, and thus impervious to copyright law. A handful of crypto companies, LTO Network among them, haven’t just adapted to new EU data laws – they’ve embraced them. The Dutch-based blockchain company provides GDPR compliant services to clients accessing public and private blockchains. This week it inked a deal with Signrequest, one of Europe’s biggest electronic signing parties to secure its documents on the LTO Network.

What Did the EU Meme by This?

Not everyone is enamored with the EU’s data directives. Digital liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation has described Article 13 as “a censorship machine that puts thousands of daily activities and millions of internet users at the mercy of algorithmic filters.” Opponents of the copyright law include Tim Berners Lee, who is overseeing a decentralized social app called Solid that will enable users to own and control their data. Content shared “for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody, and pastiche,” will be excluded from Article 13, so memes should be safe at least. That’s just as well seeing how Article 13 itself has inspired a plethora of memes.

But what about other types of copyright content that might be uploaded to crypto networks, in contravention of GDPR or Article 13? When the copyright infringement claims start flying in, the crypto community will be watching attentively to see which so-called blockchains censor content that was uploaded onchain, and which ones refuse because either they won’t or they can’t. Article 13 was conceived to clamp down on the theft of intellectual property. How strange if its primary benefit came to be as a litmus test on the decentralization of crypto networks.

What are your thoughts on Article 13? Let us know in the comments section below.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Japan is moving towards regulated crypto exchanges. The Japanese financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), has recently approved two entities to begin operations in April. Currently, only about 14 percent of the total 216 crypto exchanges around the world are licensed by regulators, according to the latest report by startup firm Coinfirm.

Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin is looking to create a cryptocurrency token backed by palladium that will improve the ease of transactions. The tokens will be traded through a Switzerland-based palladium fund. Similarly, blockchain-enabled diamond exchange Cedex will start operations by trading about 6,000 diamonds worth over $50 million. Another blockchain trust company Paxos wants to tokenize gold and expects to start operations this year.

Many cryptocurrency investors are first-timers who have no experience with other asset classes. To tap into this set of investors who want to own some equity exposure, decentralized financial contracts platform UMA has partnered with Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) MakerDAO to release USStocks, a token tied to the U.S. stock markets.

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are attempting to make a difference in the way traditional assets are traded. If successful, it will be a bullish move for the nascent asset class. The recovery in crypto markets continues. Let’s see which major coins look strong.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has continued its journey toward of the overhead resistance of $4,255. The bulls have been struggling to scale this level since last December, hence, this is a major hurdle to watch out for.

If the digital currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $4,255, it will complete a double bottom. This reversal pattern increases the probability of a new uptrend that has a minimum target objective of $5,273.91.

Both the moving averages are sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone. This shows that the buyers have the upper hand but the current up move lacks momentum.

Contrary to our bullish view, if the BTC/USD pair fails to ascend $4,255, it will remain stuck in the large range of $4,255–$3,236.09 for a few more weeks. After a sharp bear market, the bottoming formation is likely to take a long time. The longer the base, the stronger the eventual breakout from it will be.

However, if the pair breaks down of $3,236.09, it will sour sentiment and can result in a waterfall decline. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $3,500. We shall soon trail the stops higher.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to break out above the overhead resistance at $144.78. It has turned down from this level thrice in the past one month. Hence, this level assumes significance.

If the bulls push above the resistance at $144.78, the ETH/USD pair can quickly rally to $167.32. The pair might face a strong resistance at this level. Hence, we might tighten the stops when the price reaches $167.32.

On a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $167.32, the digital currency will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish set up has a target objective of $251.64.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price breaks below the uptrend line. The traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $125

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) continues to trade near the moving averages. Both the averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This points to a balance between the buyers and the sellers.

The balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if the XRP/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.33108. Just above this level is the resistance line of the descending channel. On rising above both these resistances, we expect the trend to change. The ensuing rally can reach $0.60 in the medium-term.

Conversely, if the bears sink the digital currency below $0.27795, it can plummet to the yearly low of $0.24508. We do not find any reliable buy setups at current levels; hence, we are not suggesting any trade in it.

EOS/USD

EOS has reached the critical overhead resistance of $4.4930 from where it had reversed direction on Feb. 24. Currently, the bulls are attempting to break out of the resistance. If successful, the digital currency can move up to $5.8370.

Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in command and a breakout is likely. Still, as the price has reached a critical level, we suggest traders trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $3.70. We shall raise the stops again in a couple of days.

Contrary to our expectation, if the EOS/USD pair again reverses direction, it can fall to $3.8723, which should act as a strong support. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, hence, this level assumes significance. The momentum will weaken if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has been consolidating near the highs for the past 13 days. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not booking profits yet because they anticipate higher levels. The digital currency will extend the recovery if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $61.9044. Following the breakout, a quick move to $69.2790 is probable.

The upsloping moving averages indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. However, the bearish negative divergence on the RSI can play spoilsport.

A breakdown of the uptrend line of the developing wedge pattern is the first sign that momentum is waning. The first support on the downside is the 50-day SMA, below which the LTC/USD pair can decline to $47.2460. Hence, please keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $55.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of $163.89 but might face some resistance at $177.30. If the bulls scale above this resistance, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $222.78–$249.60.

Both the moving averages have started to trend up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls have a slight edge. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies, hence, we recommend holding the long positions with the stops at $140. The pair will weaken below $125.88 and will turn negative below $105.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) is currently consolidating in the $15.63–$18 range for the past four days. This is a positive sign, as this confirms that the bulls are holding on to their long positions even at the critical overhead resistance of $18. Both the moving averages continue to trend up and the RSI is close to overbought territory.

A breakout and close above the overhead resistance of $18 can carry the BNB/USD pair toward lifetime highs. This will be a big sentiment booster, as this will confirm that the recovery is on track and select digital currencies have started a bull market of their own.

But if the pair turns down from $18, it can correct to the 20-day EMA, below which the drop can extend to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, we suggest traders protect their remaining long positions with the stops at $15.

XLM/USD

Though Stellar (XLM) has been trading above the 20-day EMA for the past two days, it is yet to pick up momentum. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.

If the XLM/USD pair does not move up within the next couple of days, it is likely to break below the 20-day EMA once again and drop to the uptrend line. This is a critical support, below which the trend will turn negative.

Contrary to our assumption, if the pair moves up sharply from the current levels, it can reach $0.13250273. If this level is scaled, the next level to watch is the long-term downtrend line, which is a major resistance. For now, traders can retain the stops on the long positions at $0.08.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) has continued to move up towards its second target objective of $0.080. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command.

Traders can book partial profits closer to $0.0750 and trail the stops on the remaining long positions to break even. It is always a good idea to book partial profits and reduce the risk because many times, the trade can turn around in a jiffy and, turn a profit into a loss.

After booking partial profits, the remaining positions can be trailed with a loose stop loss that will give some wiggle room to the ADA/USD pair. We shall watch the resistance zone of $0.080–$0.094256 closely before deciding the next move.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair reverses direction sharply from the current levels and plunges below $0.051468.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) has broken out of the 20-day EMA and is currently at the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance will propel the digital currency to $0.02815521. If the price sustains above $0.02815521, it is likely to start a new uptrend. Therefore, we might suggest long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521.

On the other hand, if the TRX/USD pair turns down either from the downtrend line or $0.02815521, it will remain range-bound for a few more weeks. The flat moving averages and RSI just above the midpoint suggest an equilibrium between the buyers and sellers. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown and close below $0.01830. Until then, volatile range-bound action will continue.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), in an official notification published on March 27, mentioned that via its ICO the Swiss mining company raised more than CHF 90 million (around $90.3 million) from more than 37,000 investors in early 2018. However, the company failed to follow the necessary statutory licensing requirements.

Already under liquidation

Founded in 2017, Envion AG was developing “mobile crypto mining units” involving clean energy. Last year, keeping pace with other blockchain-based firms, the Zug-based company issued tokens which could be bought with US dollar, Bitcoin, or Ethereum.

The mining company is currently under liquidation after receiving an order from the cantonal court of Zug in November 2018 for conducting an allegedly unauthorized ICO.

FINMA began probing Envion in July 2018 under the suspicion of the violation of Swiss financial market rules. In its recent statement, the watchdog agency said that the crypto company granted 30 years to investors after which they can claim their repayments. These “bond-like” instruments fall under the country’s Banking Act and thus requires a banking license.

The regulator also pointed out that the conditions under which the Zug-based company issued tokens were not equal for all its investors. In addition, the company did not even set up an internal audit unit which is required by the country’s laws.

“The conditions for the EVN tokens issued in a bond-like form were not equal for all investors, the prospectuses did not meet the minimum statutory requirements and there was no internal audit unit as required by law,” FINMA noted.

“In the present case, this acceptance of US dollars and the Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, therefore, amounted to an acceptance of public deposits for the purposes of the Banking Act. This, however, requires a banking license.”

However, it is not clear yet if the company, already in the liquidation process, will start refunding its investors or not.

Last week, the Swiss parliament approved a motion ordering the Federal Council to start adapting the existing legislation for digital currency regulation. Amid that, the council has announced that it has started a consultation period for introducing the new laws.",2019-03-29 08:14:41+00:00,,,

Today, March 30, crypto exchange Bithumb posted on Twitter that their cryptocurrency withdrawals and deposits have temporarily been paused.

In an explanation linked to the tweet, the exchange writes that at 10:15 (time zone unknown) on the 29th, they detected what they describe as abnormal withdrawals through their monitoring system.

The exchange notes that they have “secured all the cryptocurrency from the detection time with a cold wallet and checked them by blocking deposit and withdrawal service.”

According to the translated note, the incident was an “accident involving insiders.” In its updated blog post, Bithumb points out that it was the exchange’s fault that it only focused on protection from outside attacks and did not verify its staff. The announcement promises that the incident won’t repeat itself, since the company is developing its workforce verification system.

The exchange’s EOS hot wallet started sending EOS to the attacker’s address yesterday until the company realized the attack was ongoing and started to move the funds to the cold storage wallet, which seemingly has not been compromised.

More than 3 million EOS (about $12.5 million) have been transferred from the hot wallet. The company since pointed out that all the funds which have been stolen were those of the exchange, and that the users’ funds are in the cold wallet. According to cryptocurrency news outlet The Block Crypto, around 20 million Ripple (XRP) (equivalent to about $6.2 million) have also been stolen.

This is the second hack that the exchange encountered in under a year. In the investigation after the last hack, the exchange recovered $14 million of the stolen funds and the exchange stated that it expects to recover the losses this time as well. Bithumb claims to be currently conducting intensive investigations with the cyber police agency, the Korean internet & Security Agency (KISA) and cybersecurity companies.

The exchange also notes out that it expects to recover the to recover the loss. Lastly, the company notes:

“We will do our best to resume deposit and withdrawal as soon as possible to secure the service’s stability.”

An analysis of the flow of the stolen funds by a Twitter user shows that a portion of the funds is already being distributed to exchanges, while another portion has been moved to other addresses. The exchange that received the most funds (662,000 EOS) is EXMO, followed by Houbi (263,000 EOS), Changelly (192,000 EOS), ChangeNOW (140,000 EOS), KuCoin (96,000 EOS) and others.

Changelly has published a post today, claiming that the instant exchange has been able to identify and freeze 243,000 XRP ($76,000) and 114,000 EOS ($479,000) believed to be proceed from the Bithumb hack. The XRP has been sent to Changelly in eight different transactions, while the EOS was sent in 52, and the associated wallet addresses have been blacklisted.

A Twitter user has also suggested that the hack may be related to the recent BitHumb’s layoffs. Last week, it was reported that BitHumb is currently cutting up to 50 percent of its workforce.

Cointelegraph will update this story as it continues.

As Cointelegraph also recently reported, data scientists at blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus have published details of recent transactions from crypto exchange CoinBene that they consider to be suspect, beginning with $105 million in crypto swiftly being moved out of the exchange’s hot wallet.

With additional reporting from Adrian Zmudzinski.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-indias-election-impact-crypto-regulation/,"How India's Election Could Impact Crypto Regulation

India’s impending general election could affect the government’s process of regulating the crypto industry. A local lawyer has explained to news.Bitcoin.com how the election could impact regulations. According to the Indian Election Commission’s code of conduct rules, no new law can be passed during the election.

Also read: Indian Supreme Court Postpones Crypto Case at Government’s Request



Election Could Delay Crypto Regulation

India’s general election is approaching with the voting due to take place in seven phases between April 11 and May 19. The results will be announced on May 23. Explaining his interpretation of the law pertaining to how the election could have an impact on crypto regulation in India, lawyer Varun Sethi, founder of Blockchain Lawyer, told news.Bitcoin.com Saturday:

During election time in India, ‘aachar sanhita’ or code of conduct applies. Thereby no new law can be passed. Thereby we do not expect government to officially announce any regulation regarding cryptos or others.

Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, also shared with news.Bitcoin.com that “According to the Election Commission’s Model Code of Conduct, no major welfare policy decisions can be made once the dates for general elections have been set.” He elaborated, “Since the dates for the 2019 general elections have been made public, the government of India might be able to ‘postpone’ crypto-regulations until after the general elections.”

Sethi further noted, “Till the time the supreme court case is pending for [the] hearing, the government is shielded from making an announcement.” He also clarified that laws could be passed immediately after the results of the election are out since “The code of conduct applies prior to elections not post it.”

The Supreme Court of India gave the government four weeks on Feb. 25 to come up with a report on crypto regulation. The court expected to hear about the regulation on Friday from the interministerial committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. However, it adjourned at the request of the government’s counsel until July.

Crypto Regulation Not to Be Hurried

The Indian government has been drafting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency for quite some time. Garg previously said on television that a draft crypto regulation would be ready in July last year. However, the government has yet to announce any form of regulation for the crypto industry.

At the end of last year, the Ministry of Finance told Lok Sabha that “the department is pursuing the matter with due caution,” adding that “It is difficult to state a specific timeline to come up with clear recommendations.” Nonetheless, the government told the supreme court during the February hearing that the panel was in the final stages of deliberations.

Sethi further shared with news.Bitcoin.com:

Post election, the government as a populist measure may consider adoption of new technology and cryptos could benefit from it. However that would happen only if the supreme court passes other than negative order.

Gupta remarked that crypto regulation is “a critical decision so it should not be taken in a hurry,” emphasizing that it is “best to take time to come up with a good regulatory framework rather than taking any wrong steps.” He asserted that the “election could be the most probable reason” for the supreme court’s decision on Friday “as everyone is busy with general elections … and no one wants to hurry in such a critical step.”

Meanwhile, Reuters reported Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has predicted an easy victory, believing that “his ruling coalition would increase its majority in India’s upcoming election, despite some independent analysts suggesting it could disappear due to discontent over lack of jobs and depressed farm incomes.”

Swedbank says crypto tools of money laundering and terrorist financing

Transaction volumes low despite recovering prices

Ironically, Swedbank is now restrictive to cryptocurrency transactions because they want to prevent “money laundering and terrorist financing.” That’s after their publicized involvement in a $151 billion money laundering scandal. All in all, Bitcoin (BTC) prices are on up, trading above a main resistance trend line.

Bitcoin Price Analysis

Fundamentals

What a weird way to deal with emerging issues. Well, barely days after firing their CEO, Birgitte Bonnesen, Swedbank appears to be redirecting their booting muzzle to Bitcoin holders.

In their last Twitter post, translated to English, the bank said they “we are restrictive towards cryptocurrency transactions, to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.” The irony is that banks are paying huge fines as regulators crack down on their illegalities.

It was the same money laundering that had the Nordic bank come under scrutiny which in turn piled pressure on the bank’s operation forcing them to crack the whip.

“The developments during the past days have created enormous pressure for the bank. Therefore, the board has decided to dismiss Birgitte Bonnesen from her position. With that said, Birgitte Bonnesen has during her three years as CEO made an important contribution by creating a leading digital bank with a physical presence.”

Then again, evidence reveals that the transparent nature of cryptocurrencies and strict procedures adhered by fiat—crypto on-ramps makes it virtually impossible for criminals or in this case terrorist to launder money or finance their illicit activities.

Candlestick Arrangement

Back to price action and Bitcoin bulls are resilient. Gains are not double-digit but are trending above a central resistance trend line as mentioned in our last BTC/USD trade plan. As visible from the chart, bulls are building on from Mar 29 surprise gains, trading above $4,200—streams from BitFinex.

Technically, every low such be another buying opportunity and as long as prices are above $3,800, our breakout level, risk-off traders should fine-tune entries in lower time frames, add to their longs and target $4,500. The level as per our emphasis is a crucial resistance mark.

Any break above is monumental—and could happen next week, triggering participation that will play in with our projection of BTC prices retesting $4,500.

Technical Indicators

Despite prices closing above $4,200 on Mar 29, the breakout bar had light volumes—8.6k which is low relative to our high-volume anchor bar of Mar 16—13.4k. Regardless, the surge did confirm bulls of Mar 5 and the foundation of further higher highs above Feb 24—36k is on the cards. Moving on, and as aforementioned, traders should fine-tune their entries in lower time-frames.

Antminer 17 Series Available for Purchase on April 9

Bitcoin miners will be interested in the latest rigs that will be sold in the near future by the industry’s leading manufacturers. On Friday, Bitmain announced a sale date so the public can purchase devices from the Antminer 17 series which include the Antminer S17 Pro, Antminer S17, and the Antminer T17. The rigs will be sold globally on April 9, and come packed with Bitmain’s newly improved second generation 7nm ASIC BM1397 mining chips. During the announcement, Bitmain’s product manager of the latest Antminer series, Yangxin, revealed some details about the relationship between the company and the semiconductor foundry TSMC.

“The new miner offers a steep improvement in the hashrate in terms of space and power consumption,” Yangxin noted.

The BM1397 chips are produced using TSMC’s 7nm Finfet process and Yangxin claims the revamped 17 series will provide miners with 28.6 percent more efficiency than the previous 7nm equipped model using the BM1391. Yangxin stated that the future of mega-efficient SHA-256 miners will go beyond the 7nm scope. “From a technical point of view, there is no end to the development of technology. However, in the short run, the driving force behind the development of next-gen miners beyond 7nm chips is slowing down due to physical limitations,” Yangxin explained. The product manager continued:

With the nm size shrinking quantum effects, among other new challenges, come into play. It is promising that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) is already in the process of building 5nm chips.

Bitmain’s announcement does not reveal the new products’ hashrate but the previous Antminer S15 produces 28 trillion hashes per second (TH/s). The 17 series specifications will be available on the official website when the devices go up for sale. Yangxin did disclose that there is a noticeable performance improvement compared to the previous generation chip and the 17 series models have a “higher hashrate in a single miner.”

Canaan Reveals the New Avalonminer A10

Following Bitmain’s announcement, Chinese firm Canaan Creative released information on the launch of its latest Avalon series. Canaan announced the new Avalonminer A10 on the company’s official Wechat account on Friday as well. Interestingly, Canaan’s ad says that the new miner will go on sale in March 2019, yet the official sale date is still unknown. Moreover, during the spring, Chinese miners have been flocking to Sichuan for cheap electricity during the wet season and mining operations have been buying up rigs for new facilities.

Canaan does reveal some of the specifications tied to the A10 device which include 31TH/s and power consumption of around 1736W off the wall. This means the machine boasts a possible 50W/T (watt per terahash) at max capacity. Other details such as the new Avalon rig’s price per unit are still unknown. The news follows rumors of Canaan reapplying for the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong because it expired. The finance publication Securities Times also reported that Canaan raised “several hundred million U.S. dollars” on March 11. Bitmain’s IPO application expired as well and the company has recently disclosed that the corporation will also attempt to go public again by reapplying.

Cointelegraph Japan reported on the presentation the same day.

The new system would enable the Suica payment card issued by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Japan’s biggest railway company, to be topped-up with cryptocurrency. Still, the report points out that there are no concrete plans as of press time, and that JR East is only considering the implementation. Data released by the company shows that as of the end of March last year, nearly 70 million Suica cards were issued.

According to the dedicated website, Suica is a prepaid e-money card which allows its users to pay both for some goods and services, as well as transport. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Decurret has been allowed to operate by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) since March 28.

According to Cointelegraph Japan, the trading on the exchange will start on April 16th and will involve Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP). The addition of Ethereum (ETH) support is reportedly scheduled for June or July, and both yen and Bitcoin will be supported as base pairs.

In other Japanese news, e-commerce giant Rakuten will soon launch its own cryptocurrency exchange, dubbed Rakuten Wallet, after announcing that it received the FSA’s approval on March 25.",,https://www.coindesk.com/the-ultimate-irony-of-crypto-trading,"David Weisberger is co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes and a veteran of building trading desks and financial technology businesses. The opinions expressed in this article are his own, and do not reflect CoinDesk’s position.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.

We have all witnessed armies of “introducers” trolling around LinkedIn and Telegram advertising their access to buyers or sellers of bitcoin, coupled with hundreds of wannabe over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks whose only method of trading is to call wholesale market makers.

The irony of this is amazing, considering that one of the most important goals of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is to “eliminate middlemen” and remove frictional costs from the financial system. Today, however, bitcoin trading is done by more middlemen than in traditional finance, with the result that frictional trading costs are far higher than for non-digital assets.

Before delving into the silliness of the current market structure for trading crypto, it is important to note that I am a fervent believer in the potential for crypto to revolutionize the capital markets, eventually.

I have, on the record, stated that the ability of crypto market structure to support global capital formation and trading will eventually mean that all financial assets will trade digitally.

My reasoning is based on the ability of crypto exchanges, serving clients around the world, to trade the same asset against a variety of different currencies, cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. This can potentially eliminate a wide variety of intermediaries from markets that currently serve one geography trading in one currency per instrument. That being said, the current crypto OTC market is littered with intermediaries, all of whom extract their own commission.

Consider the following workflow diagram that represents a typical transaction in crypto today:

In this example, the investor is “represented” by an introducer, who wins from among five introducers that all talk to that investor. The winner contacts five OTC desks to “source liquidity” for its client. One desk is chosen, and it, in turn, contacts three market makers and chooses one for the trade.

The market maker then gives the client a price, after checking where they believe they can trade the order; the transaction is done with the client and the market maker trades out of the position via an exchange.

This model is, of course, quite inefficient. Paying a commission or implied spread to four different counterparties makes little sense, but even worse is the fact that each of the OTC desks and market makers contacted knows about the order’s existence. This, in turn, makes it likely that the market would move before the trade is consummated, magnifying the cost to the investor.

All is not lost, however, as there are legitimate options for investors that want to trade efficiently. For example, the most sophisticated large wholesale market makers have built excellent systems for trading across exchanges and other market makers. In addition, agent desks with smart order routing systems are being established. From the perspective of investors, however, it can be hard to discern each firm’s real capabilities. That makes it difficult for investors to find the best trading desk to suit their needs.

My advice to investors is to ask the following questions when evaluating a trading firm:

1. Does it trade against my order flow as “principal”? (I.e., does it take the other side of the trade by committing their own capital?)

The answer is vital, as it tells you immediately if you are facing off with a proprietary trading desk. If the answer is “yes” that is neither bad nor good, but it does have important implications – it means that you are likely trading without having to pay an extra intermediary (good), but, unless the desk contacted you first, you should only trade with them if you need immediacy. That is because immediate liquidity comes with a cost, and you end up paying too much in the implied spread.

Additionally, if you contact multiple desks to source your trade, you are leaking a lot of information to the market, and desks will often “pre-hedge” ahead of consummating the trade. That is very expensive as it amounts to legal “frontrunning” that will move the price against you.

If, however, the desk you are talking to does not commit capital, that is also neither good nor bad, depending on their process and relationships. If they are acting as an agent and have a bonafide “natural” counterparty to the trade or if they have a sophisticated algorithmic trading platform, they can provide substantial value. In the case of “natural” counterparties, however, be suspicious as most of those claims in the crypto market tend to be false.

Algorithmic platforms built for the crypto markets are typically the most cost-efficient trading alternative. Once again, be careful to understand if the desk you are talking to trades for their own account also. If they do, ask for their procedures in writing that stop them from trading ahead of or alongside your order. If they don’t provide that, assume that they are going to use your trade to make trading profits.

2. How and where does the firm source liquidity and what does it charge to do so? Is that charge reflected as commission or a markup/markdown from the price?

Asking where your OTC desk is sourcing liquidity is also vital. If it relies exclusively on other OTC desks, find another one. Why do you need an intermediary desk to talk to firms that will take your call themselves? That means you are paying an extra desk, for no reason. In addition, you would be losing control over your order. Sadly, such desks are very common and probably make up the bulk of the trading universe. If, however, they have a robust platform with access to a combination of OTC desks and exchanges, the next question becomes key.

3. What electronic trading tools does the firm utilize and how do they interact with “public” markets?

If your OTC desk uses a combination of single exchange or OTC desk interfaces, be extremely suspicious.

It is almost impossible for a trader to simultaneously survey all markets and calculate the optimal pieces of the order to send to markets over an order’s full life. The answer you should be looking for is that the desk has an algorithmic trading system with maximum connectivity and access to data.

That statement is considered self-evident in other asset classes, but not in crypto. Now that such tools for trading crypto exist, it is time for crypto investors to take notice and demand their agents use them.

In conclusion, it is about time for investors in the crypto markets to start caring about best execution, which will help them earn greater returns while improving the market structure overall.

That is important as such improvement will help attract reluctant institutional investors that are leery of rapid price moves and the difficulty of discerning the price of liquidity.

Two companies from different parts of Europe have recently announced new products that cater to the financial needs of businesses in the crypto industry. The services range from opening bank accounts to providing payment processing solutions. Developers say they will give crypto companies the peace of mind they need to focus on their core activities without having to worry about banking.

British Company to Open Bank Accounts for Crypto Businesses

Coinacquiring, a London-based consulting firm, has announced it now offers help in opening “crypto-friendly bank accounts” for companies in the sector. The corporate banking assistance will expand its portfolio, which already includes another sought after service, fiat-to-crypto payment processing provided to merchants accepting digital currencies.

The bank accounts will be available in multiple fiat currencies including British pound, euro, U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen, along with many other currencies such as Czech koruna, Romanian leu and South African rand, for example. They will also support SEPA instant credit transfers and wire transfers via Swift.

Banking and payment processing services are in high demand in the sector and the company receives several requests a day as David Jones, senior payments consultant at Coinacquiring, told news.Bitcoin.com. Jones believes banks turn the crypto businesses away because they don’t fully understand how to evaluate risk in the crypto industry.

To provide more security and stability to cryptocurrency merchants, Coinacquiring maintains relationships with a number of traditional financial institutions. “We have several Tier 1 European banks we work with and also options with smaller banks further afield,” the company representative assured.

Coinacquiring charges a fixed $500 account opening fee and additional fees are negotiated directly between the merchant and the respective bank. Jones added that these processing rates typically tend to be between 3 and 5 percent.

“We know how difficult fiat to crypto payment processing can be to set up,” David Jones was quoted as saying in a press release sent by the company earlier this week. “We want to create a space where crypto businesses can focus on building exciting products and technologies instead of having to worry about whether their banking infrastructure is reliable or not,” he emphasized.

Coinacquiring also offers assistance with opening foreign exchange accounts, although this service is not that frequently requested. “As an extension to this we will look to provide some treasury management solutions for exchanges working in multiple fiat currencies. However, this is a few months off,” Jones explained.

The consultant noted that there are currently plenty of crypto-to-fiat payment processing options and Coinacquiring wouldn’t be filling a void if it decided to offer this kind of service too. “As we grow I guess it makes sense to include this for completeness more than anything else,” Jones remarked when asked about the company’s plans for the future.

Belarusians Develop Crypto-to-Fiat Payment Processing Software

Meanwhile, a new crypto-to-fiat payment processing system has been developed in Eastern Europe, despite strong existing competition in this niche. One of the established companies in the field, Paytomat, already has a network of merchants accepting cryptocurrencies using its services for instant conversion to local fiat. Their clients are based in a dozen countries around the world, from Ukraine to Venezuela.

Now Synell, an IT company headquartered in Belarus and with offices in Russia and the U.S., is promoting its offering to the growing market, its software capable of processing direct crypto payments and converting digital coins to fiat money for businesses that wish to provide their customers with the option to pay with cryptocurrency.

The platform, called Acquiring, can accept payments in three major digital currencies – bitcoin core (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). The developers note, however, that support for other coins can be added upon request from interested parties. The team has also developed an API and a mobile application that enables users to receive payments directly at their store checkout.

The software package is now up for sale and offered to companies that would like to invest more time and effort into its further development and integration, Synell CEO Denis Gorskin told news.Bitcoin.com. The crypto payment processing platform, which costs $18,000, was originally designed for Russian clients but it can be adapted to any other market and already has an English-language version.

Very few people expect the Bitcoin ETF to see the light of the day in 2019. Hence, even if it is not approved, the impact on crypto prices is likely to be limited. However, if the ETF is approved, it will be a pleasant surprise and will give a major boost to crypto prices.

Currently, the recovery is not led by Bitcoin: it is the altcoins that are dragging Bitcoin prices higher. Based on options data, traders are giving only a 5 percent chance for Bitcoin to reach $10,000 by September of this year. We believe that if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $4,255, the markets will start pricing in a greater probability of touching higher levels this year. Though we expect some sharp rallies during the year, we do not anticipate them to be similar to 2017.

Argentina’s deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, said that promoting crypto will reduce the demand for U.S. dollars in the Latin American nation and stabilize the local markets. Increasingly, nations are warming up to the vast potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This will attract more investors to the asset class, as they see the transformation that the technology can bring about in their economies. Though slow in catching up, price will eventually follow fundamentals, and altcoins have been soaring in the past few weeks. Let’s look at the best performers of the past seven days.

XTZ/USDT

Tezos (XTZ) has been one of the stronger altcoins in the past few days, as its price has been buoyed by some fundamental events that brought cheers to the investors. The community has completed voting on the protocol proposal that will decide the upgrade of Tezos, and the proposal is now entering an Exploration Vote Period (or “Testing_vote period”). The markets also cheered the additional grant received by Cryptium labs to develop baking and consensus improvements for the Tezos core protocol.

Coinbase Custody is offering staking services with Tezos (XTZ) to attract institutional players, wherein investors can make about 6.6 percent annual return and a client’s assets will be kept in a cold storage at all times, making the process risk-free. The Tezos foundation intimated that PwC Switzerland has completed the 2017 statutory audit, and that the same has been filed with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations. PwC is also conducting the audit for 2018.

With these positive fundamental developments, can the rally continue or will it hit a roadblock? Let’s find out.

The XTZ/USDT pair traded in a tight range of about 16 weeks before breaking out to the upside. Last week, though the breakout of the $0.33-$0.654310 range could not be sustained, the pair has followed it with another up move this week. This shows a likely change in trend. In this up move, the digital currency has broken out of the 20-week EMA and can now rally to the 50-week SMA at $1.73. There is a minor resistance at $1.295480, but we expect it to be crossed.

Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to scale $1.294580, the digital currency might consolidate for a few more weeks. The recovery will lose steam if the price plummets below $0.654310 once again.

ADA/USD

The official arm of Cardano (ADA) announced that the popular Ledger Nano S now supports the cryptocurrency, which will help users hold their assets securely. Also, 19 Ethiopian and four Ugandans students graduated from IOHK’s Haskell Course: these software developers will use blockchain technology to solve various problems in the Ethiopian agriculture industry. Charles Hoskinson, founder of IOHK, expects that in about three to five years, information can be moved between different systems, noting that the crypto industry is still waiting for the “WiFi or Bluetooth moment.”

The ADA/USD pair has extended its recovery with another strong week: it is now nearing the overhead resistance zone of $0.082952 to $0.094256. If the bulls scale this zone and the 50-week SMA that is just above it, a rally to $0.20 in the medium-term is possible. However, in the short-term, we expect $0.082952 to $0.094256 to act as a strong hurdle. A few weeks of consolidation close to this zone cannot be ruled out.

On the downside, any pullback is likely to find support at the 20-week EMA and below it at $0.051468. If the bulls fail to defend this support, the pair will again weaken.

Traders who have purchased 50 percent of their desired allocation on our previous recommendation can continue to hold with the stop at $0.0350. We shall watch the price action for one more week and then suggest trailing the stops higher.

EOS/USD

EOS continues to hold the first position in the Chinese government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies, and Weiss Crypto Ratings gave a ranking of “A” to EOS for its challenge to Ethereum. As of January, 48 percent of DApps users were on EOS, way higher than the 28 percent on the Ethereum network. In another hack on the Bithumb exchange, more than 3 million EOS was transferred out from the exchange’s hot wallet. Let’s see how the price is reacting to this news.

After consolidating for about four weeks, the EOS/USD pair has resumed its recovery. It will now again attempt to breakout of the overhead resistance at $4.4930. If successful, it can rally to $6.8299. The 50-week SMA is just below this level; hence, we expect $6.8299 to act as a major roadblock. But during the next pullback, if the pair manages to stay above $4.4930, it will indicate strength and will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels.

Following a breakout above $6.8299, we expect the virtual currency to pick up momentum. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint: this shows that the selling pressure has reduced and a new uptrend is likely. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price fails to climb above $4.4930 and breaks below $3.8723.

BNB/USD

Binance announced a new lottery format for the next token sale on Binance Launchpad. This is a change from the first-come-first-serve basis that was used for the previous successful token launches. Binance has also partnered with risk management and compliance firm IdentityMind to improve data protection and compliance for Binance’s global operations. The week also saw reports that many crypto exchanges were reporting fake volumes. The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, welcomed these reports, as it will help to make the industry more transparent.

The BNB/USD pair is leading the altcoin recovery from the front. After the recent recovery, it is only about 35 percent from the lifetime highs hit in January 2018. This shows that select cryptocurrencies have emerged from their bear markets and are on track to challenge the lifetime highs.

Currently, the pair is facing some profit booking at the major resistance of $18. We anticipate a few more weeks of consolidation, or a minor correction before the bulls again attempt to breakout of $18 and make a new lifetime high. On the downside, the digital currency will find support at $14 and below it at the 20-week EMA. The moving averages are completing a bullish crossover, which shows that the trend has changed.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down and sustains below the 50 percent retracement of the recent rally.

NEO/USD

NEO prices received a boost when Nash.io, a decentralized exchange built on top of NEO, announced that it has finalized the protocol spec for Bitcoin trading. In another news, Binance has added additional stablecoin pairings for NEO that might help drive up the volume for the cryptocurrency.

The NEO/USD pair has reached the top of the $5.48080-$10.00 range, and is currently facing resistance at the 20-week EMA. The rise from the low of the range to the current levels has been gradual, which shows an accumulation by the bulls. If it breaks out of the 20-week EMA, it might pick up momentum and rally to $17 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $24.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current levels once again, it might extend its stay in the range for a few more weeks.",,https://cryptobriefing.com/bankera-bnk-token-spectrocoin/,"Share this article

What Is Bankera?

Bankera is a full-suite blockchain-based banking replacement developed by cryptocurrency exchange/wallet company SpectroCoin. Bitcoin was hailed as a replacement for traditional banking, but it’s only a currency (and a difficult one to spend). Consumer banks offer a full suite of financial services, such as loans, IBAN deposit accounts, payment cards, and more. Bankera uses blockchain technology and cryptoassets to provide these traditional banking services.

London-based SpectroCoin (not to be confused with SpectreCoin) was founded in 2013 by a group of Lithuanian developers as an all-in-one Bitcoin solution to provide frictionless financial services. The team created a blockchain-based cryptocurrency exchange, wallet, and payment card that’s accepted anywhere bitcoin is accepted, along with other European merchants. It also provides merchant services to partners. It since expanded to support over 30 crypto and fiat currencies in over 150 countries.

Bankera is a soft fork of SpectroCoin that launched June 2017. It leverages the tools the team developed to create a full-service banking solution on the blockchain. With SpectroCoin’s heritage and a clear eye for what it takes for banks to survive in today’s complicated global regulatory environment, Bankera looks like a homerun.

But it also has a lot of work ahead before it can compete with the “too big to fail” banks around the world. Let’s start our exploration of this ambitious project by examining the cryptocurrency market performance of Banker (BNK), Bankera’s native cryptocurrency coin.

BNK Cryptocurrency Summary

The peak price of BNK was $0.011372 on June 5, 2018. The total supply is 25,000,000,000 BNK, and it is an ERC-223 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Bankera pre-ICO occurred from August 28, 2017 through September 19, 2017, at which time 2,500,000,000 were sold to accredited private investors. The ICO was held from November 27, 2017 through February 27, 2018. ETH, BTC, USD, XEM, and DASH was accepted through the ICO. The Bankera ICO sold approximately 5,250,000,000 BNK (70 percent of the 7.5 billion available for sale) and raised approximately 150,949,194 EUR.

Per Bankera, the remaining BNK was then distributed among initial pre-ICO and ICO investors. A secondary coin offering (SCO) is planned when the price of 1 Banker token surpasses 0.1 EUR in value. This SCO of 7.5 billion would bring the total circulating supply to 17,500,000,000, with the remaining 7,500,000,000 being withheld by the founding and development team.

According to the white paper, 20 percent of Bankera and SpectroCoin transaction revenue will be paid to BNK holders on a weekly basis. This makes it “mineable” through Proof-of-Stake revenue sharing.

BNK trading is currently reserved to the HitBTC cryptocurrency exchange, at which approximately $30,000 worth of BNK is traded daily. Its trading pairs are BTC, ETH, and USDT.

Of course, BNK is also tradeable on SpectroCoin, the proprietary exchange it forked from. Here, it’s useable in the entire SpectroCoin ecosystem, making it fully tradeable with over 30 crypto and fiat currencies. Over 800,000 EUR worth of transaction volume is processed daily through SpectroCoin.

The SpectroCoin wallet is the official BNK wallet, although third-party ERC223-compatible wallets will accept BNK too. Because ERC-223 is backwards compatible with ERC-20, this includes ERC-20 wallets too.

Profiling the Root of All Evil

Banks do more than just launder…I mean store…our money. They actually provide a slew of services. With USAA, for example, you can get a savings account, checking account, mortgage, insurance, auto loan, make investments, and more. Because of this wide range of offerings, USAA is regulated by a lot of state and federal regulators.

Everyone from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Trade Commision to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Housing and Urban Development & Federal Housing Administration, and the New York Department of Financial Services have a hand in regulating bank matters, as do each state and federal Attorney General.

In the interest of full disclosure, I worked for American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Countrywide, and Bank of America in my 20’s. I worked in mostly operational roles, although I’m also familiar with customer-facing roles like credit card collections, debit card fraud, and even membership rewards customer service. After blowing the whistle, I worked with investigators from many of these regulators.

Not only do banks offer a wide variety of financial products and services, but they offer them on a lot of platforms. Bank of America has a powerful mobile app, AI-assisted customer service, and a broad network of ATMs and physical branches providing customers everything they need.

Even smaller regional banks and credit unions like Navy Federal Credit Union offer many of these advanced technical features.

For Bankera to pull off its ambitions of replacing banking with a blockchain-based solution, it’s going to need to satisfy regulators, customers, and investors. It’s not an easy feat to pull off, so let’s find out what tricks the project has up its sleeves to go to war with the big boys of banking.

Fighting the Devil with a Demon

SpectroCoin wasn’t trying to build a cryptocurrency bank, but to compete in today’s flooded blockchain market, the team built a cryptocurrency exchange, web-based wallet, debit card provider, payment processor, foreign currency exchange, and more.

Listing a cryptocurrency on an exchange market requires interacting with the network’s API. Exchange wallets basically have to mine all the cryptos they hold. And they have to connect to networks like SWIFT to process fiat payments.

With this infrastructure already in place, the SpectroCoin team decided to fork in order to create two separate products. This maintains a divide between the asset-exchange market and consumer banking services.

While SpectroCoin continued focusing on building its smart-contract support up, Bankera was created to become a fully regulated banking entity. Supporting and maintaining a network of APIs is similar to the sidechain support proposed by members of the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance. In this aspect, the team wisely pivoted its exchange’s capabilities into a banking blockchain competing with blockchain 3.0 projects like Polymath, Wanchain, Pundi X, and OmiseGO instead of exchanges like Huobi and Binance.

By splitting the project, SpectroCoin will continue developing crypto support, while Bankera can focus on integrating its blockchain into both brick-and-mortar and e-retail. Like Pundi X, the more merchants the network onboards, the more payment options are provided to consumer users.

Regulators will also be appeased – crypto publications focus a lot on whether cryptocurrencies are currencies, commodities, or securities. The reality is all crypto and blockchain projects are going to be heavily scrutinized by more than one regulator in the U.S. alone. Big banks earned their stripes battling every level of government simultaneously. Much of my job at Bank of America was adapting to regulation as fast as the government could issue it.

If cryptocurrencies want to replace banks, they’ll need to prove they can withstand heavy government scrutiny while providing innovative services to consumers and defending against outside attacks.

If Bankera can pull it off, it’ll prove it’s in the same league as the big boys, with all the fortune and consequences that comes with that position.

Bankera Summary

Bankera is the banking fork of the Lithuanian-built, London based SpectroCoin exchange. Financial services, whether fiat or crypto, are highly regulated, and this move allows for sharing of resources and nimble navigation of regional regulations around the globe. Bankera’s success hinges on these key factors.

Banker (BNK), the native cryptocurrency of Bankera, is an Ethereum-based ERC-223 token. This upgrade is backwards compatible with the ERC-20 standard.

Bankera and SpectroCoin provide cross-platform support for over 30 crypto and fiat currencies. There’s an exchange, wallet, and debit card, with more banking services like loans and investments on the way.

Bankera also has a retail POS platform for physical and e-retail stores to help facilitate crypto payments on both sides of the marketplace.

With these pieces in place, Bankera is well-positioned to become a major player, at least in the European marketplace. However, one can only wonder if the team is ready for what that position of power actually means.",2019-03-30 13:10:03+00:00

The central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), issued a circular in April last year banning banks from providing services to crypto businesses including exchanges. The ban went into effect in July and banks closed the accounts of crypto exchanges at that time.

The banking restriction has put many crypto businesses in limbo. Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, was forced to close down its exchange operations in the country in September last year.

A number of industry participants have filed writ petitions against the ban which the supreme court originally scheduled to hear in September last year. However, the case has repeatedly been postponed. During the most recent hearing which took place on Friday, the court adjourned without addressing the ban until at least July.

Expensive to Run an Exchange

The team at Coindelta, an 18-month-old exchange, explained that “Running the exchange is very expensive in such [an] unfavourable environment.” Noting that “We have been operating at a minimal trade fee, bearing all the costs ourselves ensuring that your trading experience remains unaffected in the current unregulated environment,” the team admitted:

It has been really difficult for us to operate Coindelta exchange for the last 6 months … Economically, it’s no longer viable to continue with the exchange.

According to Saturday’s announcement, Coindelta’s exchange services were suspended and all open orders canceled in all markets at 2:00 p.m. (Indian time) on March 30. However, the wallet services will continue until April 29.

Customers Forced to Withdraw Funds at High Fees

Coindelta has requested that its customers withdraw all their funds within 30 days of the suspension, after which all requests must be submitted to support. “There will be a fixed fee applicable on all the withdrawals,” the exchange warned.

According to the Indian crypto community, these fees are high compared to what other exchanges are charging. For example, “they increased the XRP withdrawal fees to 10 XRP,” Coindcx CEO Sumit Gupta told news.Bitcoin.com, emphasizing that this fee is “a lot” since his exchange charges 0.01 XRP for withdrawals. Coindelta’s BTC withdrawal fee is 0.002 BTC, worth about $8.19 at the time of writing.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange Wazirx, tweeted that he “Got many messages that withdrawal fees from Coindelta have been increased,” adding that his exchange is offering Coindelta’s users 100 percent refund of withdrawal fees if they switch to Wazirx.

Another Indian exchange, Bitbns, has made a similar offer. “We are waiving off/refunding any fee incurred while depositing funds to Bitbns from any other cryptocurrency exchange across the world. This means you can now transfer your funds from any crypto exchange to Bitbns without bearing any transfer charges,” the exchange announced on Sunday.

What do you think of the Indian supreme court taking so long to end the RBI ban that Coindelta has to shut down? Let us know in the comments section below.

Need to calculate your bitcoin holdings? Check our tools section.",2019-03-31 07:58:18+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/what-is-cryptocurrency-1.4876417,"Cryptocurrency is big business.

Despite only coming into the public consciousness a decade ago with the invention of bitcoin, it's developed into a multibillion-dollar industry.

A tumultuous year in 2018 saw bitcoin's value skyrocket to nearly $150 billion Cdn before dropping to just a fraction of what it was once worth, and more than a dozen other coins began to catch up, with market caps creeping into the billions.

And recently Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX went into a tailspin after news its founder had died — leaving customers no way to access roughly $190 million worth of digital currency.

Despite its growth, for many people not involved in tech cryptocurrency is still a big unknown. Here are answers to some questions you might have.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is digital currency, but that's not what makes it unique.

""We've had digital currency for years,"" said Ben Perrin, head of marketing at Calgary-based cryptocurrency brokerage BitNational and host of an educational cryptocurrency YouTube channel.

Perrin said it's estimated the amount of legal tender around the world that exists in a physical form is only between two and 11 per cent, with the rest being stored digitally.

That's no surprise to anyone who uses their debit card or Apple Pay more often than cash.

Instead, cryptocurrency is different from government-issued legal tender in two big ways.

Encrypted, decentralized

First, it's encrypted — hence the ""crypto"" part of its name. The creation of coins and transactions are verified by a type of cryptography.

Second, it's decentralized, so it gets rid of the middle man.

""Banks run on the fractional-reserve system, making them the intermediary between borrowers and savers,"" said Perrin.

Records of deposits and withdrawals at banks are all recorded on a ledger. Some of that money ends up in circulation, but the rest is held by the bank.

Cryptocurrencies also use a ledger, but a decentralized one called the blockchain (more on that below). It records transactions publicly, on servers around the world, cutting out the need for a central bank to manage and hold on to that money.

Why do people use cryptocurrency?

For some, the appeal of cryptocurrency is that it's a currency system separate from banks and governments.

So, hypothetically, a corrupt government can't shut it down and it wouldn't be hit by a banking crisis, like the stock market crash of the 1930s.

That's because most of the currencies aren't controlled by a corporation or run on a central server.

""Like, compare Napster to Bittorrent,"" said Perrin.

Napster was a file-sharing site that was shut down in the early 2000s after a court injunction due to complaints of copyright infringement. Users uploaded their own files directly to the server, making it easy for the government to pull the plug on the file transfers.

After Napster's demise came more resilient sites like BitTorrent, that instead split up the downloads to host files on computers around the world.

""When the government took down Napster, it's because it was one central file-sharing site.

""They can't take down BitTorrent, because it's a network hosted on servers around the world. Even if they pulled all the Canadian servers, the torrents would still be up.""

Comparing the Canadian dollar to Napster isn't exactly flattering, but if you talk to some cryptocurrency advocates, that's exactly how they view government-issued currencies — risky, and soon-to-be defunct.

Secure, anonymous

So for many, the security and anonymity of cryptocurrency is a big draw.

But it's not the only reason people buy in. Some are speculative investors, hoping to make a buck off coins that are rapidly rising in value.

Others like that it can be a fast and inexpensive way to transfer large sums.

And others are experimenting with the blockchain technology itself, seeing how it can be used to push past the traditional definition of money.

What is the blockchain?

The easiest way to explain the blockchain is using the mother of all cryptocurrencies — bitcoin.

It was invented in 2008 by an anonymous inventor (or group of inventors) who call themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin uses the blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that publicly records all transactions.

On the blockchain, a bunch of different people around the globe hold onto identical copies of the transaction ledger on their computers.

Those computers are called nodes.

A map shows the distribution of all of the more than 10,000 reachable bitcoin nodes across the globe as of Oct. 24. Each node is a copy of the distributed ledger — all of them would have to be shut down for the currency to be taken down. (BitNodes/Google Maps)

Each time a transaction happens, the nodes have to independently update and verify it from chunks of data called blocks, which are strung along in a chain that together comprises the entire record of transactions that have occurred, going back to the first bitcoin ever transferred in 2009.

Those blocks are verified by miners.

What is mining?

Bitcoin miners keep the blockchain running by verifying outstanding transactions.

This makes sure no coins are sent or deposited twice.

Each block contains a collection of unconfirmed transactions, the timestamps of the transactions, and a reference to the last transaction on the ledger that was confirmed.

Miners set a computer program to work solving a difficult mathematical puzzle that's unique to each block.

The program crunches numbers until it spits out a string of letters and numbers — a hash — that act as a proof the miner has solved the block's puzzle and verified the transaction. That proof then gets broadcast to all the other nodes to confirm they're on the same page.

If the nodes come to a consensus, the transaction gets added to the ledger and each miner starts work on a new block.

A lucrative operation

So what's in it for miners to keep the network going? Well, they get paid in bitcoin for verifying the transactions.

There's a finite amount of bitcoin and the individual coins have risen sharply in value since the network began, meaning that mining can be quite lucrative especially in places where electricity is cheap.

One bitcoin mining facility near Drumheller, Alta., has dug up hundreds of bitcoins so far. For context, a single bitcoin's value fluctuated between $7,000 and $19,000 Cdn in 2018.

And many people have chosen to lend their home computing power to bitcoin mining operations as well, earning between dozens and hundreds of dollars a month above their power bills.

Is bitcoin the only cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency and, currently, the most valuable.

But Perrin said there are more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies — colloquially called altcoins, or alternatives to bitcoin — most of which are wildly different from each other. And that number is rapidly growing.

""Some cryptocurrencies are similar to cash, where they can be used in exchange for goods or services, while others function more like an asset like gold — so they can either be held, like a bond, or used as a raw material for other products,"" he said.

Examples include:

Ripple, a network that allows cross-border currency exchanges within seconds.

Ether, which powers smart software applications that can do things like make online voting more secure.

VeChain, which lets retailers track and collect data on products as they move through the supply chain.

How do you buy cryptocurrency?

The first thing you need to buy cryptocurrency is a wallet — and not the leather kind you keep in your pocket.

""Funds should always be stored in a wallet, digital or paper,"" said Perrin.

A wallet is a software program that stores private and public keys that are used to send and receive cryptocurrency.

Ben Perrin of BitNational demonstrates how to transfer funds using a cryptocurrency wallet at a workshop in Calgary. The wallet key QR codes have been blurred. A screen in the back shows all of the nodes in the global bitcoin network. (Sarah Rieger/CBC)

A wallet can be as complicated as an app on your phone or computer, or a string of numbers you write down on a piece of paper.

But be careful — if you lose your keys, your cryptocurrency will be gone forever.

There's no way to recover those coins because it's not stored or backed up centrally, the way you can still access your bank account if you lose your debit card.

Instead, all of the transactions are sent between keys.

Funds are sent to a public key — that's kind of like an email address an e-transfer is sent to. Then you can access your money with a private key, which functions like your password and should be kept secret.

Once you have a wallet set up, you can buy currency at either ATMs or at brokers or currency exchanges.

But while you can trade between Canadian dollars and cryptocurrency on an online exchange, you should never leave your money sitting in one like you would with a bank, said Perrin.

""It's like a honeypot for hackers. And it's much less safe than a bank, as exchanges are newer and they have varying levels of security.""

That's a hard lesson clients of the aforementioned QuadrigaCX learned.

What can you buy with cryptocurrency?

While bitcoin initially gained notoriety for being used to purchase illegal goods like drugs on the dark web, it has a variety of legitimate uses.

Coffee shops, clothing stores and other businesses across Canada accept cryptocurrencies.

In Calgary, an office building accepts lease payments in cryptocurrency, and another company will let you pay for your renovations in bitcoin or ether.

Do you have to pay taxes on it?

Yes, even though cryptocurrency is touted as an anonymous investment, the Canada Revenue Agency's rules still apply to all digital currency transactions as it's considered a commodity.

Investors are expected to keep track of their own trades and report any profits as part of their income.

The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada has a website with advice and information on the laws surrounding cryptocurrencies.

Why does the price of cryptocurrency fluctuate so much?

Since cryptocurrencies aren't backed by governments, the coins' only value is assigned by those who decide it has worth — meaning that value can fluctuate wildly.

The combination of very few coins in the market and speculation-fueled demand led to a meteoric rise in late 2017, followed by a massive crash in January 2018 — bigger than the tech stock crash during the dot-com bubble.

But that hasn't dampened the coins' appeal for advocates who say cryptocurrency has the long-term potential to be a game-changer in the global economy.

(Sarah Rieger/CBC)",,https://news.bitcoin.com/interesting-paying-crypto-accounts-are-this-years-leading-trend/,"Interest-Paying Crypto Accounts Are This Year’s Leading Trend

2019 has witnessed a Cambrian explosion of crypto interest schemes. Previously, the only way to make a passive income on your cryptocurrency was through hodling and hoping it would rise in dollar terms, or to operate a masternode for a dubious altcoin. Today’s investors have it a whole lot easier thanks to a string of new savings programs that promise annual interest simply for locking up digital assets.

Crypto Companies Are Borrowing From the Fiat Banking Toolbox

Last week, Nexo became the latest crypto company to introduce interest to its customers, with the provision of up to 6.5 percent annually on stablecoins DAI, PAX, USDC, USDT, and TUSD. Interest will be compounded daily and funds will be protected by custodial insurance. Unlike most of the crypto interest schemes to have emerged this year, Nexo enables its clients to withdraw any amount of cryptocurrency at any time. As such, their crypto account essentially becomes a checking account, stocked with dollar-pegged tokens, but bolstered by the promise of annual interest that exceeds that of most fiat saving accounts.

Nexo is by no means alone in incentivizing customers to secure their crypto in a custodial account and be rewarded. Blockfi will disburse 6 percent annually to clients who store ETH or BTC deposits. Ledgerx introduced its own interest-bearing BTC account last year for U.S. investors, while Compound provides up to 4.2 percent annually for assets such as DAI. At the start of March, Universal Protocol Alliance announced a stablecoin that would pay interest of up to 10 percent per year.

Cryptocurrency users have never had more options in terms of where to store their digital assets. Having had it drummed into them for years that noncustodial wallets are the best place to stash their coins, long-term hodlers now find themselves torn on account of the attractive interest rates offered by third parties. Even with the promise of full custodial cover, cryptocurrency owners face a dilemma: to seek the sanctity and privacy of storing funds in a noncustodial wallet, or to raise the risk a little in return for a generous 6 percent.

Balancing the Risks and Rewards of Interest-Bearing Crypto Accounts

When Blockfi announced its crypto interest scheme, eagle-eyed readers scrutinizing the terms and conditions spotted that the assets would not be insured against losses. While offerings from the likes of Nexo and Coinbase Custody are fully insured, consumers should nevertheless familiarize themselves with the small print before committing. Coinbase hasn’t begun offering crypto interest accounts per se, it should be noted: rather, it’s added staking as a service, which obliges hodlers to lock up qualifying Proof of Stake coins such as tezos (XTZ). The end result to clients is much the same as receiving interest however; by the time Coinbase has taken its 2 percent, stakers will be left with an annual yield of around 6 percent.

Staking and interest are not the same, as industry commenters such as Meltem Demirors have been keen to stress. For the end user, however, be it an institutional client who doesn’t want to “get their hands dirty” with the technical side of staking, or a retail client who doesn’t want to assume custody for their crypto, the outcome can appear indistinguishable. “Financialization of Bitcoin is inevitable and vitally important,” argued Zane Pocock in a Medium post on March 29. He continued:

Financialized structures allow for much better liquidity, debt structures, and other benefits that mean institutional custody and lending can be good for Bitcoin.

Pocock urged investors to do their own research into the interest accounts being offered by crypto companies and not to “fall for the illusion of free money. Bitcoin is our emergency exit from the outcomes of precisely that fallacy.” Crypto interest programs remain an alluring proposal, however, and their number is set to multiply over the coming year. As Shapeshift’s Erik Vorhees pointed out, once the inflationary nature of central bank currencies is factored in, crypto interest accounts become significantly more appealing than their fiat counterparts.

When comparing crypto-denominated interest/yield to fiat-denominated yields, remember to subtract 2-3% of the fiat yield due to inflation. Stated differently, compare the real yield of fiat returns to the nominal yield of crypto returns. The delta is what central banks r stealing — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) March 29, 2019

Patrick McDonnell, 46, of New York City, is accused in a wire fraud indictment filed in Brooklyn Federal Court last week, the New York Post reports.

“McDonnell used smoke and mirrors to allegedly dupe investors into paying his company, CabbageTech, for advice and strategies on cryptocurrency trading,” said Postal Inspection Service Agent Philip Bartlett in a news release announcing McDonnell’s arrest.

The 40-minute YouTube video allegedly shows McDonnell in a Guy Fawkes mask -- associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous -- pitching investors as he talks about virtual cash like Bitcoin, the Post reported.

Prosecutors said McDonnell used bogus bank statements to inform investors that their virtual currency investments were doing well, according to the paper.

Last year a judge ordered McDonnell to pay more than $1.1 million in restitution and civil penalties in a crypto fraud lawsuit brought by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Staten Island Advance reported.",,https://www.coindesk.com/irans-crypto-regulations-whats-happening-behind-closed-doors,"Under pressure for being months behind schedule, the Central Bank of Iran finally published a draft framework on the legality of cryptocurrencies in late January and welcomed feedback.

While some see the totality of the framework as a step forward, most members of the burgeoning local crypto community are unhappy with much of the specifics. They feel that the framework could severely restrict people and businesses operating in the fast-growing field if it is implemented in its current form.

Among other things, the framework proposes banning the use of global cryptocurrencies and various tokens as methods of domestic payment; requires cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain permits, therefore opening a new avenue for rent-seeking in a country that has already too much of it; and uses the word “forbidden” a lot, which could entail the threat of criminal prosecution.

So, the local community quickly started working on ways to improve it.

On March 9, more than three dozen members of the community sent their proposals to the central bank in the form of a joint document that found 51 problems in the regulator’s 13-page draft framework.

However, at least for now, there isn’t much else they can do. The fate of their existing businesses, budding ideas and passion for decentralization is mostly in the hands of larger and immensely complicated centralized power structures.

The sanctions question

That this is occurring is because money has transformed into a security issue in Iran.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s government in early April 2018 “unified” the country’s dual foreign exchange rates in a bid to buoy a national currency sharply declining due to fears of returning U.S. sanctions. Within days, the central bank was directed to implement a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies at the behest of the government in a misguided effort to prevent further capital flight.

In early May, President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed “the toughest sanctions ever” against the Islamic Republic. This only exacerbated a currency crisis in Iran and led to the rial hitting several consecutive all-time lows in the ensuing months.

Moreover, dozens of currency traders were arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms and hefty fines while several high-level financial offenders, including a man dubbed the “Sultan of Coins” due to his hoarding of gold coins, were executed.

On the other hand, Iranian authorities see an opportunity in cryptocurrencies due to its potential to challenge exertion of extraterritorial restrictions. Be that as it may, people actually working on ongoing local projects know they can’t – and are not designed to – circumvent sanctions.

Rouhani has personally attended several top-level meetings on cryptocurrencies, the central bank is establishing a sovereign rial-backed cryptocurrency to expand digital banking operations and Iran’s top banks have launched a gold-backed cryptocurrency to sell their bad assets and generate liquidity.

Regulatory challenges

Against this backdrop, any entity that has remotely anything to do with cryptocurrencies – as many as 28 – wants to have a hand in the action. After the central bank, the next major entities include the Securities and Exchange Organization, the High Council of Cyberspace, the Ministry of ICT, the parliament, the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and the Customs Administration.

It is worth noting that those entities belong to different, sometimes rivaling factions and each has their own opinions about how or whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated.

In recent months, there have been talks that the cabinet may have the final say on passing cryptocurrency regulations. If that happens, it could be a simplifying factor in that it could block many of the lower-level entities from trying to have a finger in the pie. But at the same time, it chips away at the central bank’s authority and highlights the independence it so desperately needs.

The fact that so many entities are trying to have a say about cryptocurrency regulations does not negate the central bank’s restrictive capabilities, but it affects its ability to legalize or otherwise support activities in this field, believes Saeed Khoshbakht, CEO of Tehran-based distributed ledger technology solutions firm Areatak.

“In other words, we have one rule: everyone needs to be onboard for something to be implemented, whereas only one needs to be opposed to stop a motion,” Khoshbakht, who acted as an advisor for the central bank-affiliated Informatics Services Corporation concerning the regulatory framework, told CoinDesk.

He thinks Iran’s cryptocurrency community needs to learn to lobby – “in its positive sense” – since it currently has no effective links to any of the deciding entities.

That, he said, could include working toward enacting constructive regulations, alleviating concerns felt by law enforcement and judiciary, and supporting government entities when necessary.

“Ultimately, I believe the central bank is Iran’s best bet for regulating cryptocurrencies,” Khoshbakht said. “If making decisions for this area gets out of the central bank’s hands for any reason, including mistakes on the community’s part, I think the situation could become much more difficult.”

In the state of Florida, there’s an ongoing lawsuit against Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, for billions of dollars. Wright is being sued by the Kleiman family on behalf of the late Dave Kleiman for allegedly misappropriating billions worth of BTC through a partnership years ago. On March 29, the Kleiman vs. Wright discovery meeting transcript was published revealing more interesting details about this unique case.

The Billion Dollar Bitcoin Lawsuit Continues With a Discovery Meeting

According to Ira Kleiman, his brother David’s inheritance was allegedly manipulated during a multi-year partnership with Australian native Craig Wright. On Valentine’s Day last year, a case was filed against Wright in Florida which accused him of defrauding Kleiman out of an assumed 1.1 million BTC stash. The lawsuit has continued into 2019, after Wright’s legal counsel attempted to get the case dismissed only for Florida district Judge Beth Bloom to deny the defendant’s dismissal. This week, on March 29, the court’s discovery meeting transcript was released which explains that Wright and Kleiman’s partnership was very complicated. Wright is scheduled to be deposed under oath by Kleiman’s lawyers on Thursday, April 4.

The discovery meeting reveals some fascinating aspects in regard to one of the most compelling Bitcoin-related lawsuits to date. For instance, during the proceedings, the court asked Wright’s legal counsel whether he did or did not collaborate with Kleiman in the development of Bitcoin. Wright’s attorneys replied by saying: “It is Dr. Wright’s position, your Honor, that Dave Kleiman assisted in editing the protocol related to Bitcoin but did not create Bitcoin.” The judge then asked the defendant’s counsel if Wright and Kleiman jointly mined bitcoin and co-owned any cryptocurrencies. The lawyer detailed that Wright’s position is that he never mined bitcoin with Kleiman nor did any co-owned bitcoin exist. Additionally, Wright’s attorney asserted that Kleiman had no legal rights to intellectual property associated with Bitcoin or the Bitcoin protocol.

Parsing Through Thousands of Documents

The judge and the two disputing parties also discussed Wright’s issues with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), which explained that the ATO was and still might be investigating Wright and Kleiman’s collaboration. The lawyer representing the Kleiman estate stated that the plaintiffs were contacted by the ATO while conducting an investigation to find out whether there was information the Kleimans had for corroborating evidence on the matter. Further, the discovery transcript reveals that the late David Kleiman left a significant trail of documents behind which may pertain to the lawsuit. The two disputing parties are parsing through thousands of documents that belonged to David Kleiman, his brother Ira, and the business W&K Info Defense Research. This includes documents that stem from a number of electronic devices, computers, phones, hard drives, encrypted chats, and emails that belonged to Kleiman.

Kleiman’s Legal Counsel: ‘The Satoshi Nakamoto Story Is Relevant’

Toward the end of the discovery hearing, the parties also discussed the Satoshi Nakamoto moniker and how Wright claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin but failed to provide evidence. Kleiman’s lawyer explained how Andrew O’Hagan, the famous London Review of Books author who wrote an article called “The Satoshi Affair,” had hours of Wright discussing how he invented Bitcoin. The entire story between O’Hagan and Wright makes the plaintiffs believe that Wright came out saying he was Satoshi for “celebrity status” and to “sell his intellectual property that Satoshi Nakamoto created for billions of dollars.” The Kleimans think the Satoshi story is “relevant” to the proceedings and that the late David Kleiman was very much involved in a partnership with Wright involving Bitcoin.

“So the plaintiffs’ position is that admissions with regard to who owned the intellectual property created by Satoshi Nakamoto and the story of Satoshi Nakamoto are relevant to the case because it is plaintiffs’ theory that Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of a partnership between Craig Wright and Dave Kleiman,” explained the Kleiman estate’s lawyer.

In addition to the Wright deposition scheduled for April 4, Ira Kleiman will be deposed as well. After the depositions, the court will reconvene to discuss the matters and come back with any follow up. The judge also gave the plaintiff’s counsel permission to ask Wright about the communications with O’Hagan in order to proportionate the findings. The entire case between Wright and Kleiman goes beyond any scope of all the other high profile BTC cases so far because it involves the creation of Bitcoin itself. Moreover, the lawsuit started many years after Ira Kleiman became his brother’s beneficiary when Dave died from a rough battle with MRSA. The Kleiman vs. Wright case is thought provoking because whatever way it settles, some believe it will either provide answers or even more questions to the Satoshi Nakamoto mystery. So far, Wright has failed to convince the greater Bitcoin community that he is the creator of Bitcoin and has yet to provide any cryptographic evidence.

What Is CyberMiles?

CyberMiles is a Hong Kong-based blockchain platform created by U.S.-based ecommerce marketplace app company 5miles. The company aims to replace legacy ecommerce marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay with a suite of smart contract-based tools. It originated as an Ethereum-based network until the Travis mainnet launched in October 2018. CyberMiles Token (CMT) is the native cryptocurrency coin of the CyberMiles platform.

If you’re not already familiar with 5miles, it has over 15 million users as of the fourth quarter of 2018. It’s a mobile local marketplace app that combines Instagram and Cragslist to provide an alternative to Facebook Marketplace. It received over $62 million in Series A and B funding, with investors including SIG, IDG, and Blue Lake.

Dr. Lucas Lu is the CEO of both 5miles and the CyberMiles Foundation. He holds a PhD in particle physics and worked at CERN and Alibaba before founding these projects. Dr. Lu recruited a highly-educated technical team capable of engineering sleek projects.

Reinventing online commerce sounds great on paper, but it’s not easy to do. There are a ton of P2P marketplaces online these days.

Facebook Marketplace alone has 800 million users posting up to 20 million new items for sale every week. Craigslist posts 80 million new ads every month, and eBay has 1 billion products listed. These are just two of the big names with their hands in the resale market estimated to be worth $41 billion by 2022 (more than double the $20 billion market in 2017).

But the biggest players in ecommerce are Amazon and Alibaba, which earn nearly a combined $1 trillion between them. These ecommerce giants are stifling innovation by choking out smaller competitors. CyberMiles was created to use lessons learned from 5miles to build a blockchain-based ecommerce platform so good even the competition is forced to use it.

And being separate projects doesn’t mean they’ll be starting from scratch – CyberMiles is aggressively marketed to 5miles users to build proof of concept. It’ll need to scale a lot larger to take on its brethren though.

Let’s start our quest to determine they chances of success by researching CMT, the proprietary cryptocurrency utility token used by the CyberMiles platform.

CMT Cryptocurrency Summary

CyberMiles has a total supply of 1,000,000,000 CMT. The peak price of CMT so far was $0.583862 on January 7, 2018.

The CyberMiles ICO token crowdsale was held from September through November 22, 2017. It raised over $30 million worth of Ether. Approximately 42 percent of the total supply (420,000,000 CMT) was sold during the public ICO sale. Of the remaining supply, 20 percent was withheld by the founding team and 10 percent was set aside for community and network development.

During the ICO, CMT was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The CyberMiles Token was migrated through a coin swap to the mainnet on October 15, 2018 at a ratio of 1:1.

CMT is mined using a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm with what correlates to approximately an 8 percent APR on staked coins.

CyberMiles Tokens are accepted on a wide variety of popular cryptocurrency exchange markets, including IDCM, Binance, DragonEX, Huobi, Coineal, Bithumb, Digifinex, and OKEx. Its trading pairs include ETH, BTC, and USDT.

CMT can be stored in the official CyberMiles Mobile Blockchain Wallet for iOS or Android.

Going the Extra CyberMiles

Ecommerce marketplaces like Craigslist, eBay, and Amazon look simplistic because of their intuitive GUIs, but they’re very complicated websites. The CyberMiles Foundation understands these complexities and is building the CyberMiles network with a library of smart contracts meant to handle every aspect of ecommerce.

Middleware amounts to all the backend operations we don’t think about that need to work exactly right for products to be moved to shopping carts, discounts to be applied, memberships tracked, transactions settled, and more.

This modular approach makes it easier for developers to move their existing legacy product onto the blockchain.

It does appear from the whitepaper that CyberMiles is attempting to insert itself as an arbitrator between buyers and sellers. This is similar to how PayPal started, and it’s a good move for the company’s profitability, but it’ll be a hard sell for merchants. Companies like Walmart, Best Buy, Costco, and Amazon have their own return policies and are unlikely to appreciate an additional middle man.

CyberMiles already has several dApps built on its platform, including MetaMask for CMT (a browser-based identity vault), a payment gateway, a security token launchpad, and an OTC exchange with plans to support Gemini’s GUSD and other stablecoins.

The team has an ambitious roadmap for 2019, with plans to upload the entire 5miles user database into the CyberMiles blockchain. I’m not sure how those 15 million users will feel about their personal data being stored on an immutable distributed ledger, but we’ll find that out when it happens.

CybermIles Summary

CyberMiles is a blockchain-based ecommerce platform developed by the same team that developed 5miles. CyberMiles plans to become a go-to payment clearing house for online transactions far beyond the P2P marketplace of its parent company. The success of the project hinges on these key ingredients.

CyberMiles started on the Ethereum blockchain but moved to its own mainnet in October 2018.

CyberMiles Token (CMT) is the native cryptocurrency coin for the CyberMiles network. It’s a utility token used to pay for tokenized transactions and is mined using DPoS.

CyberMiles hopes to overtake ecommerce giants Amazon and Alibaba by giving small businesses a way to securely and efficiently process transactions on the blockchain.

With these pieces in place, CyberMiles is certainly an ambitious project with a highly skilled technical team in place. One can only wonder if that’s enough to compete in one of the biggest (and fastest growing) sectors in modern business.",2019-03-31 14:06:07+00:00,https://www.ccn.com/russian-facebook-vk-wants-to-turn-its-100-million-users-into-crypto-fans/,"

VK - the ""Facebook of Russia"" - plans to launch its own cryptocurrency. | Source: Shutterstock

VKontakte (also known as “VK”), which is Russia’s version of Facebook, is planning to issue its own cryptocurrency. The project is currently under development, but a final decision has not yet been made.

The social media firm wants to create a cryptocurrency that all its users can implement, according to Russian news website RNS.

VKontakte claims it has 97 million active monthly users.

VK Launched Money Transfer System In 2018

If VKontakte is successful in rolling out its own cryptocurrency, users will be able to earn crypto for sharing interesting posts and accumulating “likes.”

They can also use the digital currency to buy and sell goods to each other and to transfer funds using VK Pay. VK Pay is the cashless money transfer system that VKontakte launched in June 2018.

However, it’s unclear how VKontakte’s cryptocurrency would be received in Russia, which has a lukewarm attitude toward virtual currencies.

As CCN.com reported, Russian president Vladimir Putin is a bitcoin skeptic, although he has warmed up to crypto a bit.

CCN: Putin’s Bitcoin Regulation Deadline Might Not Lead to Actual Crypto Rules https://t.co/RajyfdsB1v pic.twitter.com/sCLfrk1TAp — DigitalCashNews (@DigitalCashNews) February 28, 2019

Putin recently set a July 2019 deadline for crypto regulations to be established in Russia. However, it’s questionable whether these rules will be rolled out this year since this initiative was previously delayed.

Last year, Putin set a July 2018 deadline for the implementation of guidelines for bitcoin trading, initial coin offerings, blockchain, and crypto mining. But those regulations never materialized.

Duma Rep: Russia Won’t Adopt Crypto for 30 Years

Moreover, Elina Sidorenko of the State Duma says Russia will probably not adopt cryptocurrencies for at least the next 30 years.

Sidorenko is the chairwoman of an interdepartmental working group of the State Duma for managing the risks of cryptocurrency turnover.

“The Russian Federation — like any other country in the world — is simply not ready to combine its traditional financial system with cryptocurrencies.” “And to say that this idea can be implemented in Russia for at least the next 30 years is unlikely.”

Scandal-Ridden Facebook Wants to Launch its Own Crypto

Facebook sent shock waves through the cryptocurrency industry when a report exposed its ambitious plans to create a proprietary stablecoin that will enable its 2 billion monthly users to transfer value to each other.

Because of the massive size of the global Facebook network, the social media monopoly could actually operate like a small, independent economy.

However, Facebook has been roiled by scandals amid revelations that it has been selling private user data for years — without users’ consent.

As a result, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is considering slapping Facebook with a “record-setting” fine.

Given the uproar over accusations that Facebook has repeatedly violated user privacy, it’s unclear how willing its users are to entrust the platform with their financial data.

Facebook May Be Slapped with ‘Record-Setting’ FTC Fine for Data Breach Scandal https://t.co/CiPrhZHJ3U — CCN – Capital & Celeb News (@CapitalAndCeleb) January 18, 2019

Moreover, a former Harvard classmate of Mark Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has grossly inflated its user statistics and actually has 1 billion fake accounts.

So in addition to violating user privacy, the social media monopoly has committed mass fraud, according to his bombshell allegation.

“If, as we allege, Facebook is lying about its fake accounts, that means that it could be liable to its advertising customers for billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains — over and above what advertisers have already sued over.”",2019-03-31 21:45:56+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/police-freeze-bank-accounts-seize-luxury-cars-in-probe-of-22-million-ico-promoter-vanbex,"Canadian police have frozen assets owned by the founders of blockchain services company Vanbex, as part of a fraud investigation into a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) that raised $22 million.

According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, the company, led by Kevin Hobbs and Lisa Cheng, raised $30 million CAD (about $22 million) worth of fiat and cryptocurrency through the sale of a token called FUEL.

Vanbex told investors that the token would be usable in a forthcoming smart contract system called Etherparty, and that “the value of the FUEL token would increase dramatically,” says the civil forfeiture action filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

However, Vanbex “developed no usable products” and Hobbs and Cheng “did not intend to develop the products they were marketing but rather [acted] with [the] intention to misappropriate the corporately invested funds raised for their own personal benefit,” according to a filing by the director of civil forfeiture at Canada’s Ministry of Attorney General.

“FUEL tokens became virtually worthless in dollar value while not being capable of use in the non-existent smart contracts system or for any product or service other than a cryptocurrency coin creating service called Rocket,” which was different than what the purchasers were promised, the director claimed.

No criminal charges have been filed so far, and when reached by CoinDesk on Sunday evening, Cheng and Hobbs denied the fraud charges and said Vanbex is cooperating with the investigation.

But in response to the government’s application, Justice J.A. Power on March 14 authorized the government to seize the founders’ two Land Rovers; ordered Bank of Montreal to freeze Hobbs’ two accounts there containing slightly less than $1 million; and ordered him and Cheng not to sell, borrow against or damage their Vancouver condominium for at least 30 days, court papers show.

Vanbex’s response

In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Hobbs and Cheng called the fraud allegations “false,” and said that the investigations were the result of “false claims by a former contractor.”

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) began investigating Vanbex and its founders for fraud in May 2018 and the Canadian Revenue Agency subsequently began a tax probe, according to the filing.

The founders denied that they made any promises about the value of FUEL tokens, saying “the tokens integrate bitcoin and Ethereum and the value of any currency is beyond any company or individual’s control, obviously. … Fuel tokens pay for transaction fees on the network for Smart Contracts deployed through our architecture.”

Vanbex’s business accounts have not been frozen, they added.

They took issue with the government’s characterization of Vanbex in court papers as a shell company. “Vanbex is an operating company, which is easy to establish,” they said, adding that they have been in the crypto space since 2013.

Further, Hobbs and Cheng took issue with the authorities’ claim that Vanbex produced no usable products. “We have had more than 50 clients” – not two, as the court documents allege – “and we have two excellent products.”

‘High roller’

Still, the court papers go on to allege that Hobbs and Cheng “acquired sudden and substantial personal wealth” around the time of the ICO, purchasing two condominiums – the one in Vancouver, another in Toronto – for about $3 million each and the two Land Rovers, and leasing a Lamborghini worth $375,000 for a three-year term.

Further, Hobbs spent some of the misappropriated funds on gambling “domestically and internationally at the high roller level,” according to one of the filings.

From September 2016 to March 2018, he withdrew a total of $1.3 million from casinos in British Columbia, one document alleges. In November 2017, the state-owned British Columbia Lottery Corporation put Hobbs on a “watch list,” preventing him from buying in at any of its casinos without proof of the source of his funds.

When Hobbs and Cheng became aware of the investigation, they started attempting to liquidate their assets, taking out mortgages against the condos and putting one of them up for sale, the document claims.

Addressing this, Cheng and Hobbs told CoinDesk they borrowed the money to inject into the business.

Regarding the gambling, they told CoinDesk that Hobbs “has been a professional poker player in the past and has participated in poker tournaments around the world,” and “has never been prevented from [playing at] any casino.”

The court papers also note that Hobbs has a criminal record in Canada. He was convicted of possessing criminally obtained property and money laundering in 2008, for which was sentenced to nine months, and growing and trafficking in marijuana in 2009, for which he was sentenced to 30 months, the documents say.

In addition, he was busted for possession of pot in New York in 2005, for which he was given a one-year sentence, the Canadian government said.

Cooperation ongoing

Employees have been “encouraged to cooperate fully with the investigation and they are,” Hobbs and Cheng told CoinDesk.

“We remain confident that the truth will prevail, and this will be behind us soon,” they said.

“Unfortunately, these things move at a pace beyond our control. In the meantime, we will continue to innovate and deliver quality products. Our counsel are working to put this astern in a fashion that decisively confirms our leading role in this industry, which we intend to maintain.”

They concluded by telling stakeholders:

“Thank you for your loyalty and trust. It is not misplaced.”

Interestingly, however, bitcoin is among the least significant price gainers so far this year while still flashing a noteworthy Q1 increase of 10 percent. What this means is that a sizable portion of the market’s recent growth came from the many other cryptocurrencies trading on exchanges today.

In fact, data from analytics provider Messari reveals that 118 cryptos increased more in price on a year-to-date basis than bitcoin, with several boasting triple-digit percent increases during that period.

As a result, the total network value of all cryptocurrencies – excluding bitcoin – came within 1 percent of suprassing that of bitcoin’s in March.

With Q1 of 2019 now in the history books, let’s dive into some of the more notable individual performances by way of breaking down their respective asset size classes and market sectors.

Performances by asset size

There is a wide spectrum of assets, in the cryptocurrency market. These range from some of the biggest, like ethereum (close to $15 billion), to the smallest, like dancoin (DAN), which is worth just over $3 million. Hundreds of networks fall in between.

The table below depicts how Messari segments crypto-asset sizes into the four groups (large cap, medium cap, small cap and micro cap), as well their respective best and worst performers for the Q1 period.

While the highest-ranked cryptocurrencies in terms of asset size tend to be the most well-known coins in the industry (they trade with the most volume), data shows they are not always the strongest performers.

As can be seen, the top performers in both the medium and small-cap segments saw significantly better Q1 performances than the leader of the large-cap segment, binance coin (BNB), the price of which nearly tripled during that period.

Ravencoin’s (RVN) performance surpassed all other medium cap cryptos, boasting a 386 percent increase in Q1, almost all of which was achieved in the month of March when its price jumped from the monthly open of $0.013 to its close of $0.061, according to data from Binance.

Pchain (PAI) was the best performer in the small-cap segment as well as the single strongest performer in the entire cryptocurrency market. PAI recorded a Q1 price increase of roughly 781 percent, Messari data reveals.

While many cryptocurrencies boasted double and even triple-digit gains in Q1, not all outperformed bitcoin or even finished the quarter with gains.

Bitcoin SV’s (BSV) 26 percent loss and NEM’s (XEM) 13 percent loss was enough to establish them as the worst performers in the large and medium cap segments, respectively, while the worst performer of the broader market was the small-cap crypto Grin (GRIN), which lost 70 percent of its value since its main-net launch on January 15.

It should be noted that market cap as a metric for valuing crypto-assets does have limitations not observed when used in traditional finance for valuing a publicly traded company. For example, lost bitcoins are technically accounted for in bitcoin’s market capitalization, even though they are no longer part of the “circulating” supply and can never be spent.

This is not an issue when determining the market cap of a company since only outstanding and liquid shares are taken into account, leading cryptocurrency researchers to come up with alternative network valuation models like “realized cap“, first proposed by Coinmetrics in 2018, that aims to account for such limitations.

Performances by sector

Another way to segment the cryptocurrency market is by sector, which describes the key parts of the crypto-economy.

Messari provides a number of different market sector classifications, the Q1 average and median performance of which are shown in the table below, and were calculated by taking the performance of the top 5 coins by market cap in each sector into account.

As can be seen, the “Miscellaneous” sector was the best performing sector in Q1 on average, but this was largely due to the fact the best and near 800 percent quarterly gainer Pchain (PAI) is included in the category.

Since PAI’s growth significantly skews the average performance of the sector, the median which describes the true middle value of a given sector’s quarterly performances, perhaps most honestly describes the sector with a more modest 52 percent median price increase.

The strongest sector in terms of median performance in Q1 were the coins intended to act as bridges between cryptocurrencies, making those networks interoperable. That list is comprised of names like Ontology (ONT), Chainlink (LINK) and Aion (AION). The sector finished Q1 with a 78 percent increase as the median performance.

In all, the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap in each sector averaged no worse than a 20 percent price increase.

Emergence above a key moving average

It’s one accomplishment to have a strong quarter. It’s another feat entirely for an asset to trade above its 200-day moving average.

Generally regarded to as the dividing line between a strong market and one that is not, the 200-day moving average is a technical hurdle that several top-ranked cryptocurrencies were able to climb above for the first time this quarter in nearly a year.

The last time CoinDesk conducted the same analysis on March 13, just four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies had both of its BTC and USD pairs trading above the 200 day moving average as signs of life in the market were just beginning to re-emerge.

Since then, however, four more cryptocurrencies joined the list, including Ontology (ONT), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA), and EOS (EOS) all of which now are trading with both pairs above the moving average. This indicates that a shift from bearish to bullish trends is on the rise.

Still lagging behind with neither trading pair above the MA are the first and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP), as well as six others (not including USDT and Bitcoin SV, the latter of which has less than 200 days of trading history).

Renewed optimism

Indeed, Q1 was an impressive stretch for the cryptocurrency market, which has seemingly renewed optimism among some of its market participants.

On March 22, CoinDesk Markets conducted a Twitter poll to gauge the public’s longer term outlook on the market leader bitcoin by asking what price it will trade closest to on the date of its next supply production halving event in May of 2020.

On the day of #bitcoin's next halving, what will its price be closest to? The next halving is anticipated to occur in May of 2020. — CoinDesk Markets (@CoinDeskMarkets) March 22, 2019

Interestingly, the most popular option was a value closest to $15,000, accumulating 47 percent of the 6,450 votes.

Currently priced around $4,000, that would mean the majority of those polled believe bitcoin will increase at least 275 percent or nearly quadruple its value in less than 14 months.

Floating balloons image via Shutterstock",2019-04-01 22:45:05+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-brief-history-of-the-secs-reviews-of-bitcoin-etf-proposals,"It may span only a couple of years, but the history of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is already a long one. Back in March 2017, the SEC rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF put forward by the Winklevoss twins, claiming that the underlying Bitcoin market was still too manipulable, volatile and resistant to surveillance. Fast forward to March 2019 and the SEC has still yet to approve a single Bitcoin ETF, with the comments to its latest public consultation remaining largely negative.

Such an absence of major progress may seem fatally discouraging to casual observers hoping for an ETF to provide crypto with added legitimacy. Nonetheless, the intervening period between March 2017 and the present day has witnessed a softening of the SEC's stance, with members of the commission even going so far as declaring that they expect a Bitcoin ETF to be approved sooner or later. There is, then, plenty of reason to draw hope from the SEC's recent dealings with Bitcoin ETF applicants, even if the longer-term history shows that the commission hasn't always adopted a favorable stance toward crypto.

2017: SEC claims manipulability, volatility and absence of surveillance

On June 30, 2016, the Bats BZX Exchange filed a proposed rule change with the SEC, which would have permitted it to list and trade shares of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the Winklevoss' ETF would have been the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund licensed to appear on a fully regulated stock exchange, thereby making it possible for the layperson to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to actually own the cryptocurrency or wrestle with crypto exchanges or wallets.

No doubt this would have represented a big step toward the mainstream for crypto, yet after a long period of deliberation and consultation, the SEC rejected the proposed rule change. On March 10, 2017, it released a statement explaining the reasoning behind its decision, with the difficulty of preventing manipulation and fraud being at the top of its list.

""Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, as the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all previously approved commodity-trust ETPs agreements that help address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market — the Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.""

Barely two weeks after this judgment had been published, the SEC denied a similar proposal submitted by NYSE Arca, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange and which wanted to list the SolidX Bitcoin Trust ETF. Reusing many of the same phrases and declarations, the commission wrote on March 28 that ""it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""

As the two episodes above imply, 2017 wasn't a particularly great year for Bitcoin ETFs or for the notion that the SEC might be inclined to license one of them — because, aside from SolidX and Winklevoss, an ETF from Barry Silbert's Grayscale Investments was registered with the the SEC in January 2017, and it fared no better than its rivals. It was subject to a delay on March 22, after it had received three comments — all negative — from members of the public, and then in September of the same year, it withdrew its application, citing a lack of ""regulatory developments"" in the crypto market as the main reason for this action.

Between March and September, the public sent the SEC additional comments as part of the consultation, and while they ended up numbering only 21 in total, a portion of them provide insight into why Grayscale Investments wasn't likely to gain approval for its ETF at that time.

For example, a seven-page letter from Mark T. Williams, a finance professor at Boston University, details a long list of reasons as to why a Bitcoin ETF — particularly from Grayscale Investments — wasn't appropriate. These include Bitcoin market flaws, such as ""poor price discovery, irregular trade execution, shallow trade volume, hoarding, relatively low liquidity, hyperprice volatility, a global web of unregulated bucket-shop exchanges, high bankruptcy risk and oversized exposure to trading and price discovery in countries outside the jurisdiction of the SEC."" Yet, Williams also noted that Digital Currency Group — which owns Grayscale Investments and Coindesk (among other ventures) — ""is fraught with inherent conflicts of interest.""

But while this would suggest that there was some strong opposition to this particular ETF, other researchers outside the cryptocurrency industry were more positive. ""Moving bitcoin trading activity to regulated US exchanges will improve price discovery and reduce the potential for manipulation and money laundering,"" argued James J. Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University.

Likewise, professor Campbell R. Harvey of Duke University (and colleagues) wrote that ""allowing the Bitcoin Investment Trust to list its shares on the NYSE Arca as a bona fide Exchange-Traded Product (‘ETP’) would demonstrate the Commission’s utmost commitment to achieving"" its aims of protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets and aiding capital formation. Given that six other economists from six other American universities signed this statement, it revealed that there was actually considerable support for the idea of a Bitcoin ETF, even if the SEC couldn't be disabused of its view that the cryptocurrency market was still too anarchic for it to approve such a fund.

2018: Growing support from the wider industry

As 2017 came to close, there was then a very real sense that the SEC viewed the Bitcoin market with suspicion, and that its sceptical views on the market were reinforced by a significant chunk of the comments it had received from people outside of the crypto industry. However, this unfavorable situation began to change gradually over the course of 2018, because, even though the SEC continued to reject Bitcoin ETFs, dissenting voices from within the commission began emerging.

This was most in evidence in July, when the SEC rejected — for a second time — the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust proposed for listing by the Bats BZX Exchange. Once again, it judged that Bats' proposal failed to demonstrate that it was consistent with rules ""designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices."" However, it took the unusual step of adding a disclaimer to this rejection, writing, ""Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.""

Even more significantly, Hester Peirce (now dubbed “Bitcoin Mom” by the community) dissented from this decision, despite being a commissioner at the SEC. On July 27, she wrote:

""The disapproval order focuses on the characteristics of the spot market for bitcoin, rather than on the ability of BZX — pursuant to its own rules — to surveil trading of and to deter manipulation in the ETP shares listed and traded on BZX.""

This open dissent from an SEC commissioner indicated a subtle turning of the tide in favor of Bitcoin ETFs. And while one of the comments submitted during the brief SEC consultation in May was trenchantly hostile to the Winklevoss ETF, most were supportive. More importantly, the supportive letters and comments didn't always come from people working directly within the crypto industry, with four companies operating within the global exchange-traded products market providing key testimony in favor.

For example, C&C Trading concluded in its comment that it ""supports listing the COIN ETF and believes it will be an innovative product for investors and market professionals to trade,"" with the ETF market-making specialist also adding that many existing ETFs ""are based on opaque and illiquid underlying instruments.""

Still, despite the fact that wider industry and public opinion was in general warming to the idea of Bitcoin ETFs, 2018 unsurprisingly set the record for the number of proposals dismissed by the SEC. On Aug. 22 alone, the commission rejected nine applications, with the likes of Direxion, ProShares and GraniteShares having their applications turned down (and in some cases, more than one application). And once again, the SEC explained these rejections mostly in terms of a failure to prove that the applicants' rules were ""designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.""

The fact that the commission remained fixed to this point of view shouldn't be surprising, not least because this decision followed soon after the publication of fairly damning research into crypto-market manipulation. In June, University of Texas researchers released a paper concluding that Tether and Bitfinex manipulation was responsible for around 50 percent of Bitcoin's price rises in 2017. Barely a month before, the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into Bitcoin price manipulation, while, at the beginning of August, the Wall Street Journal published a study that found that price manipulation was mostly being perpetrated by “trading groups” using Telegram and other messaging services.

2019: Increased hope despite decreased momentum

In light of all this negative publicity, it's unsurprising that the SEC continues to refuse the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. And while nothing has essentially changed in 2019 (and no ETF has so far been approved), there is once again increased cause for hope.

In February, Robert J. Jackson Jr. – a commissioner with the SEC – went on record as saying that he expects the commission to license a Bitcoin ETF sooner or later.

“Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards we’ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.”

That same month, a commissioner with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) criticized the SEC for having rejected previous ETFs on the grounds of potential price manipulation. Speaking at the BiPartisan Policy Center in Washington D.C., Brian Quintenz said:

""There are mathematical ways through a settlement index to design a contract where even if there isn’t a lot of liquidity on one exchange referenced, the index itself is not readily susceptible to manipulation.""

Added to Hester Peirce's continued support for the crypto industry, such remarks indicate a climate in which the SEC is becoming incrementally more receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin ETF, despite Peirce’s warning in December 2018 that an approval could take longer than some people would hope.

Indeed, an approval could take some time, since the prognoses for the ETFs currently under review don't look especially encouraging. In February, Reality Shares withdrew its own ETF trust after the SEC had encouraged it to do so, largely because the ETF took the unusual step of combining Bitcoin futures, sovereign debt instruments and money market mutual funds into a single derivative. And while there has been some hope in the Chicago Board Options Exchange's (CBOE) reapplication for a Bitcoin ETF, this has been dampened by the public's largely negative response to the application.

Of the 18 comments submitted to date (between Feb. 13 and March 31), only three were in favor of the ETF. However, it would be extremely rash to conclude on the basis of 15 disapproving comments that the general public or the wider financial industry are growing increasingly weary of the idea of a Bitcoin ETF. That's because some of these comments lack any real credibility, being either extremely minimal at best (e.g., here, here and here) or downright incoherent at worst (e.g., here, here and here). As for the other, even though they generally argue their points with more depth and rigor, they're all from repeat commentators.

The two contributions of a one “Sam Ahn” are his eighth and ninth, for instance, while ""investment professional"" Jonathan Harris has sent at least two very similar letters containing general Bitcoin-scepticism, as well as one from April 2017.

This reappearance of entrenched critics undermines any suspicion that opposition to a Bitcoin ETF somehow might be growing. However, by much the same token, it's discouraging to note that there aren't really any significant contributions to the consultation on CBOE's latest application. While it's hard to conclude anything on the basis of a single proposal, this might indicate that the push for an ETF is losing some momentum — or, at least, publicity. At the very least, interest from the wider public and from industries outside of crypto may be waning, even though the cryptocurrency industry remains firmly behind the idea.

And even if interest is waning, this is likely due to a recognition that it isn't letters from the public that will now sway the SEC, but actual evolution in the maturation and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. And because there have been multiple developments on this front — from the United States to Russia and Japan — it's likely only a matter of time before the SEC approves its first Bitcoin ETF.",,https://www.ccn.com/5-facebook-challengers-that-pay-you-crypto-for-quality-content/,"

Here's a quick overview of blockchain-centric social media sites that enable anyone to earn crypto. Image from Shutterstock.

Facebook and Twitter earn billions from your participation. But did you know there are sites where you can earn cryptocurrency by blogging and creating content? You’ve likely heard of Steem, but for those who haven’t, let’s talk about that first.

Steem

Steem is a decentralized blockchain project built on the same technology as EOS. SteemIt is the official front-end for the Steem blockchain, but there are others. Steem enables the creation of uncensorable content, although any platform which displays Steem content can censor aspects of it. Steem users earn money when their content gets upvoted or shared via “resteeming.” Some people earn thousands or more per month in just this way.

Participation in the network generally earns money, and there are various additional ways of obtaining money and influence on the system, such as “Steem Power” and Steem Dollars. Some alternative versions of Steemit exist, like Busy.org, which has a more modernized interface. Then there are projects devoted to hosting more than just text, like D.tube, which is a decentralized version of YouTube built on the Steem blockchain.

Steem built a blockchain from the ground up to pursue its idea of a monetized social network, and so far it’s probably one of the most successful blockchain-enabled social networking platforms. Unlike Minds.com, it’s more about creating content and getting rewarded with fungible money. Minds.com is about creating popular content but the Minds token is not as liquid, nor intended as a financial incentive in the same way. Rather, Minds tokens entitle one to guaranteed views on the growing network.

Yours.org

After leaving Reddit, blockchain developer Ryan X. Charles spent some time finding his way. With the advent of Bitcoin Cash, he created Yours.org. While not a Facebook alternative in the sense that Minds.com is, Yours allows people to earn money by creating quality content.

Forever on the side of bigger blocks, when the Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin SV split took place, Charles sided with Bitcoin SV and converted Yours.org to that cryptocurrency.

Honest.cash

In response to Yours.org switching to Bitcoin SV, a new Bitcoin Cash version of the same idea emerged in the form of Honest.cash. Honest.cash functions in much the same way as Yours.org: when you (pay to) upvote a post, you earn when someone else does so after you. With each successive upvote, the creator splits his earnings with those who upvote the content. The idea is that curating content is almost as valuable as creating it. Honest.cash also allows you to “make your content uncensorable” by embedding it into the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

Cent.co

In the Ethereum ecosystem, the most promising version of this idea of monetized content is Cent.co. Still in beta, Cent has a growing userbase. Cent has income supplementation as one of its goals. They write in their manifesto:

Cent is built to help ease our transition into this less-employed future. It’s designed to become a core layer of the future creative economy — one that directly monetizes the creative- and perspective- based value that single individuals provide.

Content curation is rewarded on Cent in a slightly different way from Honest.cash or Yours.org: you “seed” a post and earn as it becomes more popular.

EOS Options

Similar to most types of decentralized applications, EOS also has social networks. A total of three are quickly found when doing any research, although I haven’t used any of them. One is called Karma, a social network which encourages people to perform good deeds. Another is called Ono, which launched last year.

Perhaps the most similar to Steem and Yours.org is Murmur, which has a tradeable token that is used to tip and reward users for contributing good content.

The idea behind all of these sites is simple enough: the past era of social media enabled centralized networks like Facebook and Twitter to earn billions of dollars from user-generated content.

Why not use the power of the blockchain to share this value among the users themselves?

At what point do Facebook and Twitter’s influence in our institutions and the grand absurdity of their success make an alternative more attractive?

Cent believes that point is when people need another source of income due to automation, while Honest.cash, Steem, and Yours.org merely think content creators deserve to earn something for their efforts. The attention economy is still nascent, but the monetary value of people’s attention has long existed in the form of marketing.",2019-04-01 23:30:19+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-01/bitcoin-climbs-to-highest-level-this-year-as-volatility-recedes,"Why did this happen?

How Do Traditional Brokers Compare to Bitcoin OTC-Based Solutions

With the crypto industry growing by leaps and bounds with each passing day, this burgeoning domain has seen the entry of many established financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase and Swissquote over the past year or so.

However, what has come as a bit of a surprise for many is the fact that a lot of traditional banks are also now starting to offer cryptocurrency products to their clients. For example, Goldman Sachs’ recently purchased major crypto exchange Poloniex in an effort to gain a foothold within this ever-evolving market. Similarly, banks like Fisco and Skandiabanken are reportedly in the process of creating new products linked directly to the crypto domain.

With all of this information out there, it is worth asking oneself the question

“So what exactly is the difference between brokerage-managed trading and exchange-based trading (of cryptocurrencies)?”.

Let’s Start With the Bitcoin OTC Basics

First and foremost, we need to understand that a crypto broker is basically an agent/ firm that “handles the trading and management of a client’s crypto assets”. However, when looking at exchange-traded funds, brokers can be found to engage in high-value financial trades without having to consult with their clients first (this, however, is not always the case).

Another key facet worth looking at is the fee structure associated with brokers. When taking into consideration a traditional exchange situation, an individual is required to pay both the network fee as well as a commission for each individual “buy and sell order” that is executed. Additionally, when dealing with crypto-fiat trades usually a high fee is incurred by the account holder — sometimes as large as 15%.

Alternatively, when working with a broker, a trader has the ability to pay him/her directly for a single fee — which is quite an advantage, to say the least.

Other Key Points to Bear in Mind

One of the biggest upsides of using a brokerage service is that it is able to provide users with better limit maintenance tools.

A broker also allows traders to “weigh market conditions” in a much better and calculated fashion.

Brokers provide better spreads on orders when compared to exchanges.

Regulated brokers are able to deliver their clients with a guaranteed level of custodial protection on all managed assets.

All You Need to Know About Bitcoin Brokers

If you're one of those out there that have decided that you want to make a jump into the world of Bitcoin investment and do so with a really large jump, the first piece of advice that's necessary is to not go off just your own thinking.

When it comes to substantial amounts of money and investment, getting an experienced mind on the side can spell the difference between Profits and Misery. By this, I am of course referring to the use of a broker; their extensive degrees of experience can allow you as an investor to make very well thought out investments and turn a more effective profit than just going alone.

Throughout this guide, you'll be shown a range of bitcoin/cryptocurrency brokers that are in operation, along with all the essential information that comes with it. These will allow. you to narrow down a list of potential broker candidates, depending on your individual needs and the kind of investments you'd want to make.

Bitcoin Brokers – The Top Contenders

1 – Circle Trade

Based out of Boston, Massachusetts, and established as a corporation in 2013, Circle Trade is one of the leaders in the international marketplace of Over The Counter Trading of Digital Assets.

While it has been a major contender in the world of OTC trading, Circle Trade also provides users with a range of retail and investor solutions, thanks to its Circle Invest Business including providing payment solutions for the same thanks to its business called Circle Pay.

Fees – Its brokerage fees are also included in its previous agreed fees and prices.

Along with its range of business, investor and OTC trading solutions, Circle Trade also provides auxiliary services such as business advisory, research solutions, including payments, retail, investment, and offering solutions.

Regulated – Yes

2 – ItBit

Founded as a corporation back in 2012, the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange and made its grand launch a year later, the exchange provides its customers with an expansive range of digital assets through it's Over The Counter crypto trading services.

Unlike other exchanges, ItBit has its sights set on a higher net stratum of a customer, doing business with high-value individuals including businesses that also want to make higher scale transactions of up to 100 Bitcoin. One of the ways that it ensures its ongoing profitability through charging its investors a flat fee of 0.1 percent each transaction that takes place on it's Over The Counter platform, along with providing a high level of efficiency; enabling same-day transaction settlements for its consumers.

ItBit is a highly internationally pronounced company, with customers based in over 100 different countries, and operates as one of the very few bitcoin exchanges that have full-fledged regulation and licensing to do business within the state of New York.

3 – Genesis Trading

Operating as one of the few digital asset exchanges that boast a full regulatory authorization from the state of New York, Genesis Global Trading offers investors a meticulous two-sided liquidity market for a wide range of digital currencies which are traded on a daily basis.

Initially, Genesis had been a part of the Trading Division for SecondMarket, which was a company originally owned by the venture capital company – Digital Currency Group. Genesis has broken off from SecondMarket and has offered its version of Bitcoin Brokering since 2013, and this makes it one of the longest-running Over The Counter trading platforms in the marketplace.

Thanks, in large part to being owned by the DCG, it holds a strong reputation among the Bitcoin Brokers. Along with its own brokering services, it allows its customer's preferable access to GreyScale Investment Trusts including Digital Asset Lending.

4 – Jump Trading

While it was registered and incorporated back in 1999, the Jump Trading platform was one of the newer entrants into the world of digital asset trading, especially Over The Counter trading.

What sets the platform apart is the fact that it has since developed and implemented a dashboard which offers customers, investors, and traders to interact in a more efficient way with the OTC desk of Jump Trading.

Why is unique is because this is done through a far more secure means of connection, and removes any reliance upon a third party messaging service, providing far more confidentiality for traders.

As of the writing of this report, the Chicago based company participates in the transaction of over $2 billion in digital assets on a monthly basis.

Along with operating as an Over the Counter digital exchange for investors and traders, Jump Trading also operates as an advisory body for other companies and investors.

5 – Cumberland Mining

Operating as a subsidiary of the larger DRW Holdings LLC, this Chicago based company operates as a Bitcoin brokerage service for its customers.

Much like some of it's Over The Counter counterparts, it provides its investors with a system of two-way liquidity within Bitcoin as well as other highly traded digital assets through its marketplace, specifically targetting individual investors and enterprises which make up the high net-worth stratum.

It manages to obtain a good degree of profitability by charging its lower rate transaction fee on each trade successfully completed within the platform. Cumberland Mining also provides an effective service as an advisory body too and was incorporated back in 1992 before moving into the world of cryptocurrencies in 2012.

6 – Kraken OTC Services

Officially incorporated back in 2012, the San Francisco based digital asset exchange Kraken has gained a strong reputation amongst seasoned cryptocurrency investors of all scales over the past decade.

In 2018, the Kraken team officially announced its intention of launching an Over The Counter trading service in order to provide a more stringent service for a more professional clientele, allowing them to purchase a range of digital assets through a range of off-exchange transactions.

Along with its OTC and crypto exchange services, Kraken's OTC service includes a wide range of additional services for its customers, including meticulous market analysis, fully customized 1 to 1 service, complete asset support as well as a 24-hour international coverage of crypto assets and investor services.

The Kraken OTC, much like a number of others on this list, is set upon providing this service for those interested in conducting larger scale transactions, with its minimum transaction sizes being $100,000, with its brokerage fee being included in the price agreed to by both buyer and seller.

6 – Octagon Strategy

Based in a great place for commerce in South East Asia, specifically Hong Kong. Octagon Strategy operates as an Over The Counter service broker and headed up by the former head of the department of Electronic Trading for the multinational financial institution – Morgan Stanley.

The aforementioned Wayne Trench has argued that Octagon has gained status as Asia's largest digital asset broker. While the minimum trading size is $100,000, there is no maximum, and fees are subject to request upon the completion of any transaction within the platform.

7 – BitStocks

Officially launched back in 2016, the London based company BitStocks seeks to provide its consumer base of higher net worth investors, companies and individuals a great degree of liquidity within the Bitcoin market.

In order to trade on this OTC brokerage service, the company requires any investors to make a minimum deposit of $6,500, which is roughly £5,000 and offers both its OTC services, along with an advisory service for those seeking it.

In contrast with other platforms in the OTC market, where BitStocks turns its profits is from the commission in the execution price of every transaction on the system, which makes it quite similar to Genesis Global Trading in the way it handles commissions.

One of the other ways in which it is able to draw in a profit is through performance fees attached to any investments that appreciate over time. For those interested in benefitting from BitStocks' advisory service, you'll likely incur this fee, which is 25 percent of however much your investment/s are.

Looking at the Market – Over The Counter Bitcoin Trade

Some of the dramatic shifts in the world of cryptocurrencies made a good number of crypto investors question just what kind of proportion of crypto is being traded on exchanges relative to Over The Counter.

Since these fluctuations, Vinny Lingham, one of the more outspoken entrepreneurs in the crypto space has made his opinions clear about this ratio of OTC:Exchanges:

“The OTC market for Bitcoin is bigger than the exchange market. Exchanges set the price but large trades don’t happen there.”

When it comes to the major investors in the world of Bitcoin, I.E. those involved in the trade of anywhere from $500,000 to millions of dollars worth of BTC have a greater preference for using Over The Counter trade rather than having to jump between various exchanges, all while having to address price fluctuations throughout.

One of the reasons for this is that despite its high desirability from its community, Bitcoin has a serious problem with liquidity, in that it lacks a fundamental level of it. This is in contrast to the kind of residual liquidity of blue chips including government bonds.

With OTC brokers, their values tend to be more stable, in that they are always better than the average price you would likely obtain through buying and selling BTC on exchanges independently.

As a result, if you're looking to make a significant investment in the world of BTC, or want to work on a continued frame of buying in and out of the digital currency in higher volumes than usual and capitalize on short term price fluctuations, it's far better to do this through the use of a Bitcoin Broker via an Over The Counter Service.

The OTC Market – its Growth

Over the last few years, the financial scope of Bitcoin OTC trade has exploded. With the likes of brokers like Circle Trade being responsible for the processing of approximately $2 billion worth of various digital assets on a monthly basis. And this is just one of the many exchanges out there involved in such a high monthly volume of digital asset transactions.

As an increasing number of institutional investors gain interest and begin to step into the world of digital asset trading, this initial number of Over The Counter trading companies will increase exponentially.

In addition, to this, as the more centralized exchanges find themselves continually susceptible to hacks of various severities, professional investors will turn more and more away from them wholesale, and make use of OTC systems and Bitcoin brokers in order to make sure that their digital assets are safely secured so as to make them impossible to lose against cybercrime.

Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the digital asset marketplace, Binance agreed with the perspective, and gave his opinion during an interview with the CNBC news team, arguing that: “What I have heard is that the Bitcoin OTC market is at . least as large as the live recorded volumes that we see.”

This presents the suggestion that Bitcoin Trading volumes are, in some sort of way, being underrepresented by analytics platforms. Meaning that they may be worth double that what can be witnessed by the likes of CoinMarketCap.com.

So what is this absolute figure of Monthly trading volumes of Bitcoin within the OTC marketplace? It is really impossible to know this with absolute certainty. But, if we can conceivably conclude that what the likes of Zhao are saying is, in fact, true, then on-exchange trading services and their corresponding volumes may very well mean that the estimate is that $250 billion in BTC is being traded on a monthly basis via Over The Counter services.

So, Which is the Best Broker for you?

There are a couple of elements that you need to pay attention to and seriously consider when looking for your ideal Bitcoin Broker. These are:

Its Reputation among the community:

This is one of the single most important elements that you should consider. If you are going to go ahead with using one brokerage, and entrust them with however much of your money in order to invest in digital assets, then you need to have a level of confidence and trust in that relationship that merits that level of investment.

One of the best first steps to take is to check whether or not this Crypto broker is regulated within the region that they operate, this can be the difference between a green and a red flag right there.

The second step is to assess the reputation of that same broker through crypto investors and companies that do business with it on a regular basis. This can tell you a lot about a company, from who owns them, where they operate, as well as checking out some of the more unbiased reviews about them online.

It's important to point out that not all OTC bitcoin brokerage services out there . will be able to obtain through regulation, this is largely down to the fact that Bitcoin itself doesn't have good enough recognition in some of the countries where these OTC services are located.

With that in mind, making sure that this very same broker still has a good public reputation with its customers and institutional investors.

What Fees They Have:

This element matters as much as the kind of reputation that a broker carries. Whenever you see a broker, they will carry and subsequently a charge, the objective here is finding one whose merit matches up to the commission fees that they charge.

This is especially true if you're looking to be an active trader because if you're dealing with the wrong kind of broker, any profits you'd hope for will be gone before you know it.

Compatibility – Time Zones:

Another attribute that you need to consider is the kind of time zone that there are between you and your potential bitcoin broker, and this can be the difference between trading during their normal business hours, of having to navigate a perilous path of trading between time zones.

As a result, if you're based in one place in the world, pay close attention to where the broker is operating, and have an immediate preference for those that operate in the same country, or at least the same region of the world as you, this can save you a lot of pain in the future.

With that said, however, if you plan to trade a lot, then you may want to consider setting up with more than one, so you can obtain access to multiple markets, and operate at the level that you want to.

A Demonstrably Great Customer Service Record:

Last, but certainly, not least is the fact that your broker should be able to provide a good history of customer service, otherwise you are going to have a miserable start to your investment life. It's never a good sign when you have a broker with an absolutely poor record of dealing with customers, and even if it's just a poor response time to emails, this is not a good sign: It's your money that is riding on how quickly they can respond to that email.

Find out what kind of record they have towards customer service through looking through customer reviews, specifically those that provide as objective a viewpoint as possible in this situation.

Final Thoughts

Despite the fact that the number of cryptocurrency brokerage firms in existence right now are quite few in number, the ones in operation do offer investors with the option to manage their alt-asset portfolios in a highly seamless manner.

With that being said, there are certain downsides associated with using brokerage options as well, these include

(i) They take away a lot of control from the hands of investors since, more often than not, they get to decide how an investors’ coins and tokens are stored.

(ii) A brokered portfolio is quite limited in the sense that its offerings are solely limited to the products being provided by the broker at any given time.

If you are one of those people that is looking to dive deep into the world of longer-term investment into bitcoin, making use of a broker from an Over The Counter platform will be your best method of approach. And with the ones that were mentioned in this article: they are some of the best that we have found from across the criteria that we mentioned.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrencies-not-currently-viable-for-terrorism-financing-think-tank,"Cryptocurrencies are not well-suited for the needs of terrorist groups, United States nonprofit think tank RAND Corporation states in a report published on March 27.

The report, dubbed “Terrorist Use of Cryptocurrencies: Technical and Organizational Barriers and Future Threats,” is focused on two main angles — how terrorists use cryptocurrencies in their current state and how could they possibly use them in the future as the industry evolves.

The authors believe that cryptocurrencies currently pose no significant threat as a means of terrorism financing. However, if cryptocurrencies started providing anonymity and improved security, combined with the lack of relevant state regulations, the risk of their potential use by terrorists would increase, per the report.

Moreover, RAND believes that trading in countries with no proper regulation or on unregulated markets, such as Darknet, contributes to a higher risk of crypto being used for illicit purposes.

Despite those threats, regulation and oversight of the industry, along with international cooperation between law enforcement and the intelligence community could help prevent terrorists from using crypto to fund their illicit activities, according to RAND.

RAND continues that, as long as new crypto hacks emerge and prices remain unstable, terrorist groups are unlikely to use them to their full potential.

The RAND Corporation (Research ANd Development) is a global policy think tank in Washington D.C. that conducts research and analysis for the U.S. military. Members of RAND have also made contributions to technology, artificial intelligence and the development of the internet.

As Cointelegraph previously wrote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would establish a crypto task force to combat terrorist use of cryptocurrencies in September 2018. It contained a reward policy for assisting regulators in providing information “leading to convictions related to terrorist use of digital currencies.”

As for the darknet, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) sent to hidden network markets increased by 70 percent in 2018. A recent report by Chainalysis states that darknet activity is relatively uninfluenced by BTC price action and does not necessarily drop when the price drops.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/17965/with-bithumb-hack-total-stolen-from-crypto-exchanges-tops-1-3-billion-here-are-the-10-biggest-hacks-ever,,,https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-crypto-exchange-coindelta-shutters-services-citing-adverse-regulatory-conditions,"Indian cryptocurrency exchange Coindelta is terminating its services in light of the adverse operating climate for crypto businesses in the country. The development was announced in an official blog post on March 30.

Eighteen months after its first launch, Coindelta has told users that severe restrictions on banking services for crypto-related firms in India has caused its operating costs to escalate, and that therefore it is not economically viable to continue operations. The post notes:

“It has been really difficult for us to operate Coindelta exchange for the last 6 months. The curb on the bank accounts by RBI has made us handicapped in order to provide seamless deposit and withdrawal services. There has not been any significant progress in the Supreme Court case which makes it difficult to predict when we will see the regulation.”

In April 2018, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), had prohibited all domestic banks from providing services to crypto-related businesses. Protracted regulatory uncertainty has meant that even individuals have reportedly faced bank account closures, as some institutions have apparently widely extrapolated the crypto banking ban to single traders.

In its announcement, Coindelta stated that all crypto trading markets on its platforms were suspended at 2:00 pm (time zone unknown) on March 30.

Any outstanding orders at that time were reportedly cancelled, with user funds returned to their wallets. The exchange has said it will continue to provide wallet services until April 29, 2019, after which it asks users to request withdrawals via its support page or email.

Coindelta is notably charging a fixed fee for all withdrawals, as outlined in the statement. Multiple users have responded to Coindelta on Twitter, arguing that the fee is excessively high and makes the withdrawal of small amounts of crypto deposits untenable.

In a bid to quell community anger and draw business from former clients of its now-shuttered counterpart, rival Indian crypto exchange WazirX notified users on March 30 that it will refund their Coindelta withdrawal fees if they choose to transfer their deposits to its platform.

As previously reported, the status and future of cryptocurrencies in India remains highly contentious. After the RBI’s controversial prohibition came into effect last July, both public and industry-led petitions have appealed to the courts on the grounds that the decision is unconstitutional.

Mr. Chou came from one of those institutions, Goldman Sachs, and created a cryptocurrency exchange, LedgerX, that would cater to big investors with sophisticated financial contracts.

Now, in the wake of last year’s Bitcoin crash, Mr. Chou is being forced to confront how few of the big finance companies acted on their cryptocurrency plans.

“It was definitely part of the original plan that institutions would be a big part of this market,” he said. “We were wrong.”",2019-04-02,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/02/mystery-buyer-bitcoin-price-5000-cryptocurrency/,"Bitcoin BTC has been pumping. Over the past six hours, its value has jumped as much as 20 percent, and a recent report has claimed a “mystery buyer” is responsible.

During Asian trade, Bitcoin‘s value broke $5,000 for the first time since November last year, marking the biggest one-day gain in the past year, Reuters reports.

Trade has since calmed, with the price remaining steady at around $4,700 across major exchanges. The last time Bitcoin was over $4,500 was back in November 2018, around five months ago.

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, head of a cryptocurrency brokerage firm, told Reuters the movement was likely the result of a single buyer, who used a computer algorithm to trigger the purchase of $100 million worth of Bitcoin spread across a number of exchanges.

BTC/USD TradingView over the past 5 days

“There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,” he told Reuters, noting the orders were spread between cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp.

“If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour,” he added.

Another industry insider told Reuters there were 6 million trades over an hour during the price rise, mostly concentrated on Asia-based exchanges. This is three to four times the usual trading volume.

“You trigger other order books to play catch up, and that creates a buying frenzy,” he commented.

Bitcoin‘s price famously almost hit $20,000 in December 2017 and had been gradually falling ever since. By February this year, we had entered the longest Bitcoin bear market in history.

A single $100 million algorithmic order to buy bitcoin was spread across exchanges Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp. The orders were placed in increments of 7,000 BTC at a time and triggered a flurry of subsequent trading volume in the cryptocurrency markets.

Why It’s Important

There was no major fundamental news related to bitcoin that triggered the large order.

“The rally seems to be purely technical in nature as BTC crossed a key level of $4,200 and there wasn't any notable news that came out during this time,” said eToro analyst Mati Greenspan.

Bitcoin prices hit their highest level since November, trading at $4,775 on Tuesday morning. Tuesday’s move marks the largest single-day gain for bitcoin since April 2018, but the cryptocurrency remains well off its all-time high price of near $20,000 back in December 2017.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies took a beating in 2018 due to concerns over regulation and security. The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a cryptocurrency ETF for listing on a major U.S. exchange due to concerns over market liquidity and investor safety. Am estimated $1.7 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges and investors in 2018, according to cybersecurity firm CypherTrace.

In addition, a March study from Bitwise found that 95 percent of daily bitcoin trading volume on CoinMarketCap.com is faked by unregulated exchanges. The relatively low liquidity makes the cryptocurrency market much more vulnerable to manipulation and volatility, such as Tuesday’s big move.

While the anonymous trader seemed to target only bitcoin, several other cryptocurrencies reacted to the buying volume:

Bitcoin was up up 15.5 percent to $4,775.

Ethereum was up 9.8 percent to $156.

XRP was up 7 percent to 33 cents.

Litecoin was up 13.4 percent to $68.

EOS was up 10.8 percent to $4.64.

What’s Next?

Cryptocurrency traders will be watching to see if the big buyer has triggered an extended technical rally in cryptocurrencies. They will also be on the lookout for potential fundamental headlines in the coming days that may have driven the buying.

Despite Tuesday’s rally, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Btc) (OTC: GBTC) is down 52.6 percent overall in the past year.

Billionaire Elon Musk has a favorite cryptocurrency — Dogecoin (DOGE). We knew Musk was a fan of crypto after he touted the brilliance of bitcoin, suggesting paper money would eventually disappear. His preference for Dogecoin comes as a welcome surprise and has emboldened the meme-happy community.

After months of the crypto community trying to get Musk’s attention with the BTC Lightning Torch, the Tesla founder finally took the bait, only it wasn’t bitcoin. Musk responded to an April Fools’ Dogecoin poll in which he is named among potential CEO candidates alongside heavy blockchain hitters Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, and Marshall Hayner. Musk tweeted:

“Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”

Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2019

Much Wow, Very Meme

That’s a good thing, considering Musk ran away with nearly three-quarters of the vote at last check (69%), followed by Hayner, Buterin, and Lee, respectively. He is already at the helm of Tesla, SpaceX, and the Boring Company, to name a few. What’s one more? Musk’s declaration inspired much and very memes from the Dogecoin community:

Musk couldn’t have picked a better time to jump on the DOGE bandwagon after the top-26 coin rallied by double-digits on April Fool’s Day. Today, the mineable cryptocurrency that was created as a joke is up another 3%.

Dogecoin on the CEO Hunt

The beauty of Dogecoin has been its decentralized nature considering nobody controls the project. It is described as internet currency and has gained rock-star status in the crypto community for its Shiba Inu mascot, Doge.

Jackson Palmer, who created Dogecoin in 2013, is no longer associated with DOGE or any cryptocurrency. Musk’s interest in the project must surprise nobody more than Palmer, who is either kicking himself or patting himself on the back right now.

Meanwhile, the Dogecoin team ribbed their followers with an April Fools’ joke in which they stated:

“We have listened to your concerns. We have decided that Dogecoin does need a CEO. Someone who can lead us into the future while maintaining the core values of what we are.”

The joke is apparently on everyone who dismissed Dogecoin, whose pronunciation and purpose are often the subject of ridicule.

Bitcoin’s Bull Run

Perhaps Musk will also catch bitcoin fever, especially now that the biggest cryptocurrency appears to be back in bullish terrain. After meandering around the $4,000 level for much of March, the bitcoin price has jumped more than 20% this morning and crossed $5,000. Now that the BTC price has surpassed the key $4,200 technical level, the bearish calls have officially been drowned out.

As of the afternoon of Asian trading hours, data from Coinmarketcap showed that more than $84 billion had been traded in the cryptocurrency space over the last 24 hours.

As of 1:36 p.m. HK/SIN, the price of ethereum had surged 12.46 percent in 24 hours to $166.66, according to data from Coindesk. Ripple's XRP token also rose 6.55 percent to approximately $0.346. While bitcoin has by far the largest market cap of any digital token, ethereum and XRP hold the second and third positions, respectively.

Hot on the heels of bitcoin surging to multi-month highs , other major cryptocurrencies are also posting big moves upward.

One expert told CNBC on Tuesday that one potential catalyst behind the surge in bitcoin was likely tied to a Reuters report of a private buyer purchasing more than $100 million worth of bitcoin over a short period.

For its part, Bitcoin jumped more than 3 percent higher over 24 hours to $4,924.21, according to Coindesk. It had earlier breached the $5,000 level.

Given the small daily trading volume of bitcoin, ""that order would be enough to have an impact,"" said Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, which is in the process of applying for the first-ever bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

That large purchase of bitcoin could have been triggered by an individual trader or a small group of traders, according to Zennon Kapron, director at financial technology consultancy Kapronasia.

Speaking with CNBC over the phone, Kapron said there were many traders sitting on ""significant amounts of bitcoin"" who could ""very well be behind the movement.""

Still, Bitwise's Horsely said: ""Crypto is famous for a long history of volatility like this. It's always hard to pin down the true impetus, and often the real source is not obvious.""

Other possible reasons for the surge include the crossing of an important technical level at the $4,200 price triggering a stop-loss trade. (In bitcoin and other assets, traders will often set a certain level for when they automatically cover their shorts.)

Asked about the rally's sustainability, Kapron said prices were likely to come back down if there was nothing to support them. And, he added, there was ""nothing in particular"" that drove the recent price spikes aside from general market demand.

Bitcoin prices have seen a relatively calm 2019 after last year's volatility. The cryptocurrency fell roughly 75 percent in 2018 after climbing to a high of almost $20,000 at the end of 2017.

— CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report.",2019-04-03,https://www.coindesk.com/xrp-exchange-traded-product-goes-live-on-swiss-six-exchange,"An exchange-traded product (ETP) tracking the price of the XRP cryptocurrency has gone live on Switzerland’s primary stock exchange SIX.

Amun AG, the maker of the product, announced the news on Tuesday, saying that the XRP ETP had started trading on the exchange under the ticker symbol AXRP.

The firm first revealed it would launch an XRP ETP last month. Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of Amun AG told CoinDesk at the time that his firm already had an approval in place from SIX to issue the product.

With today’s launch, Amun AG now has a total of four cryptocurrency ETP products listed on the SIX exchange. Last month, the firm launched an ethereum (ETH)-based ETP (AETH). The month prior a bitcoin (BTC)-based ETP (ABTC) went live, and the firm launched the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP under the ticker symbol HODL in November.

The HODL product tracks the top 5 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization and liquidity. It currently comprises BTC, XRP, ETH, bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC).

Rashwan told CoinDesk on Tuesday that Amun AG wants to make investing in cryptocurrency “as easy as buying a stock.”

“We seek to create an easy, safe, and regulated way for investors to access the crypto asset class,” he said.

As long as any cryptocurrency has “sufficient liquidity, good development records, and no nefarious activity,” the firm would continue adding ETP products, Rashwan indicated, adding:

“We plan on launching other strategies, more single asset ETPs, and more indices! We are planning on having 6–8 additional launches this year.”

All four ETP products are built and issued by Amun AG’s own platform – the Amun Onyx. The platform also operates the products once they go live on the SIX exchange, according to the statement.

The firm said it is also signing on external customers to use the Onyx platform to launch their own traditional and tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

BC Group, which owns a portfolio of various blockchain companies, including cryptocurrency trading platform Anxone and digital asset brokerage OSL, said it decided to build the service to respond to the needs of institutional investors in Asia.

Its release, it says, constitutes the first such insured custody solution for crypto assets available locally, but will use United Kingdom-based insurers.

“BC Group’s custody service removes one of the key barriers that has to date prevented professional traders and institutions from adding digital assets to their portfolios,” the firm’s chief technology officer, Hugh Madden, commented in the press release. He added:

“These traders can only transact on exchanges that align with strict regulatory and fiduciary guidelines and meet high compliance and security standards. Insured custody is a vital component in meeting these standards.”

“BC Group route all incoming digital asset transfers directly to cold storage and advocate this as the industry standard,” Madden added, echoing practices from custody firms such as Switzerland’s Xapo.

BC will capitalize on the burgeoning institutional investor market which is set for greater expansion worldwide in 2019.

As Cointelegraph reported, this year should see the debut of products such as trading platform Bakkt, which will offer various crypto-related tools to investors, beginning with physically-delivered Bitcoin futures.

Last year, Cointelegraph further noted the increasing trend in insurance options for cryptocurrency industry businesses.",

Cryptocurrency prices have improved a great deal over the last seven days and many digital assets saw a significant spike in value on April 2. The entire market capitalization of all 2,000-odd coins is steadily approaching $200 billion. The market forerunner so far is bitcoin cash (BCH), which is up well over 45% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Economy Nears $200 Billion

Digital currency fans are far more optimistic this week since many cryptocurrencies gained between 10-60% in the last two days. The overall cryptocurrency valuation of the economy today is $174 billion at the time of publication. Moreover, global trade volume has increased fivefold ($77 billion) over the last three weeks, which means people are swapping a lot more coins these days. Bitcoin core (BTC) markets show BTC is trading for $5,022 with a market cap of around $88.4 billion today.

The cryptocurrency is up 5.4% over the last 24 hours and BTC is also up 23% for the week. This is followed by ethereum (ETH) markets, where each ETH is swapping for $170 per coin this Wednesday. The third highest market valuation belongs to ripple (XRP) which is trading for $0.36 per token. Litecoin (LTC) still holds the fourth position and each coin is $85 per LTC at press time.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

The top 10 forerunner leading the pack is bitcoin cash (BCH) by a long shot. BCH prices have jumped well over 50 percent in the last 24 hours. Since then there’s been a pullback in price but BCH is still more than 45 percent higher than it was the day before. Weekly statistics show BCH is also up 69 percent for the week as each coin is priced at $288 at press time. BCH recently captured the fifth largest market position with an overall market cap of around $5.11 billion today. The top five exchanges swapping the most BCH by trade volume are Lbank, Binance, Fcoin, Huobi, and Coinbase. The top trading pair with bitcoin cash today is USDT which captures 43.8% of trades. This is followed by BTC (34.4%), USD (11.9%), KRW (4.2%), and JPY (2%). There’s been a big increase in EUR/BCH pairs (1.7%) as well, which historically happens during bullish times.

BCH/USD Technical Indicators

Looking at the 4-hour BCH/USD chart on Kraken and Bitstamp shows bulls attempted to break more ground during the early morning trading sessions but met resistance. There have been many signs of BCH bouncing high since last February’s bearish crossover which indicated the bottom may be in and better prices were coming. Today prices are much higher but the Relative Strength Index (RSI ~87) is screaming overbought conditions which means the bullish jump may scale back a hair. Stochastic (~90) is reading neutral and the flexible indicator Ichimoku Cloud (9, 26, 52, 26) baseline is also impartial at the moment.

The MACd, a momentum oscillator that subtracts the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, shows that consolidation may take place in the short term. The 4-hour BCH/USD chart shows the two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) still have a decent gap with the short term 100 SMA still above the long term 200 SMA. This means that the bulls still have the reins and the path toward the least resistance is still the upside, but not for very long. According to order books, there’s some heavy resistance between the $300-325 zone and some other sell order stops above that region. On the backside, there are some solid foundations forming which will fend bears off at $250 through the $200 range.

Bitcoin Cash Breaks 200-Day Average

Overall, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are very positive about the market sentiment and the change of tides. Still, there’s uncertainty in the air on how long this bullish run will last and whether market whales are faking people out once again after the countless bull traps and dead cat bounces in 2018. Moreover, all eyes have been drawn to the massive BCH rally that’s been happening since the cryptocurrency smashed its 200-day moving average. Further, Crypto Facilities, a Kraken-based subsidiary, detailed earlier this week that both BCH and LTC futures contracts have towered over other asset contracts. In light of all that action, the popular exchange Huobi announced today it is launching BCH derivative contracts on April 5.

While some major cryptocurrencies are seeing a mild surge in price, others boast double-digit gains.

Market visualization from Coin360

BTC, which skyrocketed yesterday and gained over 14 percent in price over 24 hours, spent a few hours above the $5,000 mark earlier today. The world’s top coin peaked at $5,043 at some point, according to CoinMarketCap stats, before going back to $4,900. As of press time, BTC is trading sideways, hovering around $5,007.

Bitcoin’s market cap has gained over $1 billion compared to yesterday’s charts, when BTC was mostly trading around $4,700. Reaching around $88 billion during the night peak, BTC market cap currently totals around $87.4 billion.

Ethereum (ETH), currently the world’s second-top cryptocurrency by market cap, enters April 3 in the green, with up to 10 percent gains in 24 hours. While the coin’s rate was hovering around $150 yesterday, today it is trading above $165. ETH’s market cap gained almost $2 billion in a day, climbing up to $17.6 billion at press time.

Ripple (XRP), ranked as the third-top cryptocurrency, has also been on the rise for the third consecutive day. The coin, which is now trading at $0.35, saw over 5 percent gains within 24 hours. Its market cap is $1 billion larger than yesterday — over $14.7 billion.

The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has also seen a significant increase in comparison to April 2, when it peaked at $163 billion. The highest point today has been at $176.9 billion, declining to around $173.8 billion at press time.

As for other altcoins, all major currencies except Maker (MKR) and Tezos (XTZ) are in the green and seeing moderate to visible gains in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has jumped to over $280, showing gains of around 50 percent. Another major winner is Litecoin (LTC), gaining over 20 percent within a day and trading at $84.

Dogecoin (DOGE), recently promoted by Tesla’s Elon Musk as his favourite coin, has seen over a 30 percent rise in price following the entrepreneur’s tweet.

The major market recovery, which started late April 1, has been widely discussed both in the crypto community and financial world. Most of the crypto insiders state that there is no particular reason behind the leap, and that all of the explanations are currently speculatory.

For instance, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, most known as CZ, admits that he’s “clueless” about the real causes of what is happening, while Bloomberg author Eric Lam also believes that there is no definite answer.

However, Lam cites an April Fool’s Day story that claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had finally approved a Bitcoin ETF as possibly affecting the crypto markets, and CNBC shares his stance.

Another reason cited by Bloomberg is, conversely, Brexit, as some believe that investors are changing pounds to BTC in the wake of Britain’s divorce with the EU. Some earlier forecasts also cited this theory.

Bloomberg also published an analysis today naming algorithmic hedge fund trading to the possible reasons behind the price surge.

Reuters mentions a mysterious order that could have been responsible for boosting crypto prices as well. According to the financial experts quoted by the news agency, the gain was probably triggered by a 20,000 BTC order (around $100 million as of press time) that was spread around U.S.-based crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp.",,https://grizzle.com/crypto-spring/,"A recent surge in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) by over 20% in the past 36 hours has led many to wonder whether the bear market for crypto also known as crypto winter is turning the corner into crypto spring.

Around midnight Eastern time yesterday Bitcoin prices surged from just under $4,200 USD to $5,000 USD. Although there was a brief pullback, momentum in the price of the cryptocurrency has continued with it trading around the $5,000 mark as of the time of publishing of this article.

Bitcoin Price over Past 36 Hours

This leads to the question, what has caused this sudden return of volatility and the potential birth of a crypto spring given that crypto markets had been relatively calm over the past several months ever since the sell off that started in November?

There have been several theories floated around.

Bitcoin ETF April Fools

On Monday an article from the website Finance Magnates outlined an emergency meeting by the SEC over the weekend whereby they ruled to approve two bitcoin-based ETFs. This far-fetched narrative was quite obviously an April Fools joke, which was clear to anyone who actually read the contents of the article. However, the joke did bring back some attention to what had been very quiet crypto markets.

Bitcoin Whale Reportedly Buys $100 million in BTC

A more likely explanation for the sudden surge in the price of bitcoin comes from a report by Reuters that an “algorithmically-managed” order for around 20,000 BTC (~$100 million USD) spread across crypto exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp was placed at the same time the price jumped. Reuters spoke with Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of crypto firm BCB Group who found patterns in the volumes of the trades on those three exchanges that suggested they were from a single buyer.

Altcoins Jump on the Bandwagon

The crypto spring hasn’t been isolated to Bitcoin either. The next 5 top cryptocurrencies by market cap have followed bitcoin’s price resurgence over the past 36 hours. In particular, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) have surged significantly, outperforming the other coins. This could be due to the exuberance that the BCH and LTC communities have in rallying around momentum trading.

Yesterday, the billionaire unexpectedly championed a Bitcoin-style joke currency called Dogecoin.

The price of Dogecoin then shot up by roughly 50%, although investors might not want to start celebrating just yet because one unit of the currency is still worth just $0.0034.

In the early hours of yesterday morning, Musk tweeted: ‘Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.’

Dogecoin adopted an internet meme as its logo

The Shiba Inu meme started to go viral in 2013

The price then began to shoot up, although it’s not clear whether this is down to the Elon effect or a wider cryptocurrency rally taking place right now.

Musk later said the hound-themed cryptocurrency ‘rulez’, before changing his Twitter bio to describe himself as Dogecoin CEO.

Dogecoin, which was originally invented to mock the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, adopted a Shina Inu dog as its logo after it became the star of a meme in 2013.

It’s highly likely that the Tesla and SpaceX boss is joking about his love of Dogecoin.

But earlier this year he revealed how a similar joke got him suspended from Twitter.

Musk spoke to analysts from ARK Invest during a half hour podcast which discussed ‘the future of Tesla and autonomous driving’.

At the end of the chat, talk turned to cryptocurrencies.

Scammers infamously set up several fake social media accounts in Elon’s name which promised to hand out free Ethereum but were actually designed to steal victims’ personal information.

‘Bitcoin and Ethereum scammers were so rampant on Twitter that I thought I’d just join in,’ he said on the podcast.

However, this proved to be a bit of a mistake, because a tongue in cheek tweet which mimicked these con artists was accidentally flagged up by Twitter as breaking its terms of service.

‘I said at one point: “Want to buy some Bitcoin?”

‘My account got suspended because of some automatic rule against selling Bitcoin or something.

‘I was just joking.’

Later in the interview, Musk also appeared to laugh and joke about Bitcoin being used to buy ‘coke’.

The interviewer said Bitcoin was not mainstream yet because we don’t use it to purchase coffee and Coca-Cola, which prompted a mumbled reply from Musk which seemed humorous in nature.

Cryptocurrencies are certainly used for buying cocaine, with dark web markets running a roaring trade in all sorts of drugs purchased using Bitcoin or other digital denominations.

In the podcast, Musk went on to praise cryptocurrencies as well as sounding the alarm about the energy required to ‘mine’ them.

‘The Bitcoin structure is quite brilliant and it seems there is some merit to Ethereum as well,’ he added.

‘I’m not sure that it’s a good use of Tesla resources to get involved in crypto.

‘We’re really trying to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy and I think one of the downsides of crypto is that, computationally, it’s quite energy intensive.’

Musk seemed confident about the future of Bitcoin and other forms of virtual cash.

Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2019

Started as a joke but with a similar functionality as Bitcoin, Dogecoin has amassed a loyal following which nurtures a peculiar sense of humor, something Musk is known for. In a later tweet, Musk posted a Dogecoin meme, saying the cryptocurrency ""rulz"" (internet slang for rules, which means that it's great).

Despite having no major distinctive features from numerous other cryptocoins, Dogecoin remains fairly popular. At one point it reached a market cap of nearly $2 billion, prompting its founder Jackson Palmer (who has long moved on from the world of cryptocurrencies) to declare it — and the entire crypto market — a bubble.

Right now, Dogecoin is the 25th largest cryptocurrency by market cap (according to CoinMarketCap), with a valuation of over $374 million. Its price has risen nearly 25% in the last 24 hours alone.

Musk previously expressed an interest in cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, so the latest Dogecoin endorsement isn't too surprising. Heck, if you think that's odd, you should check his recent rap track about the late Cincinnati Zoo gorilla Harambe.

There are so many types of virtual currencies — like litecoin, ethereum, ripple and, of course, bitcoin — that ""there's no way that even a fraction of them can survive,"" Mallouk, who is also author of ""The 5 Mistakes Every Investor Makes and How to Avoid Them,"" tells CNBC Make It.

""Is it possible that maybe one or two will work out in the future? Sure it is."" But, he says, ""in the meantime,"" if you buy cryptocurrency, ""you get no income. It's not a real investment. It's speculation."" Instead, invest in ""things that are going to pay you to own them,"" he says. ""Own real estate, where you're collecting rent. Own stocks, where you're collecting dividends. Own bonds, where you're collecting yield."" As a general rule of thumb, ""You don't want to own something that's not going to pay you,"" says Mallouk.

If you're excited by blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, there are ways to invest in that besides buying crypto, he adds: ""There are companies that are very heavily investing in blockchain and you can buy those companies — companies like IBM and Accenture."" And ""companies like Walmart are using it to develop ways to run their inventory,"" he adds. ""That's the way to play blockchain technology — not by trying to buy cryptocurrency."" Keep in mind, he continues, that while ""blockchain technology is real and you've got big companies like IBM and Accenture and others investing in it, that doesn't mean that bitcoin is going to work out or ripple is going to work out,"" says Mallouk. ""The TV worked out, but everything that comes out of it, we don't want to watch. Palm and Blackberry were fantastic, but Apple came in and took them out. Lycos and Excite were here before Google.""

The firm, which is owned by Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Quoine, announced Wednesday that, with the closing of the Series C round, its “over $1 billion” valuation makes it “one of only two tech unicorns in Japan’s startup space.”

Liquid.com, however, did not disclose the amount invested by IDG Capital and Bitmain, the former of which led the round.

The funds will be put toward global expansion and product development, as well as to support a move into the security token market, it said.

“Our vision is to make financial services accessible to all, which means bringing more people into the digital asset space so that anyone can be a part of it,” according to Liquid.com CEO Mike Kayamori.

Quoine launched the Liquid.com platform back in September to provide users with access to a “worldwide network of cryptocurrency exchanges.”

Liquid said it has previously raised more than $20 million from venture capital firms, including JAFCO, SBI, B Dash Ventures and ULS Group. While in 2017, it said it raised more than $100 million in a “pre-discounted” and “regulated” initial coin offering (ICO).

Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu said:

The Supreme Court of India has set a new date to hear the crypto case. News.Bitcoin.com has learned what happened in the latest hearing when the government was expected to deliver crypto regulation and why the case was adjourned within minutes.

Crypto Case Update

During the hearing on Friday, India’s supreme court was expected to hear about the country’s crypto regulation from the government as well as address the petitions against the banking restriction by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, the court adjourned without much progress on either matter.

News.Bitcoin.com talked to lawyer Jaideep Reddy on Tuesday who was at the hearing about what actually happened. He represents the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), on behalf of Nishith Desai Associates, in its writ petition against the RBI ban.

“The matter started with a counsel for the respondents asking for a passover of the matter (i.e., for the matter to be heard at the end of the list for the day). However, the Bench stated that the matter should be heard and that a passover would not be entertained,” Reddy explained. “The respondents are both the government and the RBI, among others,” he clarified. Regarding the banking restriction, he detailed:

Mr. Gopal Subramanium, Senior Advocate for IAMAI, stated to the Bench that this is a matter of high importance and should be heard at length. The counsel for the respondents then asked for the matter to be heard on a non-miscellaneous day … The Bench accepted this request and has now ordered that the matter be heard on July 23, which is after the court’s summer vacation.

Reddy also noted that “Mondays and Fridays are ‘miscellaneous’ days of the supreme court and the present matter is considered to be of a ‘non-miscellaneous’ nature.” The recently released court order from Friday’s hearing confirms the new date. “Upon hearing the counsel the court made the following order … List the matter on 23rd July, 2019,” the order shows.

No Crypto Regulation but RBI Ban Continues

During the February hearing, the Indian supreme court gave the government four weeks to come up with crypto regulation. However, Reddy shared with news.Bitcoin.com Tuesday:

The hearing only lasted for a few minutes and this [crypto regulation] did not come up, given that the case was adjourned.

India’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is being drafted by an interministerial committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The government’s counsel previously told the supreme court that this committee was in its final stages of deliberations.

Meanwhile, the banking restriction which went into effect in July last year has put the Indian crypto industry in limbo.

Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, shut down its exchange operations in India last September due to the banking problem. Another major crypto exchange, Unocoin, launched a cash kiosk last October to allow its users to deposit and withdraw INR. However, law enforcement mistook the machine as an ATM that violated the RBI ban and arrested two of the company’s founders.

On Sunday, 18-month-old crypto exchange Coindelta announced that it had to terminate service after suffering from the banking restriction over the past six months.

Do you think the Indian supreme court will lift the RBI ban in July? Let us know in the comments section below.

Out of the 20 top coins by market cap, only two altcoins are seeing some growth over the day. Ranked 17th and 18th by market cap, NEO (NEO) and Ontology (ONT) are up around 4.4 and 3.8%, respectively.

The biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is trading at $4,972, down around 2% over the past 24 hours. Having hit a multi-month high of $5,303 earlier on the day, Bitcoin is struggling to hold the $5,000 support, having dropped below the mark five times to date. The intraday low has amounted to $4,924.

With that, Bitcoin is holding significant momentum, up 22% over the past 7 days.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance on the market has slightly increased, accounting for 51% of the market at press time, with a market cap of about $800 billion.

Earlier today, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of the second-largest crypto exchange Binance, revealed that its fiat-to-crypto exchange subsidiary in Singapore will be opened later in April.

Following a crypto rally on April 2, Brian Kelly, the founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM, predicted that the next Bitcoin target will be $6,000. Also on April 2, Bitcoin analyst Tone Vays said that the crypto market surge may have no specific catalyst, and that lower prices could still be in the cards.

On the same day, software startup DataLight published a report claiming that within a decade, Bitcoin is expected to usurp current global payment systems such as Visa, MasterCard and PayPal.

Or both.

Bitcoin awoke from its slumber this week. The cryptocurrency’s price, which after reaching $20,000 in 2017 has languished near $4,000 for most of 2019, surged more than 20% on Tuesday (April 2), surpassing $5,000. The cause? A mystery trader—or group of traders—reportedly placed a series of large orders on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp.

“There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 [bitcoins],” said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, founder of BCB, a cryptocurrency financial services firm. “If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 [bitcoins] in an hour,” he explained to Reuters.

Indeed, order books reflect the surge, which occurred between 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm PT April 1.

The major pullback that was expected after such a huge rally has not materialized just yet. Crypto markets are still holding gains made this week and a couple of higher cap altcoins are pushing even further. Total market capitalization has remained above $170 billion and momentum continues to build slowly this Thursday.

Bitcoin is holding steady but has corrected a little after reaching an intraday high of $5,300 a few hours ago. Volume remains high at $22 billion and BTC has traded above $5k for the best part of the last 24 hours. It is currently up 2% on the same time yesterday, trading at $5,030 according to CMC.

Ethereum has pulled back a little dropping under $165 again as buying pressure cools for the world’s second largest crypto asset. Ethereum has pretty much missed out during this entire market rally as it has only made 15% whereas many of the others have made double that. XRP is also dropping back marginally and has also been comparatively weak this week with a gain of just 10%.

There are two altcoins dominating the top ten at the moment with double digit gains for the third day in a row. Bitcoin Cash is crushing it with a double flippening over EOS and LTC to take fourth spot in terms of market cap. BCH has added a further 21% on the day to reach $310 – its total gain this week has been an epic 82%. Litecoin is the other big mover today, and all week, with a 24 hour gain of 10% as LTC closes in on $90. The combined volume for these two alone is over $10 billion.

None of the others have moved much today aside from EOS and Cardano adding a couple of percent. The top twenty sees Bitcoin SV, NEO and Ontology leading the pack with gains of 5 to 6 percent on the day. Tron, Tezos and NEM have pulled back 3 to 4 percent.

FOMO: Dogecoin Driven by Huobi

Today’s top one hundred top performer is Dogecoin with a jump of 25%. The crypto clown started to climb a few days ago following a manipulated April Fools pump. DOGE is now up to 77 satoshis, a jump of 54% this week against Bitcoin. A listing on Huobi has initiated today’s fomo pump;

Reddcoin and IOST are both doing well today with 20% pumps and REPO is close behind. A massive dump is going on at Maximine Coin as it sheds over 65% following a botched up fork and failure of exchanges to carry out wallet upgrades. KuCoin Shares are also in pain losing 18% today.

Total market capitalization hit another 2019 high a few hours ago of $185 billion. It has since corrected to $175 billion but is still up on yesterday’s levels by 2.3%. Volume remains at record levels over $80 billion and the momentum is largely being driven by Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin at the moment. Despite Bitcoin’s big pump its market dominance remains at 50.7%.

But then again, my advice to anyone who says you should invest in cryptocurrencies [is] you should just kick them.” The rest of Weaver’s 20-minute presentation was as provocative as its title: “Cryptocurrency: Burn It With Fire.” Naturally, we had to speak with him.

What were your main arguments of your talk at the Enigma conference?

First of all, the cryptocurrencies don’t actually work as currency. That’s the big deal. They’re hard to buy because they are deliberately incompatible with the rest of the financial system. They’re incredibly hard to hold on to because, well, something goes wrong it’s “Sorry for your loss.” That’s a function of the irreversible design. And finally, they’re actually really hard to spend. Most merchants who accept cryptocurrency aren’t actually accepting cryptocurrency, they’re using a service that turns it into dollars.

Weaver's Enigma talk, ""Cryptocurrency: Burn It With Fire.""

You’ve called bitcoin “bovine excrement.” What gets you so riled up about cryptocurrency?

Because they are provably inferior to alternative payment mechanisms, with one exception: They do have censorship resistance. So if you want to be a currency of crime, cryptocurrency is the only online choice. And as a result, cryptocurrencies have these huge externalities. What has happened is they’re useful for extortion and stuff like that. The mining for “proof-of-waste” is such that it’s about the same amount of power draw as Singapore, and in a way that actually disfavors renewables. So the externalities are huge, and the benefits are effectively nonexistent.

Have you ever actually owned crypto, or were you resistant to it from the start?

From the start, I knew it was bogus. Back in 2013, I wrote how irreversibility means that cryptocurrencies will never be useful for payments compared to the alternatives. I did have one bitcoin—one of those physical bitcoins, back when they were 20 bucks. In our research group, you give a presentation, you got a bitcoin. I ended up donating that to the Ross Ulbricht [founder of the dark web market Silk Road] Legal Defense Fund after he was convicted.

So you’re a Ross Ulbricht supporter?

No, I’m not. I support his mother. I feel very sorry for his mother, and the defense was grossly incompetent. I was hoping she would use the money to retire some debts and fire the idiot [lawyer] and go with a ineffective counsel appeal. But they did not. They stuck with the same idiot for the appeal. And so as a result, Ross Ulbricht will never see the light of day.

Do you think Ross is guilty of what he’s been—

Oh, he’s so guilty. The reason why the defense was an absolute joke is the only defense that would have worked would be getting the server seizure tossed out. And the defense literally threw that away, even after getting a handwritten note from the judge: “Oh, are you sure you want to throw away the case like this?” And they did it anyway. The guy was caught, logged in as DPR [Dread Pirate Roberts, the Silk Road administrator’s alias] with the computer that had DPR’s stash of treasure. The attempts to procure hits were amusingly incompetent, but the payments were from the stash on his computer, not on the Silk Road server. He was just so guilty. And the defense was so mishandled.

I wrote a profile of Ross’s mom, Lyn, and the people who support her and Ross insist that he was railroaded.

I was watching the thing carefully from the instant he was arrested. And the FBI did a real nice job on arresting him to preserve the evidence on his computer. It was an open-and-shut case, and to deny otherwise is to deny reality. The defense was a Chewbacca defense once it got to trial, and as a consequence, there was no way they were getting him off.

Aside from uses in crime, you seem to find no real redeeming qualities in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Is there anything else that you think blockchain would be good for?

Let’s split out the term blockchain into two separate things. You’ve got the private blockchains, which are an append-only data structure. We’ve known how to build these for 20 years. And if indeed your problem can be solved by putting it an append-only data structure, it should already be in the git-archive or certificate-transparency chain or all these other data-structure devices that we know how to do. The public, or permission-less, ones—the ones behind the cryptocurrency—they’re interesting from a research viewpoint, but they aren’t actually useful for anything other than the cryptocurrencies themselves.

""If you look at the entire field of cryptocurrencies, it is literally speed-running 500 years of economic failures. And when they reinvent economic successes, they do it badly.""

As a computer science researcher, is any of the technology impressive to you at all?

I thought proof-of-work was clever initially, about five, six years ago. It’s just only recently I realized just how bad it is compared with articulating trust. There is some cool work on distributed systems. But the rest is basically comedy gold. If you look at the entire field of cryptocurrencies, it is literally speed-running 500 years of economic failures. And when they reinvent economic successes, they do it badly. Tether is an 18th century wildcat bank. They’re issuing their own bank notes.

Every single ICO on the planet that isn’t restricted to accredited investors is effectively an unregistered security, and some of them are ridiculous. When I was doing my talk, I had to decide between “HIV cure on the blockchain” and “alchemy on the blockchain,” and I went with the latter.

There’s alchemy on the blockchain?

Yes, there was a ICO for alchemy on the blockchain.

How was that purported to work?

[Laughs.] I don’t know. It was alchemy on the blockchain.

You also have the tulip mania recaptured with CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties was pure tulip mania.

But CryptoKitties was fun. Can you not admit is was fun?

They’re deformed little things that somehow were worth $100,000 for a short period of time, assuming somebody else would buy it for $150,000.

And the Ponzi schemes are amazingly rife. The only really innovative new idea is smart contracts, and smart contracts are a disaster, too.

Why are smart contracts a disaster?

First of all, there’s the concept: Let’s replace standard contracts written in a language we call legalese with something written in a language that’s worse than JavaScript, and in the process remove the exception-handling mechanism. If you can go up to a smart contract and say, “Hey, give me all your money” and it goes, “Okey-doke,” is that even theft? That’s within the text of the smart contract. The reality is, these are basically just finance bots: programs that operate on money. Our financial system has run on finance bots for decades now. The only difference is the smart contract finance bots are public. And that means that anybody can interact with them and exploit them. The only real utilities people have written with them are effectively Ponzi schemes and a framework for these unlicensed stock offerings.

How much pushback from the crypto community do you get for your views?

A fair amount, but it’s kind of background noise. You can generally ignore it. The problem is that they don’t listen to my arguments. And I look at their arguments and conclude they don’t make sense. So yeah, there’s some pushback, but it’s not the kind of thing that’s really of interest to me. What’s of interest is how things can fail in interesting ways. There are two things that I think can really cause the cryptocurrency market to totally fail.

First is actual legal enforcement, particularly around Tether. The conclusion is these days 95 percent of [trading volume on] the exchanges [is] effectively fraudulent. These are all the same exchanges that are already cut off from the banking system and use Tether. [If] Tether is [found to be] a criminal enterprise, and the feds arrested those behind Tether and gave Tether the Liberty Reserve treatment, it would effectively collapse all the exchanges.

What’s the second way?

The second is a technical death spiral situation. The problem with bitcoin mining is it’s wasting a lot of energy, and it will always waste a lot of energy as long as the price is high. If the price drops, however, there may be scenarios where we have a large amount of mining equipment that ends up getting turned off. That equipment is not profitable to run 24/7/365 to mint cryptocurrency, but would be profitable to synchronize and turn on for a few hours in order to attack the security of the system.

""The problem with cryptocurrency is it's basically a Venn diagram: those who don't understand economics intersected with those who don't really understand computer security.""

Have you ever met your fellow crypto naysayer Nouriel Roubini?

Only online.

Do you see him as an ally?

I see him as a really insightful economist. The problem with cryptocurrency is it’s basically a Venn diagram: those who don’t understand economics intersected with those who don’t really understand computer security. The cryptocurrency defenders tend to attack economists with “Oh, you don’t understand the technology.” And Roubini is really willing to push back against those arguments, because, well, those arguments are irrelevant. The problems with the cryptocurrencies are really economic, not technical.

Initially I thought bitcoin was a clever hack. And I still think it’s kind of a clever hack, but it’s a clever hack without redeeming value at this point. And the problems are economic.

What about Roubini’s approach? He seems to delight in being contrarian.

I don’t think he delights in being contrarian. He just delights in putting down markers that the future will prove to be right. Why was he called Dr. Doom? Because he predicted a large amount of the failure mechanism that happened in 2007, 2008. I don’t think he’s being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian on cryptocurrency. He’s being contrarian because he sees something that he believes has been a large net negative, and that’s going to end badly for a lot of people. I can’t speak for him, but I don’t like that. That’s why I’ve gotten much more vocal in my contrariness. I see a lot of people are going to lose, or have already lost, a lot of money.

Is there anyone in the crypto community whose views you respect?

I like Emin Gün Sirer. He’s a real serious academic. I think he’s wrong about the future on some of these distributed systems. But he’s doing interesting research, and he points out problems when they occur. He, for example, pointed out that reentrancy bugs are going to be a problem in Ethereum. And Ethereum folks ignored him and ended up having the DAO fiasco. I also really respect Matthew Green and company at Johns Hopkins. They do good research.

Get the BREAKERMAG newsletter, a weekly roundup of blockchain business and culture.



Basically, the big difference between me and [Green] is he believes that censorship resistance and privacy are good things. I have come to the reluctant belief that censorship resistance and financial privacy cause far too much collateral damage. I like to quip “Cryptocurrency has committed a crime against me.” It has made a Silicon Valley semi-libertarian believe in the jackbooted authoritarianism of money-laundering laws.

So the crypto space has changed your worldview?

Yes. Before the cryptocurrency booms and bust, I had these moral objections to a lot of the aggressive money-laundering laws that are in play. Like if you deposit more than $10,000, that gets automatically flagged and blah, blah, blah. And look at what the cryptocurrency space has wrought: drug deals, ransomware, extortion, all those things that would not happen in the regulated commercial banking system. I now actually do believe that money-laundering laws are essential and need to be enforced with vigor. Because when we don’t have that, we have a huge amount of externalities.

If you had your druthers, how would how would we do away with crypto and blockchain?

Well, there’s three things. First of all, black hats can get a lot more aggressive at stealing. The North Koreans have only stolen half a billion dollars [in crypto]. Personally, I think they should up their game and try to add an extra zero to that amount, and there’s ways that that can happen.

Are you advocating that a foreign country steal our cryptocurrency?

No, I’m advocating that if the North Koreans want to hack everybody and be obnoxious, they could be doing a better job of it. But that’s more just something that that the cryptocurrency defenders need to watch out for, that there are scenarios where somebody could do really nasty things.

The big one is just enforce the laws—the laws on money laundering, the laws on know your customer, the laws on unlicensed securities, the laws on wash trading, and stuff like that. What happened, I think, is that the regulators were afraid of being accused of stifling innovation. But now that it’s clear that there was no innovation to stifle, they can actually regulate with without worry.

And finally, there are technical vulnerabilities. With a fairly small amount of money, you could probably make a cryptocurrency system provably unusable. As an attacker, you spam the system, lock out normal transactions, and you keep up the spam game until they start installing spam filters. And then what you do is you train your spam not to get around the spam filters, but to have the spam filters cause false positives. How well would a cryptocurrency work if one percent of the legit transactions got randomly stopped in spam filters?

Given all these these scenarios you’ve laid out, what’s your prediction? Ten years from now, are we still going to have cryptocurrencies?

Probably not. Because the thing is, the volatile cryptocurrencies don’t work for electronic payments. And we already have electronic money; we’ve had it for decades now. And there might be some in the future out on the fringes, but I don’t think we’ll ever see a return to the mania we saw a year ago.

So you’re bearish to the extreme.

But at the same time, I do not have any financial position in anything regarding cryptocurrency, for two reasons. First of all, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. And the other thing is there’s no reliable counterparties for out of the money options where you can bet on a collapse safely. So the only winning move is not to play.

As previously reported, the Bhardwaj brothers had been arrested on April 4, 2018 for allegedly defrauding around 8,000 investors out of ₹2,000 crores (about $300 million) via the GainBitcoin scheme, which they co-founded in 2013. Speaking of the Supreme Court’s latest decision, Bhardwaj’s lawyer, Deepak Prakash, has reportedly clarified that:

“While Amit Bhardwaj has been granted interim bail based on his health ground, the Supreme Court granted bail to his brother, purely based on the merits of the case.”

A decision on the brothers’ further request — that the court cancel all 12 existing cases listed against them across multiple states in India — has been deferred until a later Supreme Court hearing, reportedly likely to be held on April 27.

Moreover, Inc42 reports that Amit Bhardwaj’s hearing at the Supreme Court has now been delayed until April 22, having initially been set for April 2. A lawyer representing Nisha Raisoni — one of the petitioners against Amit Bhardwaj — reportedly stated that the matter had not come up for hearing at the originally intended date.

Inc42 notes that not only the the Bhardwaj brothers, but also three other suspects — Ayush Varshney, Rupesh Singh and Sanchit — have all succeeded in having their interim bail requests approved to date.

In regard to three founders whose startup, Darwin Lab, is alleged to have taken a 20 percent cut from Bhardwaj’s scheme, Inc24 reports that two of the three, Sahil Baghla And Nikunj Jain, have been in jail for the past eleven months. The third, Ayush Varshney, was reportedly never arrested and was later granted interim relief by the Bombay High Court.

As Cointelegraph has previously reported, the Bhardwaj brothers’ scheme is alleged to have been a Ponzi scheme that guaranteed 10 percent monthly returns, a claim not realized by investors. It also issued its own MCAP token in an initial coin offering (ICO) that is considered fraudulent due to the company’s price manipulation.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-officials-consider-revision-of-existing-crypto-regulations,"South Korean officials are considering a revision of existing regulatory frameworks regarding digital currencies, local media outlet ZDNet Korea reported on April 4.

Speaking at the Deconomy conference in Seoul, top government officials reportedly stated that the country has to re-evaluate cryptocurrency policies in order to facilitate the growth and maturity of the cryptocurrency market. One official outlined the importance of creating a place where the industry, financial institutions, and government-related organizations could communicate and jointly develop relevant guidelines. Song Hee-kyong, co-president of the 4th Industry Forum of the National Assembly, said:

""The government has misunderstood the virtual currency and tried to meet the real currency standards, so there are various problems.The industry does not stand still while waiting for the regulatory sandbox authorization, so it is just like keeping it in the box.""

Lawmakers reportedly confirmed their willingness to promote the blockchain industry, although Jung Byung-kook, chairman of the 4th Industry Special Committee of the National Assembly, stressed that the government should remain cautious and have a conservative approach to the technology in terms of its management.

South Korea banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September of last year, claiming that the practice of raising funds through the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens was almost “a gamble.”

This January, the country said that it will keep the ban, as the Financial Services Commission had discovered that firms conducting ICOs were making use of foreign jurisdictions, but still raising funds from South Korean nationals.

In early March, the South Korean Supreme Prosecutors' Office (SPO) established a task force to fight cryptocurrency-related fraud and crimes. The task force will be responsible for the investigation — under the SPO’s authority — of fraud, illegal money laundering and other illegal activities in the fields of fintech and cryptocurrency.",,https://cryptoslate.com/how-some-traders-avoid-bitcoin-taxes-using-crypto-loans/,"Some traders are using cryptocurrency as collateral to secure loans, allowing them to keep their bitcoin and get cash while avoiding capital gains tax. Due to the popularity of the option, the crypto loan industry has been growing rapidly.

Crypto Loans and Tax Implications

The ups and downs that have been synonymous with the crypto market ever since its inception don’t seem to affect the lending industry. According to a report from Bloomberg, there has been a steady increase in the number of people using various cryptocurrencies, primarily bitcoin and ether, as collateral to borrow money.

The Apr. 2nd report pointed to Edgar Fernandez, a former Wall Street trader who used some of his Bitcoin as collateral to borrow nearly $100,000. The move allowed him to keep his cryptocurrency without needing to pay capital gains tax on the newly acquired cash, potentially giving the trader more options to trade on margin (by purchasing more cryptocurrency) or pay off higher-interest debt.

This is due to the fact that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the US sees digital coins as capital assets (or in some cases commodities) like stocks and property, not as currency. Cryptocurrency lenders also are not subject to the same level of oversight by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

In the US, this is also important when waiting for long-term capital gains to apply to an asset. If a trader holds their bitcoin for a year or more, then they are eligible for the substantially lower long-term capital gains rate instead of getting taxed at the short-term capital gains rate.

The critical factor: using loans (likely) does not reset the waiting period for long-term capital gains, allowing savvy investors to access the cash locked up in their investment.

Typically, lenders require 20 to 60 percent more cryptocurrency as collateral to protect them against crypto’s volatility. Loan amounts range anywhere from $500 to $2 million with durations as long as a year, with interest rates varying from a few percentage points to 16 percent, the report found.

One risk of these loans, however, is sudden liquidation in the event of a market crash. If the underlying cryptocurrency suddenly becomes less valuable, then part of the crypto is liquidated in a margin call to maintain the ratio of collateral to debt.

Cryptocurrency Lending is a ‘Wild West’

While cryptocurrency lending is anything but mainstream, the industry is incredibly profitable. Genesis Capital, an affiliate at Genesis Trading, said it handed out more than $1.1 billion in cash loans against cryptocurrencies in 2018 alone.

The Jersey city-based cryptocurrency lender said its total volume doubled in the last quarter of 2018 compared to its previous two quarters.

However, despite an increased number of transaction, many experts call the digital-currency lending world a “Wild West.” Limited oversight of the industry (and a number of dubious overseas options) has left many concerned about the potential for bad actors in the sector.

Yet, these risks have not stopped demand. Many seemingly “large” crypto lenders have popped out of nowhere, including BlockFi, Compound Finance, SALT Lending, and others.

Many of these lenders have sprawling overseas ‘affiliates,’ and can sometimes be opaque about where or how they store a borrower’s digital currency—important details considering the prevalence of hacking, Bloomberg said.

Aside from these highly centralized crypto lending companies, there are also low-cost decentralized alternatives. One of those lenders, MakerDAO, is a decentralized autonomous organization that uses a series of smart contracts, in conjunction with oracles, to allow Ethereum holders to borrow up to 60 percent of the value of their ETH at an APR of 7.5 percent.

Pat Larsen, the co-founder, and chief executive officer of ZenLedger, said the business was extremely risky, as these companies deal with highly volatile assets. That said, if a bitcoin holder needs to pay off debt but doesn’t want to sell—or wants to wait for long-term capital gains to kick in—then a loan is an option worth considering.

How to make money trading cryptocurrency

Writing about how to make money trading cryptocurrency in 2019 looks a lot different from the years before. ICOs have all but died out, raising just $43mn in funds in March this year – down from their highs of $1.74bn.

token funding is trending toward zero, via @fundstrat pic.twitter.com/XTqaT29LuL — Rebecca Ungarino (@ungarino) March 17, 2019

Making money in cryptocurrency was relatively easy when the markets were all going up. You just invested in the right ICO or got in early on an altcoin and watched the massive gains.

Some of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin managed to earn a staggering 4,057,900% return on their investment when BTC sold for just $31 per unit. Imagine that return at the current price or the price it reached during its peak in December 2017!

Bitcoin and altcoin millionaires were being made overnight. But, these days, the landscape has changed. Making money on cryptocurrency has generally turned into a long game.

So if you can’t make a huge profit quickly anymore, the question of how to make money trading cryptocurrency remains. Here are a few tips.

Get in early

Many traders made huge profits by purchasing assets at their initial ICO value and selling them just days or even hours afterwards. These opportunities are few and far between today.

However, buying low and selling high is the rule among all asset traders and applies to trading cryptocurrencies as well.

Remember that no one knows for sure if Bitcoin’s price has bottomed out and whether the bull run will continue – or if buying now means you’ll get in just before another drop.

Cryptocurrency is still so new and there are few indicators of how much longer the bear market conditions will remain. So, as with any other investment, never trade more than you’re prepared to lose.

Stay up to date

Even missing one day of the action in the cryptocurrency arena can mean losing out on price spikes.

To make money trading cryptocurrency, you have to stay in the game every day. If that’s around the clock, so much the better. Cryptocurrencies never sleep.

Clearly you’re only human and sleep will be vital to your state of mind. However, you can use trading bots to help which you can set to follow automated rules. This means that you won’t have to miss out on a buy order you would have executed if you were awake, or end up with a big losing position.

Bots or not, make sure you stay up to date and follow forums, industry media, and social media like Telegram and Reddit, and know the updates and announcements that will likely make a coin or token pop in price.

Often, an upcoming launch, a new development, a hard fork, or an exchange listing are all events that can make the price increase.

Try day trading

Day trading can be split into several categories, the two main ones being spot and margin trading.

Spot trading is the most common type and involves trying to make money on your asset by trading it for another, hoping the asset makes gains.

For example, you could sell ETH, buy BNB, wait for the BNB asset to appreciate, and then withdraw the funds you put in.

You can do this on all major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, and even Coinbase, although the fees on the latter are much higher. You can also make money by using arbitrage, which is the difference in price listing between one exchange and another.

So, for example, if LTC is listed cheaper on one exchange and higher on another, using arbitrage will allow you to take advantage of the minor deviation in price.

Margin trading is increasingly available on exchanges as well, with the most notable being BitMEX. Margin trading basically lets you borrow money (called leverage) for a fee. Some exchanges offer up to 100x leverage.

This means that you can trade cryptocurrency with 100 times more than you have put behind it. If you’re successful, you can rake in a huge profit. If you’re not, it can put you in a catastrophic losing (or ‘liquidated’) position.

Learn to trade futures

Several cryptocurrency futures exchanges will let you try your hand at trading futures contracts. This works in the form of a contract between buyer and seller that specifies the exchange of the underlying cryptocurrency asset at a predetermined price on a future date.

You can either go “long” or go “short” on futures. Going long means that you agree to buy the asset in the future, and going short means that you agree to sell it.

Futures trading can provide a way to make money trading cryptocurrency even in a bear market when the price of BTC falls.

By “shorting” Bitcoin, traders essentially believe that the price will fall and enter the agreement to sell at the previously secured higher BTC price.

If they’re right, they can make a profit when the price drops based on their prediction. If they’re wrong and the price rises, they must sell the underlying asset for a devalued price.

The takeaway

So, how do you make money trading cryptocurrency? It isn’t an exact science and there are certainly no guarantees. As the (slightly bizarre) saying goes, there’s more than one way to skin a cat.

How you choose to trade in cryptos (and which ones) is ultimately up to you. Just be sure to carry out as much research as you can and understand that a winning streak can easily be followed by a fall.",2019-04-05 08:00:26+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cumberland-crypto-otc-desk-reports-spike-in-large-scale-btc-trades-within-one-hour,"Cumberland, the Chicago-based cryptocurrency trading unit of DRW Holdings LLC, reported a sharp, sudden spike in large-scale Bitcoin (BTC) transactions the evening of Monday, April 1. The company revealed the data in a tweet on April 4.

The series of thirteen orders that the trading desk tracked all exceeded 1,000 BTC (about $4.9 million at press time). Cumberland — which has been operating an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading desk since 2014 — noted in the tweet that:

“The post-trade analysis of Monday evening’s price action revealed a series of large bids (>1,000 BTC per order) within a 1 hour span, which appear to be actual buyers vs. forced liquidations.”

In a follow-up to the tweet, Cumberland’s Global Head of Trading, Bobby Cho, clarified that the data represented “executed, economically binding trades.”

In a separate update on Twitter earlier this week, Cumberland tweeted that Bitcoin had “moved more than 10% for the first time in 8 weeks,” stating:

“We are watching for $5,000 (the next even number) and $5,500-$5,800 (strong resistance points which have previously caused several uptrend and downtrend selloffs to and from $20,000).”

Cryptocurrency markets have this week reported their first bullish uptick of 2019, with Bitcoin beginning a sharp rally overnight April 1-April 2, gaining 14 percent in about an hour to push over $4,500 for the first time this year. The coin then broke above the $5,000 mark on April 3.

Google Trends data indicated that searches for ""Bitcoin"" almost tripled in response to this week’s positive price action.

Armstrong made his claim during a live ask-me-anything (AMA) session on April 2.

Armstrong ran the 45-minute AMA on Tuesday, answering selected questions submitted by the crypto community. Addressing the first question, on the potential for mass crypto adoption, Coinbase’s CEO said that a cryptocurrency can achieve mass adoption by improving scalability and usability, while reducing volatility.

As per volatility, if the crypto markets keep swinging dramatically, it will be hard to get more traditional investors involved, Armstrong said. Thus the industry needs more stable prices, achieved, for example, via stablecoins, and more use cases to attract people, he concluded.

Armstrong further added that there are currently up to ten teams working on scalability solutions, such as the Lightning Network, to improve the speed of crypto transactions. Thanks to the development of these solutions, cryptocurrencies might reach 500 to 5000 transactions per second and start working at Visa and PayPal volumes.

Usability also needs to be improved, Armstrong continued. He argued that currently there are too many steps a user needs to make in order to invest in cryptocurrencies. Armstrong suggested crypto investment for retail investors should work much easily, using popular Chinese app WeChat as an example of usability.

Armstrong also commented on recent skepticism towards Coinbase in the community, evidently referring to the most recent #DeleteCoinbase movement as an example. The campaign was launched in early March as a response to Coinbase’s acquisition of a firm run by former spyware developers.

Answering another question, the entrepreneur said he loves Bitcoin (BTC) and wants it to succeed. However, he regrets being too involved in promoting BTC at some point in 2013-2014, thinking that the coin could become a scalable payment network for everyone. “I totally underestimated how controversial this idea might become in BTC community,” he confessed.

As some accused him of adding the value to the coin, Armstrong finally changed his mind to being agnostic to all of the coins and crypto protocols and support them all. Coinbase decided to support everyone instead of picking the winners, he said.



As Cointelegraph previously reported, Armstrong has repeatedly acknowledged his affection towards BTC. For instance, in a series of tweets commemorating on the coin’s 10th birthday this year, Armstrong wrote that BTC was his “first love.”",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-makes-linkedins-top-companies-2019-list-as-lone-crypto-firm,"United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the only cryptocurrency business to make it into LinkedIn’s list of the most popular companies for 2019, results confirmed on April 3.

The yearly rundown, which ranks company popularity among employees, placed Coinbase at 35 out of a total of 50 shortlisted.

LinkedIn ranks contenders according to interest in the company, employee engagement by executives, demand for available jobs and employee retention rate. Different lists are issued for different countries, with Coinbase correspondingly appearing in the U.S. edition.

The exchange has previously made it onto LinkedIn lists, such as in September last year, when it appeared in a rundown of the top 50 startups to work for, alongside payment network Ripple and fellow trading platform Gemini, the product of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

The latest data contains some surprises — Coinbase beat out famously crypto-skeptical JPMorgan Chase, which only attained 44th position.

Twitter and Intel also failed to top Coinbase. The former has recently shown an increasingly pro-crypto stance and the latter has engaged in mining hardware activities as of last year.

For its part, JPMorgan CHas has also begun experimenting with cryptocurrency technology, Cointelegraph reporting last month on the unexpected release of its controversial in-house token, JPM Coin.

The exchange plans potential roles for its new “eCAD” token in cross-border payments and remittance, peer-to-peer lending, merchant payment solutions, as well as trade settlements and forex conversions.

Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond said in an announcement Thursday:

“The launch of eCAD will create the first transparent, affordable, and secure way of transferring value in Canada and beyond, without the risk of instability in the traditional cryptocurrency market.”

The firm pledged that each eCAD token will have one Canadian dollar backing it in reserve. While it claimed transparency in the announcement, it did not detail if and how proof of its reserves might be made public.

The news follows Coinsquare’s recent acquisition of decentralized exchange (DEX) StellarX for an undisclosed amount. StellarX is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Coinsquare and is based in Bermuda.

Coinsquare is backed by financial services firm Canaccord Genuity, having raised $30 million in equity financing back in early 2018. The funding, the exchange said at the time, “will be used to fuel a global growth plan and diversification strategy focused on making the platform even more responsive to mainstream customers’ needs.”

The platform was recently identified as a “low risk“ exchange by reg-tech startup Coinfirm, due to having licenses and strict know-your-customer (KYC)/anti-money laundering (AML) policies in place.

The launch comes amid something of a flood of stablecoin launches over the last year. Most recently, cryptocurrency startup TrustToken launched a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the British pound and crypto exchange Bittrex, along with five other blockchain firms, announced a euro-pegged stablecoin that can be staked to earn returns.

The oldest and still the most used stablecoin, tether (USDT), which has been controversial for its lack of independent audits of its reserves, recently announced that its collateral backing the token may not be 100 percent in U.S. dollars.

Digital assets, experimental crypto-economies, and the democratization of finance are fairly novel phenomena that, unlike other more traditional commodities, assets and their markets, don't have too long a historicity we can draw upon to apply technical analysis in any reliable, meaningful way. Nor do these innovation-driven markets-in-the-making directly lend themselves to the same rules and laws that govern other, traditional economies and markets. For example, entrepreneurs may be considered irrational or driven by extrarational motivations, according to standard economic theory, which often reduces economic agents to the homo economicus of the self-interested paper-clip maximizer.

McAfee ""influencing"" his followers and pumping up morale.

Despite all that, there's no shortage of loud voices in the cryptosphere: experts and forecasters, ""Wall Street veterans"" turned ""Bitcoin maximalists"", advisors and advertisers, social media and youtube ""influencers"", celebrity endorsements, rumors sold as news, and exaggerated, unrealistic expectations. In all the media pollution, it's difficult to distinguish the signal from the noise, even less so to get a clear picture of the landscape as it is -- without the hype and hyperbole, terminological obscurantism and self-serving disinformation, the charlatanry of the snake oil merchants and the inflated enthusiasm of a pump and dump operation, vulgarly justifying unethical behavior by calling it laissez-faire business.

So, in such circumstances, it's always useful to hear what some established authorities in their domains (to which they have dedicated their life's work) have to say on the matter. Regardless of whether or not it appeals to what we want to hear or whether we agree or not. Without a doubt, crypto-economies are an unusual phenomenon born from a combination of unusual circumstances and are highly experimental and multi-disciplinary in nature, so it's impossible to exhaust their potential and possibilities within a single conclusion, but we should also bear in mind the space and territories these economies occupy and not attribute properties to them without considering the interdependencies and power relations involved.

How the corporate-dominated Web 2.0 and the advertising and curation (as Google is more of a curation engine than it is a search engine) techniques it has established give rise, in turn, to flawed business models and the creation of false impressions. See also: David Graeber's new book, ""Bullshit Jobs: A Theory""

Few people's opinions and analyses are as valued in as many circles (when it comes to monetary history, econometrics and economic forecasting) as that of Martin Armstrong, a well-known economic forecaster and institutional advisor active since the 1970's who incorporates machine learning and AI techniques (fancy terms for computerized statistics on steroids) in conjunction with mathematical models and extensive historical databases that trace the monetary, economic, and political history of the world (going way back, recording all major turns and events known since ancient times), to reveal global and long-term trends and correlations between markets, institutions, governments, investors, and geopolitics, etc. Armstrong's comprehensive methodology combined with all the data of accumulated experience is meant to provide the means for reliably recognizing events as they begin to gather up momentum by identifying subtle signs and patterns of behavior and then approximating the point at which they would eventually unfold.

His approach actively tracks global capital flows alongside all kinds of markets, instruments, and indices, correlating phenomena to the circumstances that have historically given rise to them. Armstrong has made many eerily on-the-spot forecasts and known to have accurately predicted major global economic events since the 1970s. A documentary about his life and work was released in 2014, called ""The Forecaster"".

Psychohistory, Isaac Asimov and ""The Foundation""

Armstrong has on occasion been likened to Hari Seldon, the fictional mathematician from Asimov's famous ""The Foundation"" who dedicated his life to developing a branch of mathematics known as psychohistory (a concept of mathematical sociology) and who could forecast the future, but only on a large scale. In ""The Foundation"" Seldon foresees the inevitable fall of the Galactic Empire followed by dark ages lasting for tens of thousands of years but shows a way to significantly reduce that interval until another great empire arises. Similarly, Armstrong often tends to draw on Hume's guillotine to point out the inevitability of historical processes and our ignorance and epistemic arrogance in dealing with systems as complex as the world economy (regardless how noble our intentions), prioritizing how we can intelligently adapt to the nature of things and minimize unwanted consequences instead of vainly trying to fight with natural laws and forces we can't predictably control.

The Economic Confidence Model (ECM), Socrates and ""Understanding the Real Economy""

Armstrong's model marked in advance the exact day of the 1987 October crash. Later, in an essay called ""Understanding the Real Economy"", he wrote that,

[He] never did expect this to work on such a precise time level. [Explaining further that he] spent a lot of time trying to comprehend how such a model can even work on a specific level to a precise day, years and decades in advance, [and that] the only explanation is the subject matter is so intensely complex that there is indeed a hidden order within what would appear to be random chaos.

The New Yorker dedicated a lengthy piece on Armstrong and his method in a 2009 article, ""The Secret Cycle"":

He had clients and offices overseas, and cultivated connections with central bankers, and with Margaret Thatcher. It was more sensible to suggest that his models, among them one called a Panic Cycle Model, which spotted big reversal days, were rooted in certain fundamentals and complex computer calculations, rather than in a simple mystical number.

The basis of his Economic Confidence Model (ECM) is grounded in the view that,

everything is connected in an intricate dynamic non-linear network where the slightest change in one region can set in motion a ripple effect of dramatic proportions around the world. Understanding this dynamic non-linear global network is the first step in restructuring government and our idea of managing our political-social-economy.

The Lorenz attractor is a system notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system (a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Lorenz) which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight. Lorenz first described the behavior of deterministic chaos (i.e., systems whose deterministic nature does not make them predictable, which is different from a purely random stochastic process) which led to the formalization of chaos theory in the 1980s. Martin Armstrong makes extensive use of models and notions from chaos theory in his models and methodologies. Chaos theory studies non-linear complex systems where small changes in parameter values result in unpredictable, qualitative changes in the system (e.g., the famous tale of the butterfly flapping its wings, causing a tsunami in the other end of the world). Bifurcations, for instance, model the quantitative or topological changes in the structure of a given family (such as changes in the qualitative structure of a dynamic system that is non-linear).

The model does not track individual markets in isolation, but the global phenomenon of international capital flows, as already mentioned. Each market retains its own cycle and rhythms and capital tends to concentrate into a single region and then into a single market, causing a bubble to form. When a market cycle correlates with the ECM, this alignment then unfolds the series of events leading to booms and busts.

Socrates is the platform incorporating Armstrong's models, proprietary algorithms, databases and methodologies used to research and interpret the global economic and political environment.

Socrates considers all potential economic and social variables by gathering data on everything from stocks, bonds, interest rates, and commodities to political trends, wars, and civil unrest. Socrates monitors nearly every currency in circulation to grasp a truly global perspective of the global economy. Most importantly, Socrates generates analyses without human intervention. This ensures that our analyses are non-subjective by removing the bias of personal observation. -- From ""Models and Methodologies, 2nd Edition"", describing the models and methods employed by Armstrong.

Cliodynamics and Seshat, The Global History Databank

Armstrong's trans-disciplinary, facts-grounded and computer-driven approach is very similar to the one that has been employed in a related area of academic research known as cliodynamics since the early 2000s. Cliodynamics is defined as ""a transdisciplinary area of research integrating cultural evolution, economic history/cliometrics, macrosociology, the mathematical modeling of historical processes during the longue durée, and the construction and analysis of historical databases"", treating history as a science and developing theories that explain such processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, spread and disappearance of religions, etc. These theories are translated into mathematical models which are then tested against data.

""Quantitative historical analysis uncovers a single dimension of complexity that structures global variation."" A publication by cliodynamics researcher and population biologist Peter Turchin. The above diagram illustrates some of the categories of variables involved.

Thus, the building and analyzing of massive databases of structured historical and archaeological information is one of the most important goals of the discipline and the construction of Seshat, the global history databank, is an undertaking central to cliodynamics. Founded in 2011, it aims to ""bring together the most current and comprehensive body of knowledge about human history in one place"", claiming that ""the huge potential of this knowledge for testing theories about political and economic development has been largely untapped."" In the context of distributed crypto-economies, modern informational technology, and digital humanities, one could imagine something like Armstrong's Socrates built on top of Seshat in a more generalized manner and as a public service in the future (or otherwise ""transform the field of historical social sciences into what the sociologist Randall Collins termed rapid-discovery science"").

In any case, given Martin Armstrong's weight of experience and depth of understanding the dynamics of what drives the world market economy, it is interesting to see what he has to say about crypto-currencies and Bitcoin from the standpoint of his unique background and rich experience, which has led him to develop a sharp sense and intuition about the nature and function of the entities involved (states and their vassal governments, banking culture and politics, monetary policy and the Fed, etc.), the underlying motives driving their actions and how far certain actors are prepared to go in order to preserve their positions of power and influence. And, since we're on the subject, it is useful to actually provide the exact definition of what a ""state"" as a polity fundamentally is:

A state is a compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory. Source: Wikipedia.

Martin often reminds crypto enthusiasts and techno-libertarians that, after all, the state has all the police, armies, and tanks. Anyway, let's see what his view on crypto-currencies is and how they fit in the overall landscape of today's turbulent and chaotic world in the midst of a historical state transition.

""Crypto-currencies"" Are Neither Money Nor World Currencies, But Financial Instruments, Trading Vehicles, and Assets of Various Kinds

In a blog post entitled ""Have Cryptocurrencies Become a Religion?"" Armstrong writes:

If we are talking about simple Bitcoin as a trading vehicle, then fine. We added it to the Global Market Watch and Socrates because it is a tradable asset. It is really just like everything else that trades. Socrates called the high in Bitcoin simply because it complied with the trading patterns like everything else that is really not the asset, but how humans interact with that asset (Behavioural Economics). Its value is based upon ANTICIPATION and that need not be real, possible, and it may be outright impossible. If you believe in something you react according to your beliefs even if it is completely irrational. [...] Cryptocurrencies are trading vehicles. Cryptocurrencies will NEVER replace the dollar or world currencies. Do you really think governments will simply allow such a venture to take all their power away without a fight? Cryptocurrencies are worthless without a power grid. That is a disadvantage even to mackerel. That said, it does not stop Bitcoin from being a trading asset, but it is not money. It trades on a belief system of some that are completely irrational of which you will NEVER convince the majority to agree with them any more than they could with gold. [...] The monetary system will come to an end as we know it today. It will be replaced with an electronic reserve currency among nations. That will NOT be something that you use to go shopping with. I do not care what you call money. It is nothing more than a unit of account and a medium of exchange. It historically sits on the opposite side of assets. Bitcoin is still an asset – it is NOT money. If Bitcoin were money, then it would decline in purchasing power when assets rise.

Asked whether crypto-currencies would survive a monetary crisis, he explains:

The year 2018 was the start of the Monetary Crisis. We had a shot that this could all come undone in 2018. However, you are correct. All we achieved was a false rally with the Euro stopping just shy of our number and gold struggled admirably but could not get through 1362. There were many other markets also confirming that we are dealing with only the beginning of the crisis here in 2018 rather than the conclusion including the consolidation in the stock market without election any monthly bearish reversals. The monetary reset can arrive during the next window in time come 2021 if we get the dollar at new highs. Then the monetary system will crack. However, this could drag out to the third window which is of course 2032. That appears to be more the shift of the Financial Capital of the World to China at that time. These are the turning points. The Reversals are the key which confirms or denies the trend. My opinion as to the future is still an opinion. I will say this. As long as cryptocurrencies are an asset class, then they will survive a monetary crisis along with all other assets. Assets are the ONLY thing that survives the collapse of a currency. Tangible assets are on the opposite side of whatever the currency is in use. When the stock market rises, the purchasing power of the currency declines. When the stock market crashes, then the purchasing power of the currency rises. They are on OPPOSITE sides. Do you really want a cryptocurrency to be a currency or asset? Most people pitching them are really explaining an alternative asset – not a currency.

In another blog post, ""Are Cryptocurrencies A Fictional Dream?"", the question of the critical dependence on the electricity grid is raised:

There are a lot of problems with the technology and it would clearly make the entire economy vulnerable to a crisis in the failure of platforms or the power grid. Goldman Sachs sees the opportunity because of all the fraud. They are looking at stepping in as a CUSTODIAN because the integrity of the security behind a cryptocurrency is often questionable. In war, you target the electricity grid as a first objective and then the total economy would collapse as well as the effort to fund a war. During a war, governments have often counterfeited each other’s currency. The British did that with American colonial currency. If they could undermine the confidence and cause hyperinflation, then funding the war effort would collapse. Today, you would do this by hacking and targeting the power grid. In all the high-level meetings I have had about this technological innovation, the single greatest concern is would it make a nation more vulnerable during a war? Can a cyber attack simply paralyze the economy? Keep in mind that only about 4% of the economy takes place in cash. The rest is electronic deposits. Therefore, this threat is NOT limited to cryptocurrencies. It may very well be the next way to win a war. Attack the banking system and you will freeze the ability to fund a war. Don’t think they are not thinking about that right now.

Elsewhere he further explains:

Socrates picked the high in Bitcoin perfectly. How? Why? Very simple in fact. No matter what instrument you look at, the chart is not actually that instrument. It is a chart of HUMAN emotion relating TO THAT instrument. The chart of silver from 1980 is similar to that of Bitcoin. Back then, they were touting silver would go to $100. They swore it would do that any day for the next 19 years. We have people in Bitcoin swearing it is going to $100,000 and become the new reserve currency. That is such a joke for any currency to be worth that much would guarantee it cannot be used in commerce since most transactions are small. Then to be the reserve currency means governments would have to issue debt in Bitcoin. Come on! Are these claims even practical?

In yet another blog post, ""Can Cryptocurrencies Survive?"", Armstrong points out Bitcoin's utility as a back alley for siphoning cash and in money laundering operations (calling it “the biggest money laundering scam in Chinese history”, given its use in diverting capital out of China), pointing out the paradoxes implied in the notion that Bitcoin could constitute a world currency or a replacement of money and the current global financial system:

Bitcoin became the LEADING means of money laundering and movement of cash out of China, circumventing their rule of law and currency controls. So do not think for one minute that Bitcoin rose because it was really a wonderful idea? The government has the army, tanks, and the guns and soon robot soldiers. Until the army is willing to turn against the hand that feeds them, which is why they are developing robot soldiers, you cannot stand with cryptocurrency and claim some magical right to suppress government and central banks. You need the power grid! I have been skeptical about the claims that cryptocurrencies will replace all money and central banks and end banking creating money out of thin air. That would be recreating the Dark Age. For that to take place there can be no lending. The mortgage market would collapse and the value of the property would fall to less than 10% of its worth becomes the maximum someone has cash as was the case during the Great Depression. This hatred of central banks is stupid. The money they create is less than 10% of the money supply. The bulk is created through lending and fractional banking.

And more recently, on the absurdity of exaggerated claims about Bitcoin and IMF's recent report, ""Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currencies"":

There was no possible way governments would EVER hand over such power to Bitcoin. These people have no clue about the age of knowledge, for they are trapped in the age of stupidity. A monthly closing below 2950 will confirm the long-term trend is turning down. A year-end closing below 4150 will point to a drop back to 775 area. It was a trading vehicle – not an investment class for the long-term. With the IMF telling all central banks to create their own cryptocurrency and the introduction of Blockchain in experimenting with tax collection, we face a very different future due to technology. However, it will not be a world of free-market cryptos that bring governments to their knees.

He goes on to further explain the possible implications of the technology (blockchains and distributed ledgers) for the state actors, governments and financial institutions themselves:

With adopting cryptocurrencies that governments would control, we will come one step closer to losing all our freedom. Central banks could enforce negative interest rates with cryptocurrencies and thus people would find their accounts just garnished. You could not hoard cash and withdraw it from banks. They are also looking at this as a way to manage a banking crisis stopping runs on banks. This technology is also causing those in the hunting of tax revenues to lick their lips. The issuance of digital currencies would allow central banks to remain in control of the money supply far more so than they are today. Sweden is moving forward and there we see that the use of cash is rapidly disappearing. Cryptocurrency technology would allow also the taxman to just cometh and take whatever he desires in the midst of the economic crisis we face. The Central Banks would be able to maintain greater control over the creation of money through the process of leverage (bank lending).

In other words, as with any technology, it depends on what it is used for and by whom. As such, it can also be employed as an even more efficient instrument of capture and control. A possibility that many enthusiastic advocates and evangelists out there may not have given sufficient thought when calling for mass adoption (getting the ""moms and dads"" in, etc.) of highly experimental technologies in their early phases of inception.

To add to that, given the enormous waste of actual resource that fuels Bitcoin and the so-called proof-of-work network consensus at its current rate (more than what entire developed countries consume and more than twice that of gold and other precious metals), it doesn't sound realistic to assume it will become a ""world currency"" in any practically applicable way, nor a ""store of value"" given the volatility swings, general uncertainty, and long list of mishaps and flaws. No technology could in itself resolve issues that are fundamentally socio-economic in nature.

As for ""digital gold"", this is also something of an obvious misnomer - the only digital gold is that you find in computer games. So, it might also be useful to pay a little more attention to language and remind ourselves what a metaphor implies.

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Lessons from Socrates

Many trading systems and strategies are also ""trained"" on datasets, but the capacity to learn is limited to the extent and quality of the data (""garbage in-garbage out""), as well as the sets of machine learning (which is really at bottom another name for statistics) techniques applied and the extent to which they are adequately suited for the purpose at hand.

An excerpt from Armstrong's essay, ""Understanding the Real Economy""

Asked whether advances in quantum computing and various forms of cloud and edge computing could possibly match the predictive power of his models, Armstrong explains:

The long-term database is essential. That cost more than $100 million to assemble and quite frankly, nobody seems to be willing to spend that much. This is why all prior models have collapsed creating economic catastrophes such as Long-Term Capital Management debacle. They collapsed again in 2007. Nevertheless, then you have the problem of Neutral Nets are just incapable of handling the vast array of variables. The attempts to create trading models are all flat-model based. Our system has made so many accurate forecasts for so long on so many markets around the globe that I do not even comment on. It is far too much for me to even write about. That is the whole purpose of Socrates. I had to design a completely different programming technique to work out the complexity. Just image calculating every market in the world in 35 different currencies. The number of variables is beyond comprehension. If we are talking about a limited number of variables for normal business operations, Neural Nets are fine. When it comes to market forecasting, they can develop a Deep Learning system on a single market, but without correlating this with all other markets, you will NEVER see the contagion coming. When everything crashed in 1998 because of the collapse in the Russian debt markets, the illiquidity caused funds to sell other assets to raise cash to cover losses elsewhere. The Russian bond collapse caused a massive sell-off in Japanese yen/dollar rate that had absolutely NOTHING to do with the fundamentals in Japan. Contagions always emerge externally so you can create a model and it will work for a while and then you lose everything.

Armstrong has also written quite a bit on machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. He has throughout his experience worked out proprietary ML techniques developed for the purpose of fleshing out a comprehensive framework for managing and understanding the global economy in how it all fits together in the non-linear dynamics of things in motion, beyond the theoretical underpinnings of is-oughts.

Ask-Socrates: An Economic Forecasting AI and Software-as-a-Service

Socrates is currently undergoing major upgrades, adding another 9,000 instruments to the presently covered 1,000. Employing technical analysis, Socrates automatically writes reports and conclusions which progressively add to the wealth of recorded data. As Armstrong explains: ""The whole object here is to provide consistent analysis that is FREE from any human bias, conflict of interest, or personal opinion."" In line with the ambition of providing ""the best management tool for society moving into the future.""

The efficacy of Socrates is demonstrated by anecdotes such as the recent ""How Can Socrates Forecast The Biogen Crash Today?"" To the question of how Socrates could possibly know if an Alzheimer’s trial would get scrapped, Armstrong explains:

I believe it is the same thing as war. Someone knows they will invade in advance and take positions accordingly. Socrates seems to pick many things like this. Chances are, there were people inside who knew the truth and began to sell creating a pattern that Socrates picked up.

A 237 pages long discussion on Martin Armstrong at bitcointalk.org.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-wash-trading-sifting-facts-from-fears,"In mid-March, Bitwise Asset Management issued a damning report on Bitcoin (BTC) trading figures. The San Francisco-based index fund provider declared that up 95 percent of Bitcoin trading volume as seen on CoinMarketCap (CMC) was due to so-called wash trading.

Wash trading is a type of market manipulation where sell and buy orders are simultaneously placed on the same asset to create false and misleading trading activity in the market. Wash trading is illegal in regulated exchange platforms.

95 percent of BTC trading volume is fake

As part of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bitwise submitted a proposed rule change that included a report on the Bitcoin trading market. According to the report, 95 percent of the recorded BTC trading volume is due to wash trading by bots.

So, where CMC figures would show about $11 billion in daily BTC trading volume, the actual figure less wash trading would be about $470 million. For Bitwise, the problem comes from the fact that CMC and other similar platforms use fake data from obscure cryptocurrency exchange platforms.

The revelations from the Bitwise report on wash trading echo the findings of previous reports released by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) and Tie — a trading analytics platform. As reported by Cointelegraph, data from 97 exchanges show that 87 percent of cryptocurrency exchange volume was potentially false, according to Tie.

These revelations caused considerable debate among stakeholders in the industry. Critics of platforms like CMC were quick to point out the flaws in CMC’s metrics. Others also ignited the price manipulation debate and the impact of the overwhelming level of wash trading on BTC price discovery.

Is CMC to blame?

CMC is a cryptocurrency market data provider and is among the top-500 visited websites in the world. Trading volume figures on a platform as popular as CMC arguably play a major role in shaping market trading. Thus, there is a palpable concern about the effect of such inflated trading volumes on the market in general.

The data provided by CMC comes directly from exchanges listed on the websites. Some of these platforms domiciled in loosely regulated spheres are reportedly wont to inflate their trading figures to attain a higher position on the CMC ranking of exchange platforms by 24-hour trading volumes.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), CEO of Binance — one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the market — says that CMC isn’t solely to blame. According to Zhao:

“It’s not so much CoinMarketCap’s fault. Everyone tries to blame them, but CMC is a very simple reporting mechanism where every exchange reports their own data to it and they just show it.”

While CZ appears sympathetic toward CMC, others believe the platform is to blame. Ryan Selkis of Messari, another cryptocurrency market data provider, declared via his Twitter handle that CMC’s data is mostly wrong, and this includes market cap, circulating supply and, of course, trading volumes.

Selkis pointed to the supply readings for XLM and XRP as examples of false and misleading data on the CMC platform. For these two cryptocurrencies in particular, the significant treasuries held by institutions with strong affiliations to the tokens help to inflate their market capitalization values, thus earning higher rankings on CMC.

This incorrect data paints an exaggerated picture of the global cryptocurrency market that obscures the real size of the market. Given the sheer proportion of wash trading by bots, the effect of such a reality on the fidelity of the market becomes the next logical inquiry.

Effect of wash trading on price — market manipulation?

The fear of price manipulation is never far from Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Back in 2018, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began investigating claims of market manipulation in the market.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also initiated a separate investigation into the manipulation of BTC and Ethereum (ETH) via wash trading and spoofing. So, then is the ongoing high volume of wash trading significantly impacting the prices of cryptocurrencies?

Commenting on the issue in an email, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital — a cryptocurrency hedge fund — opined:

“If 95% of CMC’s BTC trading volume is fake, as per the report, it means market activity is being manipulated and the current price is not reflecting true market sentiment. However, as more reputable exchanges enter the space, this effect should diminish, since most of the ‘real’ trading is already taking place on well-known exchanges.”

Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, made the same conclusion in a recent market analysis article, saying on his blog:

“The key here is that all this wash trading that’s been discovered hasn’t actually affected the price of bitcoin itself in any meaningful way. In fact, if we focus only on the real 10 exchanges, we can see that this market is much more robust than previously perceived.”

According to Greenspan’s analysis and the Bitwise report, most of the market liquidity comes from 10 exchanges, even though there are hundreds of such platforms. Nine out of these 10 platforms are regulated, and the price of BTC displayed among them is fairly consistent.

So, if wash trading isn’t having a significant impact on price, why then is the practice this widespread? The answer probably lies in the attempts by these much smaller platforms to gain a larger share of the trading market.

By inflating their figures, they can rise up the CMC rankings. Such a situation gives them the opportunity to attract more users and charge higher listing fees.

How to Identify Fake Trading Volume

Some industry commentators have laid down numerous methodologies that could be used to identify fake trading volumes. Cointelegraph spoke with Joshua Frank, co-founder of Tie, who said comparing website viewership and trading volume was one of the easiest ways of identifying suspicious trading volumes.

According to Frank, the firm’s research showed a major distinction between those two metrics for “reputable platforms” and lesser known exchanges. Many of the exchanges suspected of wash trading routinely show figures like $400,000 in trading volume per view. Meanwhile, on well-known platforms, the figures are closer to $500-$600.

Frank also went on to state that the company decided to make the data available to the public via Google Sheets. The Tie co-founder said more experienced traders can also examine the trading history and order book of exchanges to spot suspicious trading data.

Since most exchange platforms are centralized, it is possible for them to inflate their figures by trading the same cryptocurrencies between a pair of bot accounts repeatedly. This gives rise to false high-volume figures that create the appearance of high liquidity.

Solving the Problem of Fake Trading Volume

In the wake of revelation from Bitwise, several stakeholders have proposed solutions to the fake trading volume problem. For CMC, the first step would be to improve the way it presents market data to users. In an email to Cointelegraph, the company noted:

“In an open ecosystem like the one we are in; we believe that the best policy — one that we follow closely — is to over-provide on data and let users make their own informed choices about what to do with that data.”

Already, Messari has taken steps to display extra information that offers up more insight into the reliability of trading volume figures. The platform included a new column on its website called the “Real 10 Volume.”

This new metric displays the 24-hour trading volume obtained from the 10 cryptocurrency exchanges found not to be involved in wash trading by the Bitwise report. The platform also announced that it would collaborate with these reputable exchanges to further improve the quality of its market data.

Messari’s approach with the “Real 10 Volume” seems to tie in with CMC’s sentiments about over-providing data. It is then left up to the trader to use the different metrics available as gauges for determining what is real and what is fake.

Carylyne Chan, the global marketing chief at CMC, made similar remarks in an interview with Bloomberg, saying:

“For instance, if an exchange with low traffic has $300M volume and just 5 BTC in its wallet, users will be able to draw their own conclusions without the need for us to make arbitrary judgment calls on what is ’good’ or ’bad.’”

For CZ, there is a need for greater transparency in the industry to eliminate such problems. The Binance chief also believes that CMC can use its considerable influence to encourage ethical behavior among listed exchange platforms.

Being a top-500 website on the Alexa rankings, most exchange platforms depend on CMC for referral traffic. CZ states that CMC can impose fines and suspend the listing of platforms that engage in unethical practices. Whether that — and more scrutiny — will be enough to curb the practice remains to be seen.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/installing-a-subdermal-bitcoin-wallet-is-only-for-the-brave/,"Installing a Subdermal Bitcoin Wallet Is Only for the Brave

In 2014, Dutch entrepreneur Martijn Wismeijer made headlines by having a pair of bitcoin wallets embedded under his skin. Since then, various cypherpunks and tech journalists have had microchips embedded into their hands. Anyone interested in getting ‘chipped,’ for the purposes of boasting a bio-implanted bitcoin wallet, should be cautious however, as the procedure is not for the faint-hearted.

Bitcoin Wallets Under the Skin

The idea of getting an integrated circuit device or radio-frequency identification (RFID) transponder embedded into your skin probably seems alien. It’s not without its advocates however; over the years various cryptocurrency enthusiasts have engaged in bio-hacking by embedding a microchip with a bitcoin wallet into their hand. On March 15, journalist Bailey Reutzel recently wrote how she got the “Mark of the Beast” and explained how it would now hold her bitcoin. Reutzel said she was inspired when she first met Martijn Wismeijer, otherwise known as ‘Mr. Bitcoin.’

In 2014, numerous media outlets reported on Wismeijer’s bitcoin wallets embedded into each of his hands. The two wallets were NFC Type 2 compliant chipsets for cold storage and hot wallet use as well. In 2016, Buzzfeed reporter Charlie Warzel described how he got a bitcoin wallet implanted into his hand in “What the Mark of the Beast taught me about the future of money.”

You may be curious to learn who supplies these microchips, how the procedure is done, and how much it costs to get ‘chipped.’ One of the most popular suppliers of bio implantable chips, Dangerous Things, estimates that the number of individuals who have been chipped stands at around 100,000. Dangerous Things believes “biohacking is the next phase of human evolution.”

The company sells several bio-chips including the Vivokey spark ($134), XDF2 Desfire ($139), Xnt NFC chip ($99-173), Flexnt ($149), and the Vivokey Flex one ($1,000). Dangerous Things and even Vivokey’s website emphasizes that these chips should be installed by a professional. A quick Google search will show bio-hacking professionals and piercing studios that will install the microchips. For instance, one could go to the Calm Body Modification clinic in Stockholm to get a subdermal implant.

Bio-Chips and Implant Procedures Can Cost Between $600-$2,500 Per Chip

Dangerous Things also sells bundle packs with other types of accessories that form an entire cyborg transformation kit. Older bio-chips are typically the size of a grain of rice and are usually encased in silicate glass, but over the last two years, more flexible versions have appeared on the market. Besides the ability to keep a bitcoin wallet under the skin, subdermal bio-chips can contain all types of information including a unique ID number, personal identification, medical files, and contact information.

Other than Dangerous Things, people can also purchase bio-chips from companies like Digiwell and Ksec Solutions. In addition to paying between $99-$1,000 for a typical silicate glass or flex chip, expect to pay another $500-$1,500 for the procedure. You can also find various shops that will undertake the bio-chip installation by searching one of the largest resources in the Body Modification Ezine.

Instead of dismissing the concept as weird, many people wholeheartedly believe the world will be guided by progressing futurism and humans will ultimately be connected with artificial intelligence. Some are convinced that bitcoin is part of this evolution into singularity and bio-chips that provide secure cryptographic payments will allow people to interact with the digital world like never before.

Starting April 15, residents can use cryptocurrency to pay their property taxes, but that’s not all. The town plans to expand the project to include all kinds of municipal services—from parking tickets, to swimming lessons, to getting a dog tag licence.

Innisfil is one of the first places in North America to allow residents to pay property taxes in Bitcoin. Joel Greenberg, a tax collector in Seminole, Florida, began accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash from everyday people to pay for municipal services, which he remits to the county in US dollars. The state of Ohio allows businesses to pay certain taxes using cryptocurrency, but not residents.

Because Innisfil is a small town and Bitcoin is still somewhat niche, the uptake isn’t expected to be huge, at least not at first. But that’s not the point.

“It allows us to develop our competency and our understanding around cryptocurrency and the blockchain and digitizing our services and our offerings to the public,” Innsifil Chief Administrative Officer Jason Reynar, who is overseeing the project’s implementation, told Motherboard over the phone. “We’re trying to create that smart citizen who is digitally literate.”

According to Reynar, this is a low-risk and low-cost gamble. To get the system up and running, the town simply redeployed a few current employees to work on it with Canadian payments processor Coinberry Pay.

Reynar was intrigued by the savings that a peer-to-peer system like Bitcoin could pass on to residents. Right now, if residents choose to pay online for municipal services using a credit card, they pay transaction fees ranging between 2.5 and four percent. On a tax payment of $1,000, that’s $40 in fees alone. By using Bitcoin, users are paying the processor 0.5 percent to transact—on a $1,000 payment that comes to $5 in fees.

Innisifil isn’t exactly a secret enclave of crypto users, but Coinberry CEO Andrei Poliakov says there are a surprising number of Bitcoin-savvy people there. “When I first got an in-person audience with staff this year, I was pleasantly surprised to find that out of the five people around the table, all five of them actually own crypto.”

Crucially, just because residents can pay their taxes in Bitcoin doesn’t mean the local government will be holding. The system is designed to minimize Innsifil’s exposure to Bitcoin’s notoriously volatile price swings. Coinberry Pay takes the payment in bitcoins and turns it into Canadian dollars, which is then deposited in the municipality’s bank account.

With the sudden and messy collapse of Canada’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, QuadrigaCX, still fresh in people’s minds, Reynar says projects like this make it easy for Bitcoiners or the crypto-curious to do something normal and safe with digital money—like paying taxes to the township.

This isn’t Innisfil’s first foray into headline-grabbing uses of new technology.

The town made headlines in 2017 when it began using Uber to provide public transit, instead of starting a bus line. The approach was criticized for leaving too much public responsibility in the hands of the fickle private sector, but residents seem pretty happy with it—a recent survey shows the satisfaction rate with the service at 70 percent. Based on the latest report on the project, the partnership with Uber saves the town millions of dollars annually compared to a bus service.

Like the Uber partnership, Reynar said he hopes that the cryptocurrency pilot will also snowball into something bigger in the future.

Poliakov told Motherboard that the township is laying down the infrastructure to be able to eventually accept other forms of cryptocurrency payments, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash.

“Our belief is that a hundred percent of the population will use some form of digital currency—I’m not saying it’s going to be Bitcoin—to transact in the future,” Poliakov says. “In order to allow people to spend their crypto, it’s like the chicken and the egg, which came first? You have to start somewhere.”",

This has raised a question in everyone’s mind - Is it too early to invest in cryptocurrencies?

Bitcoin turned ten on October 31st, 2018. The cryptocurrency has made headlines on multiple occasions that brought forth its unpredictable nature. Yet, the rise of Bitcoin has inspired the creation of thousands of other cryptocurrencies.

While every tech enthusiast and investor is interested in cryptocurrencies, they also continue to have mixed opinions about them. Amid the cryptocurrency scam epidemic, while David Yermack, the chairman of New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that cryptocurrencies are going to replace national currencies, Elon Musk has criticized the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency and their poor security protocols. So who is to be believed?

Vulnerabilities in Cryptocurrency

High Volatility

The price of Bitcoin suddenly rose to almost $20,000 and then dropped to $6,000. Due to such incidents, it is complicated for the investors to trust the ecosystem. Additionally, numerous people have no knowledge of how cryptocurrencies work, even if they own some. Thus, predicting the rise and fall in the value of cryptocurrencies is immensely complicated. Another risk of owning cryptocurrencies is that various new crypto-based companies can create their own currency only to create hype and to attract investors. But, after the investment, the price of the cryptocurrency drops, making the investor bear losses. Likewise, thousands of cryptocurrencies are made with the sole intention of scamming investors and eventually the currency dies. Hence, it becomes tricky for investors to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Low Scalability

Scalability is one of the most debated topics when it comes to the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency. At present, the infrastructure for cryptocurrencies is not quite mature. It is essential to understand the concept of scalability trilemma, to find the roots of the scalability problem.

The scalability trilemma states that cryptocurrencies can choose only two options between speed, decentralization, and security. The most popular cryptocurrencies, such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum, have selected decentralization and security. Hence, the speed of cryptocurrency transactions is painfully slow. When compared to giants like VISA, which can do 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin miners can only go for 3 to 7 transactions per second. Therefore, the slow transaction speed is highly responsible for blocking the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Absence of Regulations

Another major issue is that cryptocurrencies are not regulated at all, which makes it even harder for new investors to trust the system. In fact, a lot of people find the idea of investing in cryptocurrencies exciting, only because of the lack of any stringent regulation. We need some regulation to ensure that cryptocurrencies are used ethically and to observe stability in the cryptocurrency market. Strong regulations would only make crypto coins and tokens universally acceptable.

While some countries are making regulations for safer and efficient use of cryptocurrencies, others have absolutely banned cryptocurrencies, whereas the remaining countries have no interest at all. Regulation would reduce the vulnerability in cryptocurrency and facilitate the growth of blockchain in mainstream applications.

Liquidation Issues

Currently, every cryptocurrency in the market is illiquid. Hence, selling any assets without affecting the value of the currency is almost impossible for the investors. Investors can lose hundreds of dollars before they sell the currency.

Cybersecurity Concerns

Contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrencies are prone to cybersecurity breaches and hacks. For example, the Swiss blockchain company, Trade.io, has recently reported that crypto tokens worth almost $8 million have been stolen from their cold wallet. Similarly, multiple ICOs have faced issues with security breaches and hacking, which cost the investors hundreds of millions of dollars.

Another glaring issue in this regard comes from ransomware. Hackers are attacking various firms by encrypting their data and demanding a ransom in Bitcoin worth hundreds or thousands of dollars to decrypt the compromised data. In June 2017, Nayana, a South Korean web hosting organization had to pay around $1 million to decrypt the data of almost 3400 customers stored in 150 servers.

Solution

Although the ecosystem for cryptocurrencies is in its early stages, the existing obstacles can be tackled with practical solutions. To create a secure ecosystem, cryptocurrency owners should address the risks of cryptocurrencies. For starters, a global regulatory framework can be an excellent option to govern the application of cryptocurrencies. A union of multiple countries can come together to form a regulation model that is feasible for every economy. Another alternative is forming a self-governance model with the help of identity reputation. A self-governing model will help the ecosystem guide itself by regulating transactions based on the previous transactions of organizations and individuals. Better regulation can also solve the liquidation problem with cryptocurrencies.

Popular crypto coins are already working on their scalability. Bitcoin is developing a Bitcoin Lightning Network, where every investor has a dedicated node that is connected to at least one other node. The network aims to create a multi-signature wallet that correctly knows the owner of the currency and the receiver of the bitcoin. Such measures will effectively reduce the transaction costs and make the transactions faster. Similarly, Ethereum is planning to apply the process of blockchain sharding. The entire network is partitioned into sections called shards, and every shard will hold their own state and transaction history. With sharding, each node would process transactions for certain shards, instead of having a single network do all the work. This process will increase the rate at which transactions are processed collectively by the shards, assisting in speeding up the transactions. Likewise, other coins and tokens can adopt similar methods to address the scalability and vulnerability issues with cryptocurrency.

For overcoming the issue of volatility, the rise and fall in the value of cryptocurrencies need to be controlled. It is essential to understand that various factors affect the demand for crypto coins and tokens. Hence, a cryptocurrency project named Basis plans to maintain the value of cryptocurrencies by increasing and decreasing the supply of the currency, just like central banks. Similar options can be applied by other cryptocurrencies to address the volatility problem. Likewise, appropriate measures can be taken to tackle the other vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency, such as those related to cybersecurity. Hiring better security divisions with skilled cybersecurity professionals, who can implement a secure authentication mechanism and adopt web application security controls, should be the highest priority. Security officials need to conduct security training, and audit hardware and software regularly. Moreover, investors should avoid using cloud storage and storing private keys offline.

Implementation of Cryptocurrencies

Even though there are concerns regarding the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency, they can be adopted by organizations from various industries and sectors. Big players have realized that the benefits of cryptocurrencies outweigh the limitations, given the fact that the underlying technology is only getting more advanced. Hence, industry giants such as Virgin Galactic and Microsoft have already deployed cryptocurrencies in their organization.

By following their footsteps, cautious adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies will help any organization attain a competitive edge in the market. But, for successful deployment of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, business leaders, such as the CTOs and the CIOs, need to be thoroughly informed about every aspect of cryptocurrency. Moreover, finding out which problems can be fixed with cryptocurrencies is significant for strategizing its effective deployment. Hiring a team with niche skills can vastly improve the process of adoption and ensure better security standards. Before the implementation of cryptocurrencies, it is essential to guide the employees and explain how cryptocurrencies are going to affect the organization and the work culture.

With further developments in blockchain technology, the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency will eventually be taken care of. And, as finance and tech experts have pointed out, cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize finance, healthcare, technology, and various other market segments.",0001-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptoradar-finds-best-prices-across-exchanges-and-brokers/,"Cryptoradar Finds Best Prices Across Exchanges and Brokers

The number of stores that accept cryptocurrencies is rising in Slovenia and Croatia. Starting with merchants in one of the largest shopping and entertainment complexes in Europe, Elipay has now integrated with 300 stores in Slovenia and begun expanding into Croatia following approval by the country’s central bank.

300 Locations in Slovenia Including Bitcoin City

Cryptocurrency adoption has been rapidly growing in Slovenia. Elipay by startup Eligma is a crypto payment mobile app for iOS and Android devices. Many stores at one of the largest shopping and entertainment complexes in Europe, BTC City, have integrated Elipay which currently supports BCH, BTC, ETH, and ELI token.

Eligma CEO Dejan Roljic told news.Bitcoin.com Friday:

We have reached another Elipay milestone this week – 300 locations … About one third of them are in Bitcoin City.

Eligma describes Bitcoin City as “the result of infusing one of Central Europe’s largest and most important commercial, shopping and logistic areas, BTC City,” with cryptocurrencies and other innovations. There are over 500 shops in BTC City.

Nationwide, “The number of Elipay locations is constantly increasing,” Roljic remarked. “Elipay now covers most service and product categories: food and drinks, fashion, electronics, services, sports and leisure, entertainment, home and garden, toys and kids, pets, auto and moto, travel, adult, online stores, and other.” The latest addition, announced on April 5, was for Intaxi which allows taxi rides in and around the capital city to be paid for with cryptocurrencies.

Roljic further shared:

In addition to the use of crypto for shopping with the Elipay system, the Bank of Slovenia has also approved euro value to be added into Elipay by means of credit / debit cards and SEPA.

Expansion Into Croatia

Eligma has been working on its global expansion, starting with Croatia. “The Croatian National Bank has confirmed that Elipay can legally operate in Croatia,” the company tweeted on April 1.

Roljic explained to news.Bitcoin.com that after the central bank “confirmed the legality of Elipay operating in Croatia, the localization of the system started taking place,” emphasizing that it “will actually be completed in the course of next week.” He also revealed that his company is “already in contact with ERP [Enterprise Resource Planning software] providers as well as individual merchants and service providers, so that the first integrations can be expected as early as next month,” adding:

We will initially test and adjust the expansion model. In that phase, our goal is to enter the first 20 stores … If the testing is successful and a decision is made to fully expand throughout Croatia, then we anticipate that over 200 locations could integrate Elipay by the end of the year.

Billy, a major ERP and prospective payment system (PPS) provider in Croatia, is in the process of integrating Elipay into its system. Once completed, the system will “be tested and re-evaluated. This will be followed by a review of the technical documentation in order to prevent any potential issues with future updates,” the CEO described. Eligma has also been negotiating with another ERP provider in the country.

While the company has been conducting market research to establish which countries to expand into next, Roljic confirmed that further expansion “will only be initiated once the proof of concept on the Croatian model (MVP) has been brought to a successful conclusion.”

Need to calculate your bitcoin holdings? Check our tools section.",2019-04-06 12:50:47+00:00,https://www.ozy.com/the-new-and-the-next/can-her-black-powered-crypto-make-gurus-of-the-next-generation/93489/,"Several middle-school kids sit on gray upholstered office chairs around white tables, clacking away on their laptops, but with eyes sharply focused on the woman at the head of the class. A sea of black and brown faces, the children are enraptured by Tavonia Evans, as she teaches them how to use cryptocurrency — and how it can make them rich.

A two-decade tech entrepreneur and mother of eight, Evans, 44, spotted the potential for cryptocurrency early on. “When I first heard about bitcoin, I realized it meant financial freedom and additional sources of funding,” Evans says. But her plans were bigger than bitcoin — Evans wanted to launch her own cryptocurrency. And in 2017, she did. Ahead of its formal launch, Atlanta-based $GUAP — its name is drawn from urban slang for having a lot of money — has more than 2,500 wallet holders (users) on the platform and runs on its own blockchain. One $GUAP coin is currently listed at $44 and there are now just under 9 million coins in existence, out of a maximum total supply of 90 million. By comparison, there are approximately 17.6 million bitcoins in circulation (now priced around $5,000 each) and only 21 million that can ever be mined in total.

Evans believes that crypto is the key to increasing Black wealth in the U.S. African Americans are responsible for $1.2 trillion in purchases annually, according to Nielsen. But a 2009 research project known as The Empowerment Experiment found that less than 3 percent of Black purchasing power is spent on Black-owned businesses. Evans is out to change that by teaching both kids and adults how to increase their personal wealth with cryptocurrency, understand exactly where their money is going and use that knowledge to invest in Black-owned businesses.

Even if $GUAP isn’t around forever, teaching people how to use crypto is such a powerful tool, Evans says, that it will “help eradicate poverty within the next century.”

A New Yorker by birth, Evans grew up on Long Island in Amityville, of horror movie fame. She was positive she’d either be a lawyer or an actor — career aspirations that her mother, a caseworker with the city of New York, and her father, an artist, supported. “My parents came from an era where it was very difficult to be what they wanted,” Evans says, so they encouraged her to follow her own path. After attending Brooklyn Tech High School and then going to Central Georgia Technical College, she instead fell in love with the problem-solving nature of coding and the technology industry (her parents were cool with that too).

After moving south and getting an IT gig at Georgia State University in 2000, Evans worked as a web developer for software companies throughout the Atlanta area. In 2007, she launched a digital agency and development firm called She Interactive while continuing to work independently as a developer. Running a business came naturally to Evans, so she decided to keep going. In 2015, she co-founded Safe2Meet, an identity and background verification platform. But $GUAP was something different.

Evans realized the potential power of crypto but knew it would only work for her community if they knew how to use it. In the classes she teaches at AEI StartUp Factory just outside Atlanta in Lithonia, Georgia, Evans has different approaches by age group. “With children, I approach it from a gaming perspective,” she says. That’s what keeps them engaged. “With adults, I talk about how it builds worth,” she says. “Crypto is a game-changer because they [crypto owners] can support businesses in the community and actually see the results of it.”

The $GUAP platform collects and analyzes transaction information pulled from the blockchain so that users can see the growth of Black-owned businesses as well as understand potential financial risks. The currency will officially launch in May, after $GUAP’s point-of-sale infrastructure is complete. But it already has merchant partners on board, like Soultanicals, which sells natural hair care products.

Nathan Dillard, founder and CEO of National Black Business Directory (NBBD), a business solutions platform, partnered with Evans last year to bring blockchain to his platform. NBBD is integrating $GUAP’s blockchain technology into its business directory software, and business owners on the platform will accept $GUAP alongside traditional currency for products and services of equal value. By funding and circulating the currency throughout NBBD’s merchant network, it will encourage consumers to support community businesses, grassroots organizations and historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs), says Dillard. “$GUAP will be the cryptocurrency that gives back, not only ensuring consumers will save but that they will have access to funds to build and thrive.”

But the road ahead won’t be easy. “This is a fiercely competitive environment,” says David S. Bieri, associate professor of urban affairs and principal research associate for the Global Forum on Urban and Regional Resilience at Virginia Tech. “For all the promises of a grassroots revolution, in many instances, it is not entirely clear what the value proposition of a number of these cryptoassets really is,” he says. More importantly, Bieri says, there are still too many unknowns. “Cryptocurrencies are unlikely to satisfy the requirement of trust to make them sustainable forms of money.” For example, in 2017, the aggregate market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies increased by more than 3,200 percent. But bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, also underwent four drops in value of at least 20 percent within six months.

Evans agrees there is still too much mystery when it comes to crypto, but she’s aiming to change that. Even if $GUAP isn’t around forever, teaching people how to use crypto is such a powerful tool, Evans says, that it will “help eradicate poverty within the next century.”

It’s a bold claim, but for Evans, it’s written in the stars. Licensed in cardology, Evans sells readings in the study of the ancient science of playing cards, and she also offers astrology readings under the name Aquarius Maximus.

The inspiration for $GUAP originally came from a spiritual awakening that told her she needed to create another form of digital currency to empower the African diaspora.

Somehow, in between helming several businesses, teaching and reading the future, Evans finds time to spend with her eight children ranging in age from 8 to 24 — though having four out of the house now does make time management a little easier. “We love going to the movies and playing virtual reality (VR) video games,” says Evans, who raves about the Oculus Rift and the underestimated potential of VR.

If Evans has her way, $GUAP will expand internationally and cryptocurrency will be as ubiquitous as credit cards one day.

As long as she can convince the world it’s real money.

Karpeles, 33, is the former CEO of Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world.

“A year later,” Ogata says, “the police suddenly arrest you for breach of trust, don’t recover the stolen merchandise and let the criminal go free. That’s essentially what happened with Mt. Gox.”

In February 2014, Karpeles discovered the exchange was missing 850,000 bitcoins (around $480 million at the time). It didn’t take long for the information to become public, with Mt. Gox eventually filing for bankruptcy on Feb. 28.

At a news conference, Karpeles claimed the exchange had been hacked. He apologized and promised to recover the missing cryptocurrency. The cybercrimes unit of the Metropolitan Police Department launched an investigation into the matter and Karpeles offered to cooperate with the inquiry.

Naturally, those following the news have always wondered whether or not Mt. Gox had been hacked in the first place? Given the complexity of the issue, it was always going to be a difficult question to answer.

In 2015, agents from the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as members of Japan’s National Police Agency, met with Karpeles in Tokyo. They asked for Karpeles’ cooperation in an ongoing investigation involving an international hacker suspected of hacking several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitcoinica in 2012.

By August 2015, many assumed the police were going to arrest Karpeles for some reason or another. The special investigation unit that deals mainly with white-collar offenses had taken control of the case, suggesting that the Frenchman would be arrested in order to extract some kind of confession.

Karpeles, however, didn’t confess. The police subsequently arrested him on two other charges, with none of the indictments having any direct connection to hacking. Karpeles spent 11 months in detention before bail was granted.

“I was interrogated for eight hours each day,” Karpeles recalls. “I was asked about the missing bitcoins. I was even asked if I was Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. I was asked to sign confessions and statements in Japanese. Sometimes, the prosecutor would have pre-written statements for me in the morning they wanted signed.”

Kim Nilsson, a Swedish engineer who had lost 12 bitcoins in the collapse of Mt. Gox, began sharing information with federal authorities in the United States while Karpeles was in detention. They specifically analyzed the block chain, the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions.

In September 2016, U.S. authorities received a copy of the Mt. Gox database and used it to track the stolen bitcoins.

Tigran “Blockchain Wizard” Gambaryan, an agent in the Internal Revenue Service who has extensive experience in cryptocurrency crime, led a joint task force that looked into the case.

The task force concluded that Mt. Gox had been hacked by an outsider who had siphoned off more than 600,000 bitcoins in a period between 2011 and late 2013. It was able to trace the bulk of stolen bitcoins to one individual, a Russian bitcoin exchange operator named Alexander Vinnik.

On July 25, 2017, U.S. authorities had Vinnik detained in Greece. He was indicted on 21 counts of money laundering and several other charges, some relating to Mt. Gox.

During Karpeles’ trial in the Tokyo District Court, Ogata argued that Karpeles had only been detained because the police had hoped to extract a confession from him. When Ogata tried to enter Vinnik’s indictment into evidence, prosecutors objected, claiming the Russian should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The fallacy of such an argument was not lost on the panel of judges, who specifically referred to the indictment in their ruling.

On March 15, the court found Karpeles guilty of data manipulation and handed out a suspended prison sentence of 2½ years. He was found not guilty on a separate charge of embezzling millions of dollars through customer accounts. It’s perhaps just worth noting that the odds of a partial not guilty verdict in Japan after indictment are less than 1 percent.

Many domestic news organizations were muted in their coverage of the sentence that had been handed down.

The Nikkei Shimbun noted the indictments had nothing to do with the initial investigation of the hacking. “The Metropolitan Police Department investigation into the missing bitcoins has, in fact, been terminated,” the paper said.

Vinnik is expected to be extradited to France. And so it seems the man behind the Mt. Gox theft may have finally been identified. It’s a shame the domestic investigation into the case failed to add much to the end result.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The surge in Bitcoin on April 2 pulled most altcoins northwards. A number of altcoins soared, bringing back memories of the 2017 bull phase. Many altcoins outperformed Bitcoin, which shows that the market participants are accumulating the select beaten down cryptocurrencies at low prices.

Does this mark the end of the bear phase and the start of a new uptrend in cryptocurrencies? Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee certainly believes so. According to him, Bitcoin is now in a bull market. He said that the whales, some of whom had sold in 2018, have started to buy again.

In a tweet, the CME group revealed that Bitcoin futures hit a record volume of 22,500 contracts on April 4. The previous record volume was 18,300 contracts, which occurred on Feb. 19. This shows that shorts were forced to throw in the towel and aggressive bulls entered long positions.

The sharp rally from the bottom is a positive sign that indicates demand at lower levels. However, to confirm a bottom, most digital currencies will have to successfully retest the breakout levels and then resume their recovery. Until then, the risk of a double dip remains. We shall get a confirmation within the next few weeks.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned out to be the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The digital currency tends to rise vertically when the sentiment of the sector turns bullish. Recently, Crypto Facilities, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin Cash futures. The travel portal Bitcoin.Travel added support for Bitcoin Cash, bringing the total number of cryptocurrencies accepted to seven. Can the rally continue or will the digital currency again plunge towards the lows? Let us find out.

The BCH/USD pair traded in a tight weekly range for 11 weeks before skyrocketing higher. The sharp up-move has carried the pair above the 20-week EMA for the first time since May of last year. While the sharp up-move is a positive sign, failure to close (UTC time frame) the week with strength shows profit booking at higher levels.

This increases the probability of a minor consolidation or correction for the next couple of weeks as the bears try to reverse direction and sink the price back below $200 levels. However, if the price rebounds from the support zone of $265.14 to $241.97, a rally towards the 50-week SMA at $514 is possible in the medium-term.

LTC/USD

Even before the crypto rally began across the board, Litecoin (LTC) had increased about 101.22 percent in the first quarter, which shows that the traders had been gradually accumulating the cryptocurrency. The halving, expected to occur in early August, has also supported the rise. Swedish exchange Nordic Growth Market has listed exchange-traded products that track the value of Ripple and Litecoin, and these products will be available to European investors. Can the virtual currency continue its stellar run or will it hit a roadblock? Let us find out.

The LTC/USD pair has formed a rounding bottom pattern that will close on a breakout and weekly close above $91. The price has risen above both the moving averages, which is a bullish sign: it indicates a likely change in trend. The minimum target objective of the rounding bottom is $159. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to the next critical resistance of $175.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance at $91. In such a case, a few weeks of consolidation cannot be ruled out. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the prices sink below $62 once again.

Dash/USD

Dash (DASH) has made strong inroads in the crisis that hit Venezuela and is now attempting to increase its presence in Columbia. Latin American cryptocurrency exchange Daexs has added Dash, which will help investors buy the digital currency in the Colombian peso. Dash is slowly expanding its presence in Thailand as well, as about 100 Dash online transactions were recorded in March. The team is also trying to enter countries like Zimbabwe and Turkey where hyperinflation has increased the use case for cryptocurrencies. Let’s see how the market views these events.

After trading in a tight range of $56.214 to $103.261 for 16 weeks, the DASH/USD pair broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the range in the previous week. It has followed it up with a sharp up move this week. The pair has broken out of the 20-week EMA and is on target to reach the 50-week SMA at $176. Above this, the recovery can stretch to $224.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and plummets below $103.261. In such a case, a few more days of range bound action is possible.

NEO/USD

NEO rallied over 31 percent in the past seven days to emerge as the fourth-best performer among the major coins. There were no major events that caused the rise: every rally need not be preceded by a piece of news. In a bear market, the fundamental developments and the price appreciation happens with a lag. When the sentiment improves, the cryptocurrencies play catch up and price in the positives.

The NEO/USD pair had been stuck in a tight range of $5.48080-$10.00 for 17 weeks. It managed to close above the range in the previous week, but it could not scale the 20-week EMA. The sharp move up this week has propelled it above the 20-week EMA. It can now rally to $17 and if this level is crossed, it can move up to the 50-week SMA at $23.

The trend remains in favor of the bulls as long as the price sustains above $10. A successful retest of $10 will confirm that the downtrend is over and a bottom is in place. But if the pair breaks down below $10, it can result in a drop to the lows at $5.48080.

XEM/USD

The NEM foundation has launched the roadmap for the upcoming core engine release named Catapult. It promises to improve speed and scalability and bring in a number of new features hitherto unseen in any decentralized system. NEM will be accepted in a major convenience store and select shops in Taiwan through RapidZ payment system.

The XEM/USD pair is struggling to break out and close above the 20-week EMA. Unlike the other pairs, it is yet to stage a smart recovery from the lows. Even after the rally, it has only risen about 106 percent from the lows, which shows that the bulls have been slow to get into the pair. If the price turns down from the current levels, it can again drop towards the yearly lows.

But if the digital currency can rally and sustain above $0.07790717, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels and a rise to the top of the range at $0.13125258 is probable. This level is likely to attract selling as the 50-week SMA is also located close by.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/uyen-t-nguyen-the-powerful-young-woman-behind-the-alleged-satoshi-affair/,"Uyen T Nguyen: The Powerful Young Woman Behind the Alleged 'Satoshi Affair'

The lawsuit against Craig Wright continues this week and on April 5, court dockets indicate that Florida Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart memorialized rulings from the recent Craig Wright deposition. Moreover, the counsel representing the Kleiman estate has submitted 2,136 documents belonging to Dave Kleiman on April 4. Many of the court documents submitted over the last year reference a mysterious woman named Uyen T Nguyen.

Litigators Are Watching the Kleiman v. Wright Lawsuit With Great Interest

The Kleiman v. Wright lawsuit, otherwise known as the Southern District Court of Florida case 9:18-cv-80176, is one of the 10 most watched legal cases in the state of Florida. This is because the story possibly contains information on one of the most intriguing mysteries in the cryptosphere. The lawsuit started on Feb. 14, 2018, and revolves around allegations that the 47-year old Craig Wright helped create Bitcoin with the South Florida computer security expert David Kleiman (now deceased). But the plaintiffs (the Kleiman family) accuse Wright of defrauding Kleiman’s inheritance. “[Wright] instituted an elaborate scheme to assert dominion over Dave’s and W&K’s bitcoin and intellectual property,” the plaintiff’s statements from case 9:18-cv-80176 allege.

News.Bitcoin.com reported on the recent discovery transcript which describes how the Kleiman estate and Boies Schiller Flexner attorney Devin Freedman explained that the Satoshi Nakamoto story is “relevant” to the proceedings. The discovery also noted that Wright was to be deposed under oath on April 4 and Ira Kleiman would also be deposed on April 8. The discovery transcript further detailed how the Kleiman estate had thousands of documents belonging to David Kleiman and on April 2 the family produced 2,136 documents.

The Case of the Mysterious Young Lady Uyen T Nguyen

Throughout many of the documents produced in the past, and recently submitted over the last 30 days, shows there was a complicated relationship between Wright and Kleiman during Bitcoin’s earliest years. Moreover, the two were involved in a long string of companies together like W&K Info Defense Research, Co1n Ltd., and a few others. Further, Kleiman and Wright allegedly signed a trust together called the Tulip Trust and supposedly this binding agreement sits in Seychelles holding roughly 1 million BTC. Throughout the mess of documents submitted by Kleiman’s counsel and the swathe of filed evidence, one particular name is mentioned throughout: Uyen T Nguyen. According to queried data, Nguyen is a 26-year old Vietnamese woman who is referred to as “the director” of some of Kleiman and Wright’s firms. In other documents, she’s mentioned as the duo’s secretary and some believe Nguyen may be the third or fourth participant to the Satoshi Nakamoto group theory.

Looking for information about Uyen T Nguyen is extremely difficult, but she allegedly made an appearance just before Wright deleted his old Twitter account during the first week of May 2016 after the Gavin Andresen incident. A few old tweets and Reddit posts mention that the well known cryptocurrency advocate known as ‘Bitcoin Belle’ shared information about the young woman that week. According to the posts, Belle had disliked Nguyen and seemed to know a lot more than most people at the time. Since then, however, all of Belle’s tweets talking about Wright have been scrubbed from the web. Nguyen and her signature can be seen in a ton of the documents recently submitted to the court and one specific document called Exhibit 11 shows that Nguyen supposedly lent Wright 650,000 BTC in exchange for a mortgage. However, security experts Wizsec published research which declares the BTC addresses named in that specific document were really owned by random Mt. Gox users and also the exchange’s cold storage wallet. In fact, Wizsec states that all of the documents submitted to the court with unique addresses most likely did not belong to Wright, Kleiman, or Nguyen.

Both Wright and Nguyen did have trading accounts at Mt. Gox though. Wright’s Mt. Gox account was registered in April 2013 and Nguyen’s account was registered later that year. According to Wizsec, Wright had sent thousands of dollars worth of BTC to Nguyen in 2013 and the security experts state that all the BTC deposits sent to Nguyen stemmed from Wright’s account. Wizsec’s report also details that the addresses submitted in the Kleiman v. Wright lawsuit only have one thing in common: “At some point [they] held significant amounts of bitcoin in them.”

‘Appeal to Authority: a Failure of Trust’

Another so-called sighting of the mysterious woman who allegedly had strong ties to Klieman and Wright is in a video filmed on July 10, 2014 at the first Bitcoin conference held in Melbourne, Australia. The conference took place well before Wright came out claiming he was Satoshi and at the nine-minute mark on the video, Wright is asked about Australia specifically.

After the question, Wright grins and explains that Australia was home to something much bigger in regard to the Bitcoin ecosystem in general. However, Wright is immediately cut off by a female assistant who tells him that it wasn’t the right time to discuss what he was referring to and she forcefully answers the question for Wright in the end. Nguyen is allegedly American born and lived in a quiet suburb of Los Angeles for quite some time. During her known online appearances in the Bitcoin Belle tweets during the first week of May, Nguyen also allegedly deleted her Facebook profile and other online accounts that week. However, according to armchair sleuths, before deleting the profile Nguyen posted this document to her Facebook account on March 31.

It’s currently unclear what role Uyen T Nguyen will play going forward in the high profile Florida court case involving a million bitcoin. But Nguyen may be subpoenaed just like the early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik in the next few weeks and she may have to answer questions concerning her name in countless documents featuring both Kleiman and Wright.

Her role was obviously important as Nguyen is listed as W&K Info’s formal agent and she also had the power to disband the firm 18 months later. The three individuals (Wright, Kleiman, and Nguyen) are named in many corporate histories online tied to firms called “Design By Human Ltd” and “Moving Forward in Business Limited.” The estate of Dave Kleiman and his documents may dig deeper into the relationship between the 26-year old woman and Wright. Kleiman’s legal counsel believes the Satoshi information, the so-called reveal and alleged partnerships are pertinent in regard to this legal matter. Last year, the publication Arstechnica sent a letter to Nguyen’s known address in an attempt to reach her but they never received a response.

What do you think about the mysterious woman named in many of the documents belonging to David Kleiman and his businesses? Do you think this court case will reveal anything concerning the Satoshi Nakamoto mystery? Let us know in the comments section below.

Decentralization is one of the buzzwords of blockchain technology: companies and web sites have sprung up that include this word as part of their name.

Decentralization has been touted as a most advanced feature in fintech.

But few realize that decentralization is itself the problem. This concept has kept blockchain technology stalled for many years.

Let me explain:

In the 1960s, computer systems were centralized, or configured as a star network. Only in the early 1970s did the need to connect computers from multiple manufacturers become urgent.

At the time, the nodes of the few existing communication networks were typically organized hierarchically, but from the very beginning the protocols implemented in the nodes of the ARPA, RPCNET, PISA and other groundbreaker networks preceding the internet were designed with the general idea that no central node or authority should control, lead, be the center of, or own the network.

In other words, we knew that a centralized, star, multi-tier network, with its innate bottlenecks, was not going to satisfy even the 1970’s requirements of thousands of users. We also guessed that by reducing the number of bottlenecks through decentralization the problem would be reduced, but not solved. We knew that a solution would have to use a distributed peer-to-peer model.

Since many organizations would be involved in the provision of nodes, links, possibly unreliable hardware and software, we had to assume that the network was unreliable. We did not know how a consistent set of data, or even a single transaction, could be maintained in multiple databases through an unreliable network when any node could generate a message or, in fintech terminology, a financial transaction. The problem was further compounded by the presence of deliberately malicious players.

Why blockchain technology has been hindered by decentralization

In general terms, we recognize that a network is decentralized when the control of the network is shared among a subset of the network’s nodes.

A network is distributed when all nodes equally share responsibilities and run the same node software.

Decentralized (permissioned and leader-based) networks were often extensions of centralized networks deriving from application requirements, for example by the fintech industry.

The blockchain network software (basic system software) should not be designed according application requirements, as these will change. We did not design the network precursors of the Internet and the Internet itself based only on the requirements of 1970’s applications. We could not have predicted what industries would develop based on the ability to share information globally.

In the same way, the underlying blockchain network should be as general, flexible and scalable as possible. The permissioned, client-server, and private network requirements can then be considered as special cases of a distributed network, for example by using the concept of Virtual Private (blockchain) Networks.

Distributed networks are more likely to be independent of any specific physical structure. Nodes can dynamically connect to each other and random connection procedures could possibly be used. Consensus solutions implemented on distributed networks can also be unpermissioned, majority- driven and recursive.

Distribution, not decentralization, should have been the main objective of crypto-network design.

Why we failed

The failure to investigate distributed consensus agreements partly derives from the 1982 formulation of the Byzantine Generals’ problem which models how information integrity can be maintained in an unreliable environment. The Byzantine Generals problem has been studied by researchers for over thirty years.

The analogy of several allied army divisions holding a city under siege correctly assumed that no-one in the field could be trusted to deliver a message and that some of the generals themselves could not be trusted when issuing a command.

However, the formulation of the army analogy suggested at least two classes of troops: generals and soldiers.

Some people then restricted their thinking to a more specific case in which the generals issued commands that needed to be both carried to other generals and protected from tampering by attackers or traitors.

Eventually, this approach led to a limited definition of the consensus problem. Leader-based consensus models such as Paxos and Raft were and taught in universities and adopted as models by designers of implementations of blockchain networks.

As a result, practical solutions of the Byzantine Generals problem focused on various methods for selecting a leader node, which would send a block of verified information to all other nodes, instead of seeking to achieve a consensus on the content of the block.

Missing the target

A consensus on which node should be the current leader does not solve the problem of trust. The current leader must be trusted. It must do the job of verifying and assembling blocks in a fair manner. Thus, the leader in current leader-based consensus protocols is required to provide some credentials: proof of work, proof of stake, proof of capacity or proof of anything else.

These “proofs” do not guarantee much more than a vested interest that leader nodes (or nodes aspiring to be leader nodes) may have in the network: the more interest they acquire, the less they will be willing to destroy their form of income.

These “proofs” guarantee that potential leaders have credentials, but do not guarantee that the information assembled in the block is correct, or at least that it has been verified by a majority of the nodes.

We have seen more than 60 proposed solutions based on leader-based models for various blockchain implementations. They suffer from a common fault: one node decides what every other node will store on the blockchain. The result is almost the opposite of what is required.

Summary of the disadvantages of leader-based protocols

Leader-based protocols have the following disadvantages:

They do not solve the problem of trust. The leader node may introduce faulty data, intentionally or not, in the block of information.

Rewards, associated with the work of verifying and assembling blocks, create an incentive for nodes to compete for the rewards and to be promoted to leadership positions. This incentive tends to create a special class of nodes. The network then morphs into a decentralized network. For example, Bitcoin started as a network of peers where every node could verify transactions and compete for a reward. Today it is a two-class network (miners and users) and is controlled by large pools of owners.

When the assembly of a block is left to one node, one of the major requirements of consensus theory is invalidated: the agreement is not based on a majority consensus about what information will be stored on the blockchain. The only agreement reached is the method for choosing a leader node.

A bottleneck, or single point of failure, is introduced: One node has to broadcast a block to every other node.

Efficiency is not the best: large blocks of data are more subject to transmission errors and re- transmissions of maximum size packets.

Redundancy is almost 100%: Each transaction included in a block has already been received by every node separately, when the transaction was initially issued.

A better analogy

When thinking about an analogy for the problem of reaching a common decision in an unorganized and unreliable environment, we could have used an analogy of an army without ranks, but it would not have been very intuitive.

A better analogy could have been the challenge of deciding the daily closing price on a stock exchange. In this analogy, a multitude of buyers and sellers determines the daily closing price of stocks using a stochastic process, without any particular person taking a decision for anyone else.

In the stock market there is no “right” answer for a stock price, but just an agreed daily closing price.

Similarly, in the composition of a block several variables, such as the order of the transactions, can determine the final block composition. There is no “right” block composition, but just one that nodes agree on.

Consensus protocols based on a more distributed analogy could have avoided the tendency towards centralization and the requirement of intermediate nodes, typical of leader-based protocols.

Examples of intermediaries in a network are:

Miners, producers or verifiers, volunteering or engaged to provide a service to the network,

Special nodes of federated systems that have a stake in the success of the network,

Nodes elected with some criteria to perform network governance,

Nodes owned by trusted companies or institutions,

Special players, such as centralized Currency Exchanges holding user wallets.

What’s wrong with Intermediaries?

First of all, it is a question of cost: If the intermediaries are doing useful work, for example verifying transactions, then they need to be rewarded.

It is also a question of trust: customers using a network with intermediaries need to trust:

that the intermediary is not giving preference to certain users or transactions,

that the intermediary has not been, or will not be, taken over by a malicious attacker,

that the intermediary’s system is not experiencing a blackout, or targeted by a DoS attack, or experiencing a system failure, or any other cause that will affect or delay customer transactions,

that intermediarys’ system software and data are reliable, so that data integrity and security are guaranteed.

that they are really connected to a trusted system and not to an impersonator (e.g., some other system pretending to be a trusted intermediary), and

that no other unpredictable event will happen. Recently, for example, the owner of the Canadian currency exchange Quadriga died or disappeared. As a result millions of dollars of customers’ funds are missing.

Finally, it is a question of data availability. If a network has a privileged or restricted class of nodes managing the blockchain, then the majority of nodes do not have immediate access to the current replica of the blockchain. This may preclude the development of real-time applications, such as automated trading applications.

Is it too late to change the model for blockchain consensus?

Most experts will tell you that a major function of consensus protocols is to maintain the security of the network. This view confuses two issues. Security is certainly needed, but it is a completely different requirement that can be solved by other means (and this will be the subject of a separate article).

Still, many developers are stuck with the ideas that consensus means choosing a leader and that consensus is needed to maintain security.

With hind-sight, if we had thought of a better distributed analogy, the research could have turned towards a different direction, suggesting stochastic approaches and possibly could have led us to the earlier development of better distributed solutions without intermediaries.

This is now an education issue, more than a technical issue. Most researchers, consultants and experts on crypto-networks are proficient in all the details of PoW, PoS, DPoS and several dozen alternatives, all based on the same leader-based model. The few solutions that are not leader-based, are not blockchain solutions: They are solutions in which each transaction is handled separately.

On the positive side, most people and 95% of companies, according to a recent poll, understand the potential of blockchain technology.

A transition, from a de-centralized to a distributed model, is urgently required to unlock the blockchain’s true potential, to solve the problems of scalability and to run the blockchain on any user device without intermediaries.

He also quit Twitter, where he would often publish his opinions on anonymity (bad), Bitcoin SV (the real Bitcoin) and other cryptocurrencies (also bad).

He is also known for arguing that he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin. Here’s the complete list of things you should know about Wright.

Wright’s bio is really rich, but hardly verifiable

He was born in October 1970 in Australia, according to registration papers of one of his many companies. As per a Business Insider article citing his now-edited LinkedIn profile, Wright graduated from Brisbane's Padua Catholic College in 1987. In the early 1990s, he worked as a sauce cook, “having trained in French cuisine,” and spent three years working with a catering company.

Wright was reportedly studying at the University of Queensland while working as a chef. He initially attended engineering classes, but switched to computer science in his fourth year.

In 1996, as per his earlier LinkedIn bio, he began working at Ozemail, where he was ""managing a bunch of engineers,"" thus starting his eventful career in tech. However, according to a 2007 Computerworld article, he began working in IT when he joined K-Mart in 1985 — which would have been even before he finished high school.

In April 1997, Wright says he joined the Australian Stock Exchange, maintaining security and firewalls. In November the same year, he launched a company called DeMorgan, described as ""a pre-IPO Australian listed company focused on alternative currency, next generation banking and reputational and educational products with a focus on security and creating a simple user experience.""

In fact, up until July 2015, Morgan was the CEO of about 15 companies. As the Guardian points out, in the space of a week, he resigned as director from Cloudcroft Pty Ltd, Coin-Exch Pty Ltd, Daso Pty Ltd, Demorgan Holdings Pty Ltd, Demorgan Ltd, Denariuz, Ezas Pty Ltd, Integyrz Pty Ltd, Misfit Games Pty Ltd, Interconnected Research Pty Ltd, Zuhl Pty Ltd and Pholus Pty Ltd, and remained the director of just three companies: Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty Ltd, Panopticrypt Pty Ltd and Hotwire PE Employee Share Plan Pty Ltd. Currently, his LinkedIn only features a startup called nChain, where he has allegedly been working as a “chief scientist” since June 2015.

Wright seems to be a man of libertarian views. According to the Cypherpunk mailing list archive, in September 1996, Wright wrote that he had developed cancer during his years at university and took a loan to pay for medical treatment because the health insurance didn’t cover it. He then mentioned that he served in the military and worked at a gas station “even though I am an engineer,” adding:

“So why and for what reason should I have to pay several 10's of thousands each year to support others. I have never taken help from the government, I do not feel I should have to pay as well. And what am I paying for...to protect the status quo. I believe that there is more than enough help for ppl available. They just need to get off their butts and work.”

In sum, Wright’s biography seems to be considerably replete and busy — or, at least, he portrays it that way. On top of having two PhDs, Wright wields numerous certifications in computer forensics and information technology (IT). In February, he published two Medium articles in which he claimed to have worked as an “agent of influence” in Venezuela and Colombia. Picturing himself as a James Bond-esque character fighting terrorism and evil, Wright says he was “shot twice” during the operation. Also, at some point, he claims that he “was a pastor once.”

According to his story, the Australian entrepreneur came back from South America to witness Bitcoin — which he created (more about that below) — being used on the darknet.

“I discovered the creation I had given birth to, something I designed to bring light was being used for all the worst reasons. Not only drugs, but people. Anonymity is a curse. Nothing good comes of it.”

Wright has several times claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and refused to provide sufficient proof

Wright become a known figure in crypto community after media reports linking his identity to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, surfaced in late 2015. Previously, in 2014, one of his few reported links to cryptocurrencies was that he tried launching the world’s first Bitcoin bank.

Thus, in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported within hours of each other that the Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur might be the creator of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

The Wired story claimed that Wright ""either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did."" It was based on documents and emails that were purportedly leaked by “an anonymous source close to Wright” to an independent security researcher Gwern Branwen, who co-wrote the article with Wired author Andy Greenberg.

Similarly, Gizmodo ran a story that featured documents allegedly obtained by a hacker who accessed Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and his friend, computer forensics analyst and cybersecurity specialist David Kleiman, who died in 2013.

Moreover, on the same day the articles were published, Australian Federal Police (AFP) raided Wright’s house in the Sydney suburb of Gordon. However, the AFP clarified that the operation was not related to the Bitcoin claims.

A substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports — along with Wright’s previous claims — was soon proved false. First, Wright's company Cloudcroft had declared to have two supercomputers, one of which allegedly produced by computer manufacturer SGI. However, SGI soon clarified that ""Cloudcroft has never been an SGI customer and SGI has no relationship with Cloudcroft CEO Craig Steven Wright.""

Further, Wright had listed two PhDs on his LinkedIn page, including one from Charles Sturt University. Eventually, Forbes contacted the university and found out that it hadn’t granted Wright any PhDs, although it gave him three master's degrees in networking and systems administration, management (IT), and information systems security. Wright was, however, awarded with a doctorate degree by Charles Sturt University later in 2017.

Also, a technical analysis of two PGP public keys attributed to Wright, but also linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, showed that they were created more recently than the documents in which they were featured.

Finally, a number of posts in Wright's now-deleted blog that seemed to portray him as a person who was directly involved in Bitcoin’s creation had been backdated or edited; the archived versions of the posts from 2013 show none of those breadcrumbs that Wright could have planted to mislead the media into thinking he is Satoshi.

After the aforementioned stories went live, Wright promptly took down his social media accounts and disappeared for several months. On May 2, 2016, he came back (he now lives in London, United Kingdom, according to his LinkedIn profile) and publicly declared that he is the creator of Bitcoin. Later on in the same month, Wright published a sentimental apology piece where he refused to publish the proof of access to one of the earliest Bitcoin keys, saying he doesn’t have the “courage” do it.

However, Wright still claims to be the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator. Just last month, the entrepreneur filed two near-identical comment letters to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in which he again declared that he is Satoshi. The documents were submitted in response to the agency’s request for industry input and feedback on Ethereum’s (ETH) mechanics and market.

Specifically, Wright wrote that he worked “under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto,” and ""completed a project [...] started in 1997 that was filed with the Australian government in part under an AusIndustry project registered with the Dept. of Innovation as BlackNet.”

BlackNet — an alleged precursor to Bitcoin — was submitted to the Australian government in 2001, according to one of Wright’s tweets (he deleted his Twitter profile earlier this month).

On Reddit, user Skoopitup argued that the BlackNet paper that Wright supposedly submitted in 2001 largely copied the official Bitcoin white paper (published October 2008), which notably contained significant corrections to an earlier draft that had been shared by Satoshi earlier in August 2008.

In his remaining comments to the CFTC, Wright wrote:

“The amount of misunderstanding and fallacious information that has been propagated concerning bitcoin [...] has resulted in my choice to start to become more public. The system I created was designed in part to end fraud as best as that can be done with any technology. The lack of understanding [...] has resulted in [...] a dissemination of old scams.”

The Australian entrepreneur still hasn’t signed a message with the key associated with Bitcoin's genesis block, which could be seen as strong evidence of him actually being Satoshi Nakamoto.

Wright played a key role in the BCH hash wars — and now claims that Bitcoin SV is the original Bitcoin

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that emerged on Aug. 1, 2017 after departing from Bitcoin’s original blockchain via a hard fork in an attempt to manage its scalability issue.

The BCH network performs hard forks as part of scheduled protocol upgrades. The fork scheduled for Nov. 15, 2018, however, was disrupted by a competing proposal that was not compatible with the original roadmap. As a result, the BCH community was split into three fractions: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin SV.

Craig Wright lead the Bitcoin SV team, whose goal was to restore “the original Satoshi protocol” by changing the current BCH structure. Specifically, that involved entirely overwriting the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increasing the block size of BCH from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB in order to increase network capacity and scale. Bitcoin SV’s cryptocurrency design was made by Wright’s nChain company.

At some point, after Jihan Wu, co-founder of major crypto miner and manufacturer Bitmain, who supported the Bitcoin ABC team, accused Wright of being a Blockstream spy and a “fake Satoshi.” In response, the computer scientist entered a verbal fight. Specifically, Wright tagged Roger Ver — another ABC proponent — and Bitmain with bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silk Road machinations and child pornography.

Even though Bitcoin ABC essentially won the so-called “hash wars” and secured the original BCH ticker, Bitcoin SV lives on. In late February, Bitcoin SV’s value rose 20 percent, driving it into the top-10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As of press time, Bitcoin SV is the 12th-largest token, with a market cap of $1.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

Craigh Wright has a lot of blockchain patents

According to the publication Hard Fork, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has published 155 patents applications filed by Wright — all of which were submitted through his company nChain. Thirty-five of those were published this year. The earliest document date relates to Aug. 31, 2017.

The majority of those applications mention blockchain. Specifically, Hard Fork writes, the term “blockchain” was used 114 times in patent titles. “Cryptocurrency,” in turn, is only featured six times, while “Bitcoin” is not mentioned at all.

Wright has written about his patents quest via Twitter (which has been deleted). According to the screenshots cited by Hard Fork, Wright decided to file his patents in Europe because it was “harder”:

“Once we have the EU, we have the PCT [Patent Cooperation Treaty] in the USA. The US is simpler.”

The Patent Cooperation Treaty has been signed by 152 countries. After filing one international patent application under the PCT, applicants can get simultaneously protection for their inventions in many countries.

As per Bloomberg, business-wise blockchain patents “are an essential ingredient for companies looking to reshape the financial services industry or spawn profitable cryptocurrency-related businesses.” Basically, such patents help companies attract investment, protect property rights and collect monopoly profits from other companies using their inventions.

It’s been argued that Wright is filing patents without the intent of actually using them, but instead to demand large payouts from companies which happen to use similar technologies in their line of work. As Marc Kaufman, an attorney who co-chairs the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council at the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce, told Fortune:

“His tactics and activities have all the marks of being a patent assertion entity or what’s pejoratively known as a troll. I’m not aware of his companies having any products.”

Craig Wright is being sued for at least $1 billion

In February 2018, the estate of David Kleiman — Wright’s associate and computer forensics expert who died in April 2013 seemingly of natural causes related to complications from a MRSA infection — brought the suit against Wright to the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida. The estate is represented by Ira Kleiman, David’s brother.

According to court documents that surfaced on Reddit, the plaintiff claims that Wright stole hundreds of thousands of BTC, worth over $5 billion dollars at the time, from David Kleiman’s estate. The statement by the plaintiff alleges that Wright recognized that Kleiman’s friends and family were initially unaware of the wealth he accumulated.

Specifically, the statement reads, Wright “forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave’s signature on them.”

Wright contacted Kleiman’s estate after his associate’s death and disclosed that he and David had worked together to develop blockchain and Bitcoin, according to the plaintiff.

In December 2018, new documents were published online, indicating that the court had rejected repeated requests from the nChain chief scientist to dismiss the lawsuit.

In an amended lawsuit supported by Judge Beth Bloom, a figure of 300,000 BTC ($1.5 billion as of press time) was now circulating.

“The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion,” the court document confirms, continuing:

“The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts, which was an unauthorized act that deprived the Plaintiffs of the bitcoins therein. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim for conversion [...] survives Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.”

In March 2019, Jeff Garzik, one of the earliest contributors to the Bitcoin codebase, was reportedly subpoenaed by the court for documents relating to the Kleiman vs. Wright complaint.

Specifically, the court demanded “all documents, communications, and agreements that support his [Jeff’s] personal theory that Dave Kleiman is Satoshi Nakamoto.” In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Garzik suggested that Dave Kleiman was the original creator of Bitcoin.

Wright doesn’t have a particularly good relationship with crypto community

After some of the aforementioned inconsistencies related to Wright’s claim that he is Satoshi surfaced, the crypto community became increasingly skeptical about the Australian computer scientist. However, some of his claims in regard to other cryptocurrencies certainly didn’t help.

In January 2019, for instance, he called Andreas Antonopoulos, author of the book “Mastering Bitcoin,” a “shitcoin expert.” In February this year, Wright told CNBC Africa’s Ran Neuner in a rather rude form that he knows how to deanonymize and destroy privacy coins Zcash and Monero, which he apparently is going to do “sometime this year”:

“If you have a privacy coin, I will show you that it is basically as private as running through Times Square with your pants around your ankles.”

In October 2017, in a now-deleted tweet, Wright argued that the Lightning Network was “oversold.”

At the 2018 Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly questioned Wright’s competence, calling him a fraud.

“Given he makes so many non-sequiturs and mistakes, why is this fraud allowed to speak at this conference?”

In response, Wright tweeted: “Oh well.... looks like I broke Vitalek… :) He is a twig.. must remember to be gentle next time ....”

Last week, the Australian entrepreneur deleted his Twitter page after removing over 10,000 tweets.

On March 17, not long before erasing his presence on the social media outlet, Wright tweeted that he will be “taking action aggressively to remove any site that is in error or makes false claims,” referring to people calling him a fraud, among other things.

“You do not have a right to lies under ‘free speech’ nor harassment, nor libel and slander,” he wrote. “If an error is reported in a malicious context concerning me, expect to be living in a barrel when we finish with you.”",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-07/crypto-exchange-kraken-sued-by-former-trading-desk-manager,"Why did this happen?

Monarch Wallet Supports Bitcoin Cash (BCH) & Roger Ver Joins as Investor/Advisor

Summary:

Monarch Blockchain Corporation is excited to announce that Roger Ver is joining as an investor and advisor. Monarch Wallet now supports Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Roger Ver decided to invest in Monarch Blockchain Corporation as well as become an advisor. Monarch Wallet has added Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its list of over 1900 supported cryptocurrencies.

Content:

Monarch Blockchain Corporation is very excited to announce that Roger Ver has joined Monarch as an investor as well as an advisor. This is truly exciting because Roger Ver has been a proponent of Bitcoin and blockchain technology since 2011. As Monarch continues to build products and increase it’s footprint in the cryptocurrency marketplace, it is a very big deal for someone like Roger to see Monarch and decide to not only become an investor but become a trusted advisor as well.

Roger Ver started his career founding MemoryDealers.com in 1999 while still attending college. This company became a market leader and is still in business today. In 2005 he saw a market opportunity for fiber optic transceivers that are used in networking subsystems and he founded Agilestar.com. The company continues to sell thousands of Agilestar transceivers around the world annually. In 2011, Roger heard about Bitcoin for the first time when the price was still under $1. He saw the importance of this invention and his company MemoryDealers.com became the first in the world to start accepting Bitcoin as a payment option.

Roger Ver has been quoted as saying, “Bitcoin is one of the most important inventions in all of human history. For the first time ever, anyone can send or receive any amount of money with anyone else, anywhere on the planet, conveniently and without restriction. It’s the dawn of a better, more free world.”

As seen in the quote above, Roger is a huge proponent of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Roger is one of the first people to start investing in Bitcoin startups. His website reports, “He nearly single handedly funded the entire first generation of Bitcoin and Blockchain businesses including Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, Bitpay.com, Kraken.com, purse.io, and many more. ” Roger Ver is the co-founder and an investor in Blockchain.com. He invested in Blockchain.com when it was still being run from a Mac Mini from the bedroom of the founder in his parents’ home.

Roger started with Bitcoin.com in 2014 and continues as the CEO now. His team consists of around 90 full time people and he plans to grow it within the next year. Bitcoin.com is a source for everything Bitcoin related.

Roger is also a big supporter of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin that happened on August 1, 2017. It increased the block size to 8mb to help scale the underlying technology of Bitcoin. He feels Bitcoin Cash follows the original whitepaper for Bitcoin. This means it’s a peer to peer electronic currency, not just for speculation.

The Monarch Wallet Update now brings support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Users can now store, send and receive BCH from the Monarch Wallet on Android and iOS. You can Download the Monarch Wallet Here. The wallet also supports over 1900 cryptocurrencies and has other features like a fiat gateway that lets customers buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with their credit card or bank account at some of the most competitive rates available. Users can also make most any Erc-20 to Erc-20 token exchange using the decentralized exchange in-app, switch between a hot and cold wallet by simply removing internet access to the device their app is located on, and even earn up to 7.1% APR interest with their crypto. All of this while maintaining control of their own keys and seed.

Keeping cryptocurrencies safe is hard work. So hard that according to studies conducted by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, 4 million bitcoins are believed to be lost forever. These are worth a whopping $19.9 billion at today’s prices.

In the industry, cold storage solutions are seen as the best answer, as they allow users to keep their funds offline and away from hackers who may be trying to compromise them. There are two main ways to store private keys offline: through hardware wallets and through paper wallets.

Addressing the paper wallets first, we know there are plenty of problems with them because they’re made out of paper! This means they can accidentally be thrown away, damaged, or even lost. Keeping thousands of dollars worth of crypto this way should, at the very least, make users feel uneasy.

Hardware wallets, on the other hand, are safer, but at the end of the day are glorified USB memory sticks with several security add-ons stopping hackers from getting to them. Electronics, however, don’t last forever and in the long run they’re susceptible to malfunctioning, software failures, and exposure.

How Hardware Wallets Can Fail Us

While hardware wallets are the go-to solutions in the crypto space, they’re a temporary one. Keeping funds offline through them works against hackers and or own mistakes,as they stop us from accidentally clicking the wrong link, entering the website, or revealing information to the wrong person.

Yet let’s say we want these funds to be secure throughout our lives, and passed on to those we love when we’re no longer here. Several flaws come to mind: the software may no longer be usable, the pin codes needed to access the coins may have been forgotten, and natural disasters may completely destroyed the hardware.

Fires, floods, and earthquakes, for example, can completely destroy a hardware cryptocurrency wallet, potentially leading to a loss of funds. While paper copies of the seed and pin codes can be kept safe in various locations, paper deteriorates over time, even by simply being exposed to the environment.

Maintaining various pieces of paper in safe places throughout a lifetime sounds like a faulty plan, and extreme measures like these are reserved to potential bitcoin billionaires like the owners of the Gemini exchange, the Winklevoss twins.

In an interesting article, Wired editor Mark Frauenfelder detailed that he lost $30,000 worth of BTC over flaws in these two systems: his paper copy of the seed phrase was thrown out, and he forgot his pin code. Lucky for him, a months-long crusade to recover the funds saw him pay a security expert nearly $4,000 to help him crack his hardware wallet – through a now-fixed vulnerability.

Metal Seed Storage Devices Are The Solution

For the average HODLer to keep his or her funds safe there’s an easy-to-use solution: metal seed storage devices. These are essentially an upgraded version of paper wallets, made out of material that doesn’t deteriorate easily, and can survive natural disasters like fires or floods.

Since these don’t deteriorate easily, they allow users to keep HODLing for decades without worrying about the state of their cold storage wallets. Over the years, several materials have been tested, in order to find something that would be affordable, and yet able to withstand corrosion, high temperatures, and more.

In a Medium post published by bitcoin engineer Jameson Lopp, it’s clear the search wasn’t easy. CRYPTOTAG, a cryptocurrency security firm, has however been able to find the answer, and is currently creating space graded titanium wallets for cryptocurrency users.

These can withstand temperatures up to 1,665°C (3,029°F), are corrosion and erosion resistant, and have “bullet stopping power.” Adding to that, they’re compatible with Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey hardware wallets.

To help crypto users maintain their financial legacy without worrying about complex storage solutions, CryptoGlobe has partnered with CRYPTOTAG to elevate the security standard of the crypto space.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/online-bank-mistertango-offers-crypto-companies-multiple-accounts-and-ibans/,"Online Bank Mistertango Offers Crypto Companies Multiple Accounts and Ibans

While it’s tempting to view cryptocurrency as cutting edge and the harbinger of dozens of fascinating use cases, the reality is that in terms of absolute development, crypto has not even taken off yet. Let’s have a look at how that can be, and what we can learn from the development of the internet to better understand where crypto is headed.

The Perez Surge Cycle

There is some debate about where cryptocurrency falls on the Perez Surge Cycle, a useful approximation for determining into what stage a technology exists. Some people claim that 2017 and early 2018 marked the frenzy period, with a parabolic bubble and media attention like never before.

However, a more conservative estimate is that crypto is in fact still in the gestation phase. Daniel Heyman, author of this post detailing why we haven’t yet seen the frenzy stage, makes the following claim, “2018 was not a Perez-style frenzy and bubble because it did not include key outcomes that are necessary to reach a turning point: significant infrastructure improvements and replicable business models.”

If Daniel is correct and we’re still in the gestation phase, it means the real frenzy and bubble will be larger than anything we’ve seen so far.

The Timeline to Mass Adoption

In about twenty-five years we went from nothing to more than half of the world’s population using the internet. It appears likely that crypto will at a minimum follow this growth pattern. However, what’s more likely is that crypto adoption will happen ever faster. Thanks to the internet development can take place at an accelerated rate and ideas can spread as fast as it takes to send an email.

If we consider crypto to be roughly at 1994 or 1995 levels of adoption, as compared to the internet, we can see that the number of users today is only a shadow of what it will be in just a few years. Adoption is not linear either, each year more people will get involved. It will take twice as long to go from zero to one billion users, as it will to go from one billion to two billion users.



The Innovators

The customer adoption phase graph shows how new products and services are adopted. When we use this graph to track crypto adoption it’s quite apparent that people using cryptocurrency today are among the first of the innovators.

Statista claims that at the end of 2018 there were 31 million crypto wallet users in the world. When compared to the world population of about 7.6 billion people, we can see that just .42% of people on this planet are involved with cryptocurrency.

What it All Means

Having determined that by almost any metric crypto is still in a very early stage of development, it’s easy to see that the growth that’s going to happen in the coming years and decades is going to take place on an unprecedented scale.

Each year more people are going to use crypto than the year before. As that happens there will be more developers improving the technology and those advances are going to lead to price rises that may be hard to even conceive of now.

News.Bitcoin.com reached out to several Localbitcoins traders to find out about the challenges facing peer-to-peer crypto brokers.

“It’s A Lion’s Den”

News.Bitcoin.com spoke to an Australian Localbitcoins trader who has been operating on the platform for just “a few months.”

The trader, who wishes to remain anonymous, works alongside roughly 2 other individuals, with the company’s operations demanding approximately 40 hours of work. The company was started using pooled savings, with all of the individuals continuing to work outside of trading.

The company conducts trades both online and face-to-face, with in-person trades occurring in public places where security cameras are present. The trader also requests know-your-customer information prior to meeting customers. The traders recently started offering trades via their own website, however, most of their trades are still executed using Localbitcoins.

When first operating on the platform, the trader lost “a lot of money to scammers,” attributing such to having been too trusting toward prospective customers. The trader also recounted having their bank accounts frozen as a consequence of malicious actors hacking the account and using it to carry out scams.

The trader described Localbitcoins as comprising “a lion’s den,” adding “I advise anyone to get good training before going on the platform.” The trader also hopes that the criminal presence on Localbitcoins will be “controlled” following the rolling out of the platform’s new anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing policies.

The trader also described “bank hostility” as the largest challenge currently faced by Localbitcoins traders.

Australian Cryptocurrency Regulations Alienates Small Localbitcoins Traders

MJ from Bitcoin Babe has been operating on Localbitcoins for nearly five years. Her company comprises a one-woman operation, demanding approximately 105 hours of MJ’s time each week.

MJ offers both online and face-to-face trades and takes a number of security precautions when trading in person – conducting such in public places where there is sufficient security, such as banks, and informing friends and family as to where she is going and how long the trade should take to complete.

While MJ offers trades through a private website and other P2P websites, the vast majority of her transactions occur on Localbitcoins, with MJ estimating that 95% of her trade takes place on the platform.

Despite Localbitcoins comprising such a large percentage of her operations, MJ states that the benefits of the platform “have been drying up lately,” adding that she has been trying to move away from P2P platforms “for quite some time now.”

MJ describes Australia’s regulatory climate pertaining to cryptocurrencies as an “absolute shit show,” adding that the country’s regulatory body, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), “really rushed into things without a proper assessment of the market and community.”

By her assessment, the current legislative framework comprises “an attempt to try and blanket everyone in a one size fits all approach,” resulting in many “small traders/businesses exit[ing] the scene because the cost of regulation killed it for them.” MJ adds that “people continue to trade unregistered with no inkling of punishment or repercussion” despite AUSTRAC having issued “threats of jail time during pre-registration conferences.”

The new Samsung Galaxy S10 has reportedly been hacked.

Widely touted as a game-changer for the crypto community because of its groundbreaking integration of a cryptocurrency wallet, the Samsung Galaxy S10 is apparently a lot less secure than intended.

In February, Samsung announced that its latest S10 model would integrate a secure blockchain wallet to store private keys for crypto assets. But a new video posted on Imgur shows how a hacker named darkshark, a security researcher, appears to bypass the mobile device’s biometric security system to unlock the phone.

Using an elaborate scheme, darkshark shows how the phone’s built-in ultrasonic fingerprint sensor can be fooled – by using a 3D model of a fingerprint that takes approximately 13 minutes to print after a longer process that involves photographing an original fingerprint, doctoring the image in Photoshop, creating a 3D model and, finally, printing it.

According to darkshark, he used his smartphone to photograph his own fingerprint that was left on a wine glass.

“It took me 3 reprints trying to get the right ridge height (and I forgot to mirror the fingerprint on the first one) but yeah, 3rd time was the charm. The 3D print will unlock my phone… in some cases just as well as my actual finger does.

This brings up a lot of ethics questions and concerns. There’s nothing stopping me from stealing your fingerprints without you ever knowing, then printing gloves with your fingerprints built into them and going and committing a crime. If I steal someone’s phone, their fingerprints are already on it. I can do this entire process in less than 3 minutes and remotely start the 3d print so that it’s done by the time I get to it. Most banking apps only require fingerprint authentication so I could have all of your info and spend your money in less than 15 minutes if your phone is secured by fingerprint alone.”

Last month, the Samsung Galaxy S10 debuted with a slew of rich features, but the tech giant only rolled out the crypto wallet in the US, Canada and Korea out of the 70 countries where it is currently available for purchase. The geo-restrictions left buyers around the world wondering why they weren’t able to activate the crypto wallet feature, even though they were able to download the appropriate Android application package to implement the wallet.

This stage it is only available to the US, Canada and Korea. If any updates are available you will be notified. — Samsung Australia (@SamsungAU) February 28, 2019

CoinDesk Korea reports that the Samsung Blockchain Wallet is currently compatible only with Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, with full support for other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, slated for a future date.

Regarding the cloned fingerprint, darkshark cautions,

“If I stole your phone…your fingerprints are currently on it.”

“I actually distorted my fingerprints before posting this, so no, you can’t use this same technique against me lol.

This was just an experiment and I’m not going to dive much further into biometric physical hacking or anything. Just thought it was an interesting idea and it happened to work very well.”",2019-04-07,,,

China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory grey area.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.

The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to more than 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.

It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.

State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday the draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry.

“The NDRC’s move is in line overall with China’s desire to control different layers of the rapidly growing crypto industry, and does not yet signal a major shift in policy,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment firm Kenetic.

“I believe China simply wants to ‘reboot’ the crypto industry into one that they have oversight on, the same approach they took with the Internet.”

Other bitcoin traders said they were not surprised by the government’s move.

“Bitcoin mining wastes a lot of electricity,” said one Chinese bitcoin trader who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.

CRACKDOWN CONTINUES

Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted they were puzzled by the surge.

Bitcoin, which accounts for around half of the cryptocurrency market, was down by around 1.4 percent on Tuesday, while other major coins such as Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP also fell by similar amounts. Traders in London said it was unclear how much the Chinese move was weighing on the market.

The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.

China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.

Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners that team up for economies of scale - are located in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said in December.

“Half of the network is probably located in China,” said Alex de Vries, a consultant with PwC in Amsterdam who specializes on blockchain and researches cryptocurrency mining. He added that the number of mining facilities in the world is still limited to several hundred.

Countries with relatively cheap electricity have emerged as major hosts of cryptocurrency mining. Mati Greenspan, an analyst with eToro in Israel, said any ban by China would cut a key supply of cheap electricity for the industry and raise the average cost to mine bitcoin.

Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.

However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc, have since let their applications lapse.

People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies’ business models and prospects.

Bitmain declined to comment on the NDRC’s proposal to ban bitcoin mining. Canaan did not respond to requests for comment.

According to Canaan’s IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for cryptocurrency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.

The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020.",2019-04-09 04:21:34+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-traders-pay-extra-for-bitcoin-through-otc-desks-amid-crypto-market-surge,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surge last week has led Chinese traders not only return to trading but pay a premium for doing so, social media-based news account cnLedger reported on April 7.

Reproducing price spreads from cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi and OKEx, cnLedger revealed an increasingly common practice among Chinese traders who wish to acquire Bitcoin.

Since China formally banned cryptocurrency trading in 2017, investors have had few options. Purchasing stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) via over-the-counter (OTC) services and converting them to other cryptocurrencies has become the principal method, cnLedger noted.

Now, in the wake of a bullish week for Bitcoin which saw BTC/USD advance by over $1,000, prices for those OTC services have steadily risen in CNY terms, marking an increase in demand.

“Chinese markets reveal strong buys,” the resource summarized. The tweet stated:

“OTC (Over-The-Counter) trades, the almost only way to buy bitcoin with fiat in China, showing considerable $ premium (1 USDT = 7 CNY) over the official rate of 1 USD = 6.7 CNY.”

The buoyant mood among Chinese investors contrasts with the ongoing clampdown on cryptocurrency-related activities in the country. As Cointelegraph reported, this has extended to anything construed as propaganda, while associated instruments such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) are also outlawed.

By contrast, authorities continue to advocate the development of blockchain technology, both within the state and private sector. Last week, Beijing approved almost 200 firms as part of new plans to register blockchain service providers.

Previously, it was reported that China in fact has more blockchain-related projects underway than any other country worldwide, alongside the largest number of blockchain patents.",,https://www.coindesk.com/korean-crypto-scam-fleeced-investors-for-over-18-5-million,"Individuals behind a cryptocurrency scam in South Korea have cheated around 56,000 investors out of $18.5 million, police say.

According to a report from Korea JoongAng Daily on Monday, the Seoul Special Judicial Police Bureau for Public Safety has arrested the CEOs of an online shopping website and a bitcoin firm, identified by their surnames Lee and Bae, as well 10 other people said to be involved with the Ponzi scheme.

The police bureau said that the CEOs formed a “members-only” shopping website and a cryptocurrency exchange in the Gangnam district of South Korean capital Seoul last year. From May to October 2018, the accused reportedly recruited members for an annual membership fee of 330,000 won ($288) or a “premium” membership fee of 990,000 won ($864), also offering 10-year membership that included discounts on items.

Notably, the police bureau used artificial intelligence (AI) “investigator” to track down the Ponzi scheme.

“Through keywords such as Ponzi, loan and recruiting members, we were able to teach the AI patterns of Ponzi schemes,” a member of the bureau’s investigation team told the news source.

As is typical of Ponzis, the shopping website provided rewards to members for recruitment of new victims: 60,000 won ($52) in cash for each new member and 120,000 won ($104) to the initial recruiter if a new member persuaded another person to join.

Members were also rewarded in a cryptocurrency called M-coin issued by the associated cryptocurrency exchange. Lee and Bae allegedly targeted investors with the token too, telling them that its price would rise from 200 won ($0.17) to 600 won ($0.52) and that they would profit “immediately” if they invested.

The exchange reportedly had about 200 offices, with the managers of each being given cash rewards for each additional member recruited above 20 members, according to the report. The scam allegedly targeted investors with little knowledge of cryptocurrencies, especially older people, to invest in the illegal scheme.

The CEOs – who made about 21.2 billion ($18.5 million) won from membership fees and token sales – further hid their firm’s accounting information on a corporate server in Japan. When the investigation began, they apparently moved their accounting office to a private premises and concealed a computer in an employee’s car for use when needed.

Jonathan Silverman, who was hired in April 2017 to manage Kraken’s institutional sales and trading desk in New York, is demanding compensation in excess of $900,000, according to a suit filed April 4 in New York. That’s based on an agreement Silverman says he reached with Jesse Powell, the San Francisco-based exchange’s founder, who offered him a $150,000 salary and orally agreed to pay him a 10 percent commission of the trading desk’s annual profit. Silverman says the trading desk generated more than $19 million in profits during three months in 2017 and he never received neither the commission nor additional promised stock options.

Silverman “is both lying and in breach of his confidentiality agreement,” said Christina Vee, a spokeswoman for Kraken.

Powell is known in the cryptocurrency world for his outspoken views on what rules should apply to the trading of digital assets. Last year Powell responded to a request by the New York Attorney General for information about his exchange by saying, in part, that ""most crypto traders"" aren’t concerned about ""being protected from market manipulation"" even though “scams are rampant.” Kraken is one of the exchanges that sets prices for CME Group Inc.’s Bitcoin futures contract. Powell has said that Kraken doesn’t have to adhere to New York rules because the firm hasn’t operated in the state for years.

In an April 2018 tweet, Powell said, “We made the wise decision to get the hell out of New York three years ago.” Kraken announced in a 2015 blog post that it discontinued its New York services, citing onerous requirements from the state’s BitLicense, a regulatory framework required by the Department of Financial Services for virtual currency businesses. “Regrettably, the abominable BitLicense has awakened. It is a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth,” the company wrote in the post titled “Farewell, New York.”

Those assertions are challenged in the Silverman lawsuit. Kraken had been “misrepresenting to the public and government regulators that it was not operating in New York; when in reality, Kraken’s OTC practice, and OTC trading (including logging into the Kraken exchange and negotiating wire transfers) occurred almost exclusively in New York,” the filing reads.

“Just because some people in the cryptocurrency space don’t believe the rules apply to them doesn’t mean that’s the way things actually work,” David Silver, one of the attorneys representing Silverman, said in an emailed statement.

Kraken’s New York trading desk is believed to have made the company profit of $19 million between Sept. 15 and year-end 2017, according to a separate suit brought against the company by former employee Robert Adler. After Silverman left the company, he reached an agreement with Kraken that would pay him $907,631 as a lump sum settlement. The lawsuit alleges Kraken “refused” to pay it out despite the agreement.

Silverman was one of at least two employed at Kraken’s New York trading office.

It’s much more common for crypto exchanges to employ internal trading desks that buy and sell on their own market than in the traditional financial world. A New York Attorney General report on crypto exchanges released last year listed several markets, such as Bitfinex, bitFlyer and Poloniex, that reported they allowed the practices on their exchanges.

""That’s the dirty little secret of the crypto exchange world,"" said Richard Johnson, an analyst at Greenwich Associates who specializes in blockchain technology, referring to internal trading desks.",2019-04-08 16:37:38.654,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/paypal-fee-bitcoin-crypto/,"PayPal has recently announced that it will be keeping all seller’s fees when processing a refund going forward. Could such a self-serving policy drive online merchants towards alternate payment networks, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency?

In addition to the seller fee adjustments, PayPal has also announced that it will be altering how it handles intentional payments. Transferring funds from one nation to another used to have a flat fee but will cost a percentage of the total amount transferred. Clearly, any crypto can beat this international transaction fee by more than an insignificant amount.

Could PayPal Angering Users Benefit Crypto?

According to a report in TechSpot, PayPal has infuriated many of its loyal users with its latest changes to its terms and conditions. Previously, the company would take a small set fee of 30c from the seller in each retail transaction occurring on the network, as well as 2.9 percent of the the value of the goods or service sold. If the buyer requested a refund for whatever reason, the set fee would be kept by PayPal whilst the percentage would be refunded to the seller.

In the latest revision of its policies, as of May 7 2019, the international payments processing firm has now made it so that it keeps both the set fee and the percentage of the item’s value when a refund is requested. This is essentially the same as charging a seller for the customer changing their mind about a purchase.

The report in TechSpot highlights the unfairness of the amendment with an example in which a seller must refund a $1,000 purchase, at a cost of $29 to themselves.

Examples such as the recent irking of PayPal users could eventually provide an opportunity for Bitcoin and other cryptos. Essentially, PayPal justifies its fee taking as the cost of ensuring trust between two parties. They act as mediator between two individuals or companies that may not know each other and can charge what they want for the service.

Bitcoin and others cryptos do not rely on a central authority to provide mediation. This role is distributed amongst all the network’s miners and therefore no one party can make any demands on the network’s users, as PayPal can do on a whim.

International Payments Also Incur Fees With PayPal

PayPal also makes money from its users when they send money from one country to another. The firm used to charge a flat fee for this service. However, with the latest terms and condition changes, it has announced that it will now charge a variable fee of five percent. This intentional transaction fee will be no more than $4.99 and no less than 99c.

Since the fee is capped, those sending smaller sums of money are penalised with harsh fees of five percent or even more, whilst those sending huge sums will only pay less than $5 maximum. The real impact of this is that the poorest are effectively charged the most.

Compare this with cryptocurrency. Crypto like Bitcoin does not care which imaginary lines it has to travel across to get to its destination. Sending Bitcoin, Ether, Dash, or Litecoin to your friend sat next to you or to the furthest point around the world from you costs exactly the same. As these payment networks continue to mature, it is likely that the harsh fee structures PayPal get away with imposing will be a thing of the past.

Likewise, crypto cannot withhold services to individuals in the same way that PayPal can and has done previously. Bitcoin is entirely permissionless and censorship-resistant, meaning that no one can stop anyone else from using it.

The transition to the bankruptcy process means Ernst and Young, the court-ordered monitor overseeing the case, will be granted enhanced investigative powers as a trustee under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.

The professional services company now has the right to compel production of documents and testimony from witnesses.

Quadriga Fintech Solutions Corp. and its related companies were granted protection from their creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) on Feb. 5, but it quickly became clear the company had no real assets — and that the process of recovering the missing funds would be difficult.

The exchange stopped operating Jan. 28, more than a month after its lone director — 30-year-old Gerald Cotten, of Fall River, N.S. — died suddenly while travelling in Jaipur, India.

Soon after his death was announced, court documents revealed he was the only QuadrigaCX employee who knew the encrypted passcodes needed to get at $190 million in cryptocurrency locked in offline digital wallets.

Few of those digital assets have been recovered.

Anonymous QuadrigaCX users continue to use social media to trade in wild allegations, rumours and elaborate conspiracy theories.

In a report released last week, Ernst and Young said it had determined Cotten was mixing his personal and corporate finances, though no details were provided.

The report also said Quadriga funds may have been used to buy assets ""held outside the corporate entity."" Again, details were scant.

Still, the monitor asked Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Michael Wood for a so-called asset preservation order, which he granted Monday.

The order applies to all assets held by Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, and the Cotten estate, including some of Robertson's trusts and businesses.

The order prohibits Robertson from selling, removing or transferring any assets. However, it allows her to cover her legal and living expenses by granting her access to two bank accounts overseen by Ernst and Young.

Though the monitor's report said a stay of proceedings would be lifted when the CCAA proceedings were terminated, that stay will be extended under the bankruptcy process.

According to court documents, about $70 million in cash is owed to users, much of which was tied up in bank drafts and accounts held by several third-party payment processors.

Much of Monday's court hearing dealt with Ernst and Young's ongoing efforts to get at that money.

Lawyers for some of those processors, who joined the hearing via teleconference, complained about being given short notice, and at least one lawyer suggested the monitor was overreaching its authority.

Wood asked Ernst and Young and the payment processors to settle their differences before a court hearing scheduled for April 18.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-financial-watchdog-receives-petition-against-crypto-exchange-over-account-closures,"Estonia-based crypto firm Paxful Inc. has been accused of defrauding thousands of Nigerian investors out of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies through allegedly arbitrary account closures.

The news was reported by local media agency Punch on April 7.

According to the report, the Nigerian non-profit organization United Global Resolve for Peace (UGRP) filed a petition on April 2 with the country’s financial watchdog, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which outlines Paxful’s Inc.’s alleged malign practices and their impact on its Nigerian client base.

Signed by UGRP executive director Shalom Olaseni, the petition alleges that:

“Cryptocurrency trading and exchange platform, ‘https://paxful.com’ has been ripping them of their life investment in cryptocurrency by suspending their accounts, deactivating their wallets and refusing to return the value in their accounts to them even after investigation and finding that they were not involved in any fraudulent activities.”

The petition accuses the company of “willful disregard for contract and rules of commercial transaction” in failing to reactivate access to user funds even after purported investigations were found to be groundless.

The petition further claims that Paxful generated $20 million in profit via the exchange in 2018, with Nigerian customers purported to have provided for 40% of the revenue from trades in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies.

One purported victim, Samuel Olanrewaju, told Punch news he had lost access to three BTC (worth ~$15,750 to press time) since November 2018, claiming the firm had falsely accused him of creating a fake user profile, and refused to respond to his queries thereafter.

Paxful has for its part firmly denied its account and wallet closures have been arbitrary, claiming in an email to Punch that “all accounts that have been shut down have a reason for it. We will not shut down any account unless they violate our TOS (Terms of Service).”

Acting EFCC spokesman Tony Orilade confirmed with the news outlet that the watchdog had received the petition and would investigate the allegations.

In March of last year, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) warned Nigerian citizens against the use of cryptocurrencies, noting they are not authorized by Nigeria’s central bank and consequently not insured by the NDIC.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-asian-countries-regulate-cryptocurrency/,"How 5 Asian Countries Regulate Cryptocurrency

The Financial Stability Board has detailed how its member countries regulate crypto assets, who the regulators are, and the scope of their oversight. Most countries have more than one government body monitoring and regulating different aspects of crypto activities. Among the board’s Asian member countries, India is the only one with no legal mandate to directly regulate crypto assets.

India

Three regulators — the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Ministry of Finance — regularly attend the Financial Stability Board (FSB) meetings and G20 summits. The FSB is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. It has listed only the RBI, the country’s central bank, as the regulator of the Indian crypto space, clarifying in a report published Friday:

RBI does not have a legal mandate to directly regulate crypto-assets. RBI’s current mandate permits it to assess financial institutions’ exposure to crypto-assets and supervise their operations.

Within its mandate, the central bank has prohibited financial institutions from dealing in “or providing services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling” cryptocurrencies, the FSB detailed. The three aforementioned regulators are part of the panel headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, tasked with drafting the country’s crypto regulation. According to the government, this panel is in its final stages of deliberations. India’s crypto regulation was expected to be presented to the country’s supreme court on March 29 but the court adjourned without addressing the matter until July.

Japan

At the opposite end of the crypto regulatory spectrum, Japan legalized cryptocurrency as a means of payment back in April 2017 under the amended Payment Services Act.

The main regulator is the Financial Services Agency (FSA) which supervises and conducts oversight of crypto exchange service providers. Crypto exchanges are required to register with the agency. There are currently 19 registered exchanges with over 140 companies interested in entering the market, the regulator has shared with news.Bitcoin.com. The FSA also cooperates with a self-regulatory organization for added oversight. Additionally, the agency engages in international policy discussions on crypto assets and is currently discussing policies on initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Besides the FSA, two other government bodies are involved in the regulation of the Japanese crypto industry: the central bank and the Ministry of Finance.

The Bank of Japan established a fintech center within its Payment and Settlement Systems Department in 2016. The center conducts research on new technologies including cryptocurrency and how they could change existing financial services and structures. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for supervising and legislating crypto assets’ trade under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act including the planning and execution of crypto-related taxation.

South Korea

There are three regulators for crypto activities in South Korea, with the main regulator being the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The Financial Stability Board describes:

The FSC promotes information exchanges and cooperation with international organisations, especially in regard to virtual currency, and is responsible for analysing trends and establishing policies on the digital currency market and for integrating and coordinating policies and major plans of anti-money laundering system related to virtual currency.

Meanwhile, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is responsible for the oversight, market integrity, general anti-fraud and consumer protection of crypto-related activities.

The FSS and the FSC worked together to produce the country’s cryptocurrency measures at the end of 2017 and additional guidelines in January last year. However, they have yet to introduce any follow-up measures. Meanwhile, ICOs are banned from being launched domestically. At least six bills have been submitted to the National Assembly but none have advanced, the FSC previously told news.Bitcoin.com.

The two regulators implemented the real-name system in January last year with the aim to convert all anonymous crypto accounts into real-name-verified ones. In addition, the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit issued reporting guidelines for banks to prevent money laundering via crypto transactions. The country is also working on the taxation of crypto assets.

The last regulator listed for South Korea by the FSB is the central bank. The Bank of Korea monitors and researches the development of crypto assets and their impacts on the economy and financial stability, including the implications of using cryptocurrencies as payment instruments.

Singapore

Despite the country’s early history in the space, the only crypto regulator listed for Singapore is the central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which performs many regulatory functions.

Firstly, it monitors “the prudential exposures of banks, insurance companies and asset managers to crypto-assets.” It also “regulates activities and institutions conducting activities involving cryptoassets if these are capital markets products” under the Securities and Futures Act, the FSB described. Moreover, besides monitoring “the financial stability risks posed by crypto-assets,” the central bank has “extended its surveillance and market intelligence gathering to include crypto-assets.”

The MAS additionally regulates crypto businesses as part of its regulation of payment systems, stored value facilities, remittance businesses and money-changers. The FSB explained that the upcoming Payment Services Act will expand the “MAS’ regulatory reach to cover additional payment activities, including digital payment token services.” It will also set out “regulations for AML/CFT to mitigate risks posed by entities … which conduct crypto-related activities.”

China

Another member of the FSB, China became a hotbed of crypto activity in bitcoin’s early life but then began heavy oversight of the crypto industry, banning crypto exchanges outright in 2017. In addition to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, five other government bodies regulate crypto-related activities in China.

The Cyberspace Administration of China monitors online crypto-related activities and rectifies any problems found. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology prohibits and shuts down illegal crypto-related websites, the FSB noted. Another regulator is the Ministry of Public Security which prohibits crypto activities that are “suspected of illegal criminal activities including illegal fund-raising, fraud and pyramid-schemes.”

Meanwhile, China’s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission “is closely following the development of crypto-assets in China and its potential risk to the banking and insurance system,” the board emphasized. Lastly, the country’s Securities Regulatory Commission, which combats the illegal issuance of securities, “is now strengthening research on the issues of crypto-assets related securities.”

While the mass media warn people not to buy Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency just blasted through its 2019 ATH. The number of google searches for Bitcoin is skyrocketing again as well, especially in these five countries.

1. Nigeria

Any glance at Local Bitcoins trends around the world will quickly show you that BTC has a perfect use case in countries with galloping inflation and dubious governments. Venezuela, Turkey, Kenya, and Nigeria have all started to become aware of ways to shield their wealth from devaluation by buying Bitcoin.

It may be volatile, but even a drop of over 80 percent in a year is nothing compared to Venezuela’s 95 percent in 24 hours or Nigeria’s unpredictable sudden drops.

It’s also relatively easy to pay for things in Bitcoin in Nigeria with plenty of options for its citizens including traditional e-commerce chains.

Finally, the Blockchain Conference Nigeria in Lagos on April 5 could have bumped up those searches, too. Then again, it could just be the fact that savvy Nigerians are gearing up for the next bull-run.

2. Netherlands

The Dutch are getting seriously interested in Bitcoin again. Second on the list with a population of only 17 million.

Why are google searches for bitcoin leaping up like crazy here? One possible factor could be that the scene is growing in the Netherlands. There are countless events and meetups scheduled about blockchain for developers, investors, and the general public alike.

Brock Pierce was all over the news for buying a $1.2 million mansion in Amsterdam in bitcoin.

There is also the European Payments Summit coming up later this month and TNW’s mega tech conference in May with the Hard Fork blockchain track. The rising BTC price? Well, that may have something to do with it as well.

3. South Africa

South Africa is leading the way in Bitcoin usage, the world number one with some 10 percent of its population owning cryptocurrency of some kind.

Citizens here have found buying Bitcoin a practical way of sending money abroad and receiving remittances with reduced fees. With little regulation in the country on cryptocurrency, they are also seeing it as an attractive investment vehicle. This could explain the rise in Google searches for bitcoin.

However, as the Crypto Assets Group formed by the SARB aims to implement stricter KYC/AML requirements this month, perhaps its citizens are also searching to find out the fate of bitcoin in their land.

4. Austria

With the Austria Blockchain Summit in full swing last week attracting speakers, investors, and delegates from around the world, the conference put Vienna on the map.

A large event on blockchain often has an effect on general interest, and often the price, of Bitcoin. In Austria, it seems to have done both.

It will be interesting to see where France comes on the list of google searches for bitcoin next week as the Paris Blockchain Week kicks off.

5. Switzerland

It’s pretty safe to say that most people in Switzerland are not using Bitcoin as a form of hedging against an unstable currency. The Swiss franc is one of the most stable fiat currencies in the world.

Therefore, it’s more likely that the Crypto friendly land and home to Xapo, the biggest Bitcoin custodian, is starting to buy the Bitcoin momentum.

Already the general public is pretty well educated on Bitcoin here. You can buy BTC at every train station. There are Bitcoin ATMs in this tiny land, Zurich’s luxury hotel the Dolder Grand just announced that it will take Bitcoin payments and, of course, Switzerland is home to the famous Crypto valley.

Switzerland’s own ‘Amazon’ Digitec-Galaxus also began accepting Bitcoin for payments last month.

Is the alpine nation starting to feel the FOMO?

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the top economic planning agency in the world’s largest market for bitcoin mining, released on Monday a list of sectors it plans to promote, restrict or eliminate. Crypto mining, the process of creating Bitcoin and other digital currencies through the use of computing power, was namechecked alongside a swarm of other sectors the agency wanted to “eliminate” because they “lacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,” among other issues.

Bitcoin’s valuation famously slumped in 2018, falling from a record $20,000 in December 2017 to below $4,000, but this piece of news from China comes amid a period of renewed optimism. Last week, Bitcoin’s value rocketed above $5,000 for the first time since November 2018.

The official announcement, which comes in the form of a revised list awaiting public comment, does not exert regulatory power. The agency did not put a proposed deadline for when crypto mining should be banned. While such guidelines normally hint at Beijing’s attitude towards an industrial activity, some points out that the NDRC’s guiding list, which renews every few years, has had limited impact on industries it has wanted to cut.

“Items that should be eliminated by end of 2006 are still in the 2011 and 2019 versions,” noted Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, in a tweet.

The ban, if carried out, would deal a massive blow to a series of Chinese companies that rode the crypto wave by providing mining and production tools to the industry. In particular, Bitmain — which recently lets its application for a proposed Hong Kong IPO lapse — would be significantly impacted by a ban. Bitmain’s mining-optimized hardware is widely acknowledged as the top provider of mining hardware, and as much as 94 percent of the company’s revenues in the first half of 2018 came from “Antminers”, its crypto mining hardware.

A spokesperson for Bitmain declined to comment on the news when contacted by TechCrunch.

The crypto sector has drawn close scrutiny from Beijing amid concerns over frauds and speculation, which led to a ban on initial coin offerings in 2017. Meanwhile, environmentalists have protested wasteful energy consumption that bitcoin mining incurs. China was reportedly planning to restrict power supply for some bitcoin miners early last year, according to sources cited by Bloomberg.

This is not the first time China has mulled a clampdown on crypto mining. In January 2018, Beijing was said to ask local governments to discourage bitcoin mining enterprises, according to documents obtained by Chinese financial news publication Yicai. But local officials may be reluctant to embrace such guidance. Much of China’s crypto mining activities happen in its sparse, underdeveloped hinterlands where energy is in the surplus and the governments are eager to boost production. Whether the new order coming from the powerful NDRC will put further deterrent on the industry is up in the air.",2019-04-09,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-falls-after-china-signals-it-wants-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-2019-4,"Reuters/Dado Ruvic

Bitcoin slid 2% after China's state planner added bitcoin mining to a draft list of activities it wants to ban, according to Reuters.

The decision comes as the Chinese government continues to crack down on cryptocurrency trading exchanges, cryptomining, and new cryptocurrencies.

China is the world's largest market for bitcoin-mining equipment and home to major manufacturers such as Bitmain and Canaan.

Bitcoin has surged by more than 25% since the start of April, passing the $5,000 mark for the first time since mid-November.

The price of bitcoin slid 2% after China's state planner put bitcoin mining on its chopping block. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) added the budding industry to a draft list of industrial activities it wants to ban, according to Reuters, signaling the Chinese government's growing dissatisfaction with cryptocurrency.

The NDRC is seeking comment from the Chinese public on a revised list of industries that it plans to promote, restrict, or eliminate. It added bitcoin mining — harnessing computer-processing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify cryptocurrency transactions, in exchange for new bitcoins — to a list of more than 450 activities that it considers to be unsafe, a waste of resources, or damaging to the environment. However, it didn't provide a timeline for phasing out the industry.

The global bitcoin industry uses an estimated 42 terawatt hours of electricity a year — close to the amount consumed annually by the entire nation of Bangladesh. China is the world's largest market for bitcoin-mining equipment and home to major manufacturers such as Bitmain and Canaan.

Its bitcoin industry has faced growing pressure since 2017, according to Reuters, when regulators began shuttering cryptocurrency trading exchanges, restricting mining, and banning ""initial coin offerings"" where new cryptocurrencies are debuted.

At $5,204, the price of bitcoin has surged by more than 25% since the start of April, passing the $5,000 mark for the first time since mid-November without a clear catalyst. A Chinese crackdown on mining could reduce the supply of new bitcoin, driving prices higher. However, it could also fan fears of regulatory intervention and temper hopes of sector growth, dampening demand.

Many Bitcoin advocates see a need for greater transparency, environmental accountability, and a crackdown on fraud in the wild west of cryptocurrency markets. Skeptics will counter that the Chinese government is attacking bitcoin mining because it's wary of any industry that it doesn't control. The Chinese public may have a dilemma on its hands.

But as Bitcoin price finds new life, lawmakers in the country are considering banning crypto mining among 450 other activities that are deemed to be unsafe, wasteful of natural resources, or pollute the environment.

The news is largely viewed as FUD in the crypto community, who have become accustomed to China threatening crypto in the past. Others believe that the news is actually bullish for Bitcoin, and could help the first every cryptocurrency become more decentralized.

Crypto Community Sounds Off On China Bitcoin Mining Ban

South China Morning Post reports that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has revealed a draft list of industrial activities the government is interested in restricting or outright banning, which include cryptocurrency mining.

Due to China dominating the Bitcoin mining industry, both in terms of the actual mining of BTC, as well as manufacturing the rigs that support the activity elsewhere, the entire crypto industry was up in arms this morning following the breaking news.

Of course, China fears bring out the trolls. Let's be clear: China banning PoW mining doesn't mean they are banning rig manufacture. It doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin. You'd think that maximalist trolls would have higher confidence and thicker skin. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019

Cornell University professor and founder of Ava Labs Emin Gun Sirer took to Twitter to dispel the FUD, and clear up any confusion over what it means for Bitcoin. As he points out, manufacturing mining rigs won’t end, and the news certainly doesn’t mean “the end of Bitcoin.” Other crypto analysts and investors, simply shrugged off the news.

China has repeatedly flip-flopped its position on cryptocurrencies, but overall hasn’t been welcoming to the new financial technology and emerging asset class.

What Does the China Mining Ban Mean for Bitcoin Price?

Sirer suggests that previous “China FUD” has resulted in bullish price action in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but calls the effects of the recent news “pretty weak.”

Historically, news of this kind (aka ""China FUD"") has been correlated with price upticks. Though as far as consumer-affecting FUD goes, this is pretty weak. The impact is on miners, not regular users. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019

BTC has continued to range below resistance at $5,300 after a nearly $1,000 rally early last week, that began once Bitcoin broke $4,200. The price has remained mostly stable despite the largest source of BTC mining potentially being barred from the activity.

Litecoin, for instance, recorded a staggering 208% increase in value since January — outperforming most crypto assets apart from a handful, including Binance Coin and Enjin Coin.

After experiencing a slight retracement, Bitcoin along with Ethereum and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are showing signs of new momentum, with BTC recently breaching $5,200.

What caused the initial rally on April 1?

The rally of Bitcoin in the first week of April is said to have been triggered by four major factors:

Absorption of an $80 million sell wall at a key resistance in $4,200. The liquidation of short contracts worth $500 million. Lack of resistance above $4,200. The reported purchase by one buyer of $100 million worth of Bitcoin

Around $500m in liquidations on Bitmex alone, ouch

The $4,200 resistance level has been a roadblock for the near-term recovery of Bitcoin since January, and every attempt to break out of it led the price of BTC dipping below $4,000. As soon as the crucial resistance level was breached cleanly for the first time in 2019, Bitcoin began to move up rapidly toward $5,000.

But, one potentially overlooked factor in analyzing the price trend of Bitcoin in the beginning of April may have been the dominance of Bitcoin futures markets based in the U.S.

Due to the relatively small volume of major futures markets such as CME Group, the impact of futures on the price trend of Bitcoin was believed to be minimal by many.

Danny Les, a former hedge fund manager, told Cointelegraph in February that the downside movement of Bitcoin two months ago was not likely to have been affected by futures:

“I don’t think futures closing made a difference. Just like when the CME Bitcoin markets kicked off and everyone expected it would have a huge effect on price. It didn’t. Same applies here as far as I’m concerned.”

However, on March 22, Bitwise Asset Management disclosed in its presentation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that 35% of Bitcoin trading volume in February was processed through CME and CBOE futures.

“And, when you remove fake volume, CME and CBOE futures volume is significant ($91M), especially compared to the real spot volume (35% for Feb 2019). This is good news because it means CME — a regulated, surveilled market — is of material size, which important for an ETF.”

From March 4 to 8, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, processed $110 million worth of Bitcoin trades. In the same time frame, according to Bitwise’s report, CME and CBOE processed $91 million.

At least until March, the volume of Bitcoin futures markets in the U.S. neared that of the Bitcoin volume of the biggest exchange in the global cryptocurrency market.

In the future, with CBOE’s reported pullout from the Bitcoin futures market, the share of the futures market in the volume of BTC could change, but in the general scheme of things, Bitwise has shown that futures markets can no longer be dismissed when analyzing the price of Bitcoin.

What can stimulate the next rally?

The liquidation of short contracts and the large volume coming from U.S.-based futures markets were crucial in fueling the momentum of Bitcoin in early April, acting as near-term price catalysts.

Bitcoin has not been in the $5,000 region since early November, and pushing through September and October levels in the $6,000 to $7,000 range would require proper fundamental and technical factors to gain new momentum.

Purely based on fundamentals, the block reward halving of the Bitcoin network that is expected to occur in May 2020 could have an impact on the price of the asset in the near-term.

Historically, as several analysts suggested, the price of Bitcoin has tended to increase in value about a year before its halving.

Historical data shows that about a year before the halving, the cost of Bitcoin starts to go up.



In 2012 and 2016, the exchange rate occurred 376 and 320 days before the halving of the miners reward.#cryptocurrency #bitcoin #btc #Trader #crypto #trading $btc pic.twitter.com/i1SQVBYXy7 — Gems Caller (@gemscaller) March 29, 2019

Arguments against the halving theory certainly exist due to the rising mainstream awareness of Bitcoin and its halving mechanism. The main argument is that, because halving is already anticipated by investors, it may not have a noticeable effect on the price.

But, Bitcoin is nearing its fixed supply of 21 million and the restriction the halving would put on the circulating supply of the asset is highly likely to affect the price of the asset, especially if the demand remains at the current level or even rises in the months to come.

So far, 84% of the fixed supply of Bitcoin has already been issued, and several reports from firms such as Chainalysis have shown that a few million BTC could be lost permanently.

In late 2017, Fortune exclusively reported that 4 million BTC is estimated to be lost permanently, possibly from hacking attacks, loss of private keys and many other reasons.

At the time, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at Chainalysis, said that it is difficult to conclusively state that the lost BTC is priced into the market because the projected market cap of Bitcoin does not consider BTC that is out of circulation:

“That is a very complex question. On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity. Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available — just look at exchange behavior. Furthermore, it is well known monetary policy procedure to lower or increase fiat reserves to impact exchange rates. So the answer is yes and no.”

Considering the relatively large portion of the supply of BTC and the upcoming halving that would further slow down the rate at which new BTC is mined and would significantly reduce the available supply of the asset, an overall increase in value can be expected.

Independent price movements show maturation of the crypto market

In many areas, as ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees stated, crypto is maturing.

Crypto is maturing. It is now firmly in its adolescence. — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) March 29, 2019

In terms of industry development, regulation, merchant adoption, infrastructure building and security, the cryptocurrency industry has seen significant progress in recent months.

Another strong indicator of the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market is the emergence of independent price movements.

In the past four months, a fairly large number of crypto assets — such as Litecoin, Enjin Coin, Binance Coin, Augur, Ontology, Cardano and EOS — have shown price movements independent from that of BTC.

Throughout history, at least in recent years, alternative cryptocurrencies have demonstrated the tendency to record intensified movements based on the direction of Bitcoin. However, since January, many cryptocurrencies have been less dependent on BTC to initiate upside movements.

It is entirely possible that the stability of the dominant cryptocurrency provided investors in the cryptocurrency market with the confidence to take higher-risk opportunities to invest in lower market cap tokens.

Investors also may have found the lower valuations of tokens, most of which fell by 90% to 98% against the USD at its lowest point during the 16-month correction, compelling enough to invest in the market.

Factors like April 1’s short squeeze are necessary

Ultimately, for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the rest of the cryptocurrency market to engage in a new rally following an impressive 20% gain in the past week, strong stimuli such as last week’s short squeeze or the investment of nearly $100 million by a single buyer are needed.

One caution of strategists, however, is that Bitcoin may be overbought.

David Tawil, president of crypto hedge fund ProChain Capital, told Bloomberg that, while a positive move is “nice to see,” he would be more comfortable with BTC climbing up gradually to key resistance levels rather than with a big, short-term spike, which may leave the asset vulnerable to a retest of previous levels.",,https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302053/bitcoin-dealer-prison-jail-sentence-unlicensed-cryptocurrency-exchange,"A 22-year-old man has been sentenced to two years in prison for selling unlicensed bitcoins. His crime was operating a bitcoin exchange without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the US Department of Treasury.

Jacob Burrell Campos, a US citizen and Mexico resident, has been held in custody without bail since August 2018. He pleaded guilty in October 2018, admitting that he employed no anti-money laundering measures and didn’t check up on details about his customers and where their money came from.

Burrell wasn’t accused of explicitly committing criminal activities such as stealing or scamming clients, but simply having an unlicensed exchange was enough to earn him two years in prison. Burrell advertised his business on localbitcoins.com and often used encrypted apps to text his customers. He sold bitcoins at 5 percent above the usual exchange rate and received payments in cash, potentially making his service attractive to money-launderers.

Burrell started off with a legal exchange, but his account was soon shut down for suspicious transactions

Burrell claims to have started as a customer of a US-based, regulated bitcoin exchange, but saw his account shut down after a large volume of suspicious transactions raised red flags. He then turned to Bitfinex, an exchange in Hong Kong that is also being investigated by US authorities, before finally launching his own illegal exchange in 2016. During those years, Burrell exchanged his US cash that he stored in Mexico with an accomplice who dealt in precious metals, and together they imported over $1 million in cash into the US.

The US Justice Department has ruled that Burrell gave his clients “anonymity and privacy and exchanged over $1 million in unregulated cash,” potentially allowing criminals to launder cash without scrutiny.",2019-04-09,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-could-absolutely-crash-below-3000-crypto-pioneer/,"

Crypto entrepreneur Vinny Lingham said that he can ""absolutely"" see the bitcoin price crashing back below $3,000. | Source: Shutterstock

Bitcoin’s April rally has captured the attention of observers both inside and outside crypto–land, with the price perched above $5,200 once again. Blockchain pioneers are confronting the pop, even if they have different views on what it means.

Vinny Lingham, who is at the helm of blockchain identity platform Civic, isn’t convinced that crypto winter is over and wouldn’t be surprised to watch the price retrace its former lows. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, meanwhile, is an unapologetic bitcoin bull who sees all of the signs that it’s onward and upward from here.

The blockchain leaders are on opposite sides of the bitcoin bull market spectrum. They each joined CNBC’s Crypto Trader Ran NeuNer to discuss what’s next for the bitcoin price.

Lingham: ‘Absolutely’ a Chance Bitcoin Price Could Dip to New Lows

Lingham, who maintained a conservative bitcoin price outlook throughout the bear market, isn’t tossing that winter coat just yet. The Civic chief is not convinced that crypto winter is over, saying he is waiting for the bitcoin price to hold a particular level before he’s ready to concede that the bears have lost control.

“I’m not buying any bounce right now that doesn’t go to around $6,200 and stays there for at least 24-48 hours as being the end of the bear market cycle.”

While Lingham is willing to suggest that the bitcoin price is near the bottom of the bear market cycle, it could have more bouncing to go. Historically, bitcoin hasn’t escaped a bear market until the price is two times higher than the bottom. Considering that the bitcoin price bottom of the current cycle is $3,100, the cryptocurrency will have the “all clear” when it holds $6,200.

“If you look at the historical charts, roughly 2x is when the sentiment has been shown to be changed. And then we’re in an upward momentum,” said Lingham.

Even the most bullish bitcoin price outlooks entertain the possibility that it could be one step forward, two steps back for BTC. Lingham isn’t alone.

“There’s absolutely a chance we could go below $3,000. I don’t think the bear market cycle is necessarily over,” said Lingham, pointing to the critical level of $6,200.

Otherwise, Lingham believes that the bitcoin price will be “stuck in purgatory” as it trades the narrow range of $5,700-$6,200 for a while.

Lingham, incidentally, is also a general partner at Multicoin Capital Management where their $100 million-plus fund includes a long position on Binance Coin (BNB). Speak of the devil.

CZ: ‘People Are Not Scared Away’

As the head of crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, sees the crypto market from a completely different vantage point. In fact, he’s been called the “most bullish person in the industry,” and there’s a reason for it. He said of the April bitcoin price pump:

“The fact that the price can go up so quickly means that there was a lot of money waiting to buy bitcoin and they were really fearing missing out, the FOMO mentality. So the fact that the price can go up so quickly means the money was ready which basically means that people still have a lot of confidence in this industry. It’s not like everyone is scared away.”

If you need more evidence that the bitcoin price is in a bull market, consider the anecdotal evidence. Binance orders are at an all-time high, stablecoin deposits are up, and new user registrations have “jumped.”

“Every piece of data we have is going up right now,” said CZ.

The browser, called “Reborn 3,” is now available for the Mac, Windows and Linux operating systems, Opera announced Tuesday. The software allows users to explore and interact with the blockchain-based decentralized applications (dapps) of “Web 3,” and the wallet lets users send transactions without requiring an extension such as Metamask, the browser company said.

To enhance security, Reborn 3’s built-in wallet syncs with that of Opera’s mobile Android browser, which was launched last December, Opera said.

“This means wallet keys never leave the users’ smartphones,” the company said, adding: “In practice, whenever they need to identify themselves to a Web 3 website or sign a transaction on the blockchain, users get a notification on their smartphone. They can confirm it in the same way they unlock their system, using, for example, facial recognition or their fingerprint.”

Opera said it is also planning to add the built-in crypto wallet feature to its iOS browser, known as Opera Touch, soon.

Oslo, Norway-based Opera first revealed the development of its Web 3 Android browser last July. The browser currently supports ether and other tokens using ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. Crypto collectibles minted under the ERC-721 standard, such as CryptoKitties, are also supported.

Earlier this year, Opera allowed Android users to buy ether directly from its browser-based wallet, in partnership with regulated cryptocurrency brokerage Safello.

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) awarded Bitstamp the 19th BitLicense Tuesday, allowing the exchange to offer bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash, ether and XRP trading pairs to the state’s residents. Bitstamp first applied for the license in June 2015, when NYDFS created the state’s landmark law.

The exchange was among the first set of 22 applicants for the license, CEO Nejc Kodrič told CoinDesk.

While the regulator only issued a handful of licenses in its first few years, awarding BitLicenses – which NYDFS has recently taken to calling “virtual currency licenses” instead – appears to be “becoming more routine to them,” Kodrič said. “This year we are the [fifth] that was granted so I guess the pace is picking up.”

So far in 2019, prime brokerage Tagomi, stock trading app Robinhood and bitcoin ATM operators Cottonwood Vending and LibertyX have received the coveted license.

To get to this point, Bitstamp and NYDFS have discussed various aspects of the exchange’s operation, Kodrič said, explaining:

“There were questions all around how the matching engine works, how we store crypto, how we [conduct] audits. The license is a set of rules and procedures you have to follow on a daily basis, so once you do that you can [receive a BitLicense].”

The CEO likened the approval process to Europe’s standards: the exchange already has a payment institution license in the EU, allowing it to operate across all 28 member countries.

“The [BitLicense] is not that much different than our financial services license that we have in Europe,” he said. “We didn’t reinvent the wheel.”

Now the exchange, which already offers some services within the U.S., is looking to expand its operations. Kodrič explained that the company primarily operated in European markets to date, but has been “passive” so far in America.

However, he noted, Bitstamp’s U.S. operations began before the BitLicense was finalized (the exchange was first founded in 2011), and as such, did have a presence in the country.

“We were providing services in the [US] including New York before there were any licenses out there,” he said. “We have many customers from the States, but we plan on going more active.”

While right now the license only allows Bitstamp to offer the five listed cryptocurrencies to U.S. customers, he hinted that this is not a firm limitation.

The exchange is primarily a crypto-to-fiat platform, though it does offer crypto-to-crypto services. At present, though, the majority of its volume comes from its fiat on and off ramps.

According to asset manager Bitwise’s list of exchanges with legitimate volume, Bitstamp ranks within the top four, though according to CoinMarketCap’s list of exchanges by reported volume, it weighs in at number 56.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)unveiled amendments to its guidance for adjustments to the nation's industrial structure, including categories that are encouraged, restricted and eliminated. Cryptocurrency mining was included among sectors to be eliminated immediately. The new list is under public consultation until May 7.

China has been home to the biggest crypto mining companies in the world, with about 70% of the mining activity happening in the country. The draft did not specify a time frame or plan for eliminating mining activities in the country.

The government body recommended that cryptocurrency mining should be eliminated in the country as it is a waste of resources.

Cryptocurrency mining is the process of validating transactions in digital forms of money like bitcoin and ethereum in exchange for new coins given as a reward. The specialised computers used for the mining activity consume large amounts of electricity. This mining has been known to be energy intensive, with some countries and regions around the world adopting several measures to curb the activity.

China is home to some of the world's largest cryptocurrency mining farms - data centres hosting the mining rigs - thanks to cheap electricity in the country's coal-rich Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia regions.

The rules enacted in 2005 in China makes it illegal for Chinese citizens to invest in the eliminated industries. During the elimination period, authorities have the right to raise electricity prices to force those businesses to shut down their operations. In addition to this, the manufacturing, sale, and use of products related to the eliminated industries is also prohibited.

This is not the first time authorities have cracked down on cryptocurrency mining. Authorities started clamping down on crypto activities in the country from late 2017 when it announced an outright ban on exchange services, which drove a slew of crypto wallets and trading platforms abroad. In early 2018, regulators decided to lower the incentives for crypto mining without banning the practice entirely.

The industry has begun shifting overseas as the crackdown is set to intensify. Market leader Bitmain Technologies - which in March allowed its application for a Hong Kong initial public offering to lapse - has established mining operations in the US and Canada.

Over the course of just a few hours on April 2, the price of Bitcoin leaped up from roughly $4110 to $4800; from there, it has continued to climb to its current price of approximately $5260. Over the same period, Litecoin has also gained about 50 percent of its value; Bitcoin Cash has increased by roughly 80 percent since the 1st of the month.

Discover Barcelona Trading Conference – A Top Tier Crypto Trading Event

All in all, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has seen an increase from around $144 billion to over $181 billion. Bitcoin dominance has remained more or less the same since the beginning of the month, suggesting that investors are bullish on the market as a whole rather than just BTC.

So, what gives? Why–after months of downward pressure on crypto prices–are cryptocurrencies recovering now? And what does this mean for the future?

The Big Trade that Started it All

A number of theories have emerged as to why cryptocurrency prices initially surged–some of them rather far-fetched. However, Gabriel Dusil, Co-Founder and General Manager at blockchain technology incubator Adel, told Finance Magnates that there are some very logical reasons that Bitcoin is doing so well at the moment.

“BTC spiked over 5k due to trading activity,” Dusil said, adding that “someone bought $100 million worth of BTC through several exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp).”

Indeed, BCB Group’s Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie was quoted by Reuters on April 2, speaking on this mammoth order: “there has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC. If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour.”

Von Landsberg-Sadie also said that the trade was likely executed by an “automated software set” (an algorithmic trading bot.)

What may have caused this buyer to suddenly pump $100 million into BTC? Of course, it’s impossible to know the truth. However, Dusil believes that one catalyst may have been the revelations published in a presentation that Bitwise Asset Management made to the SEC. The presentation claimed that 95 percent of trading volume in the Bitcoin market is fake and that as such, BTC’s average daily trading volume is just $272 million.

With this revelation, “we are set back to 2017 volumes,” Dusil said. “This could be a reason why fresh capital is going into crypto”–investors may see a much more significant opportunity for growth in BTC than before.

A ‘Halving’ Rally

Another factor that may have caused Bitcoin’s upward movement has to do with the mining rewards ‘halving’ that will take place in May of 2020. “BTC rewards are soon halving,” Dusil explained. “The closer we get to May 2020, the more it will be discussed and spark interest to buy BTC and try to accumulate it for the future, when BTC will be harder to mine and, as with any scarce product, the price blooms.”

‘Halving’ literally means that mining rewards for Bitcoin holders will be cut in half. This has occurred twice so far in Bitcoin’s history – once in 2012 and once in 2016.

Indeed, a CoinDesk report entitled “Bitcoin’s Next Halving Rally: Coming Soon in 2019” that was published in December of last year explained that “historically, the halving starts getting priced in approximately one year before it happens, which would result in bitcoin bottoming out in early 2019 followed by a rally starting in May 2019.”

The report points out that in the year-long period preceding the other two ‘halvenings,’ price rallies drove the price of Bitcoin to unprecedented heights.

Speculation, Speculation

Dusil said that the third reason is simply hype. Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have made positive movement lately, speculators believe that they may be able to cash in on the bullish wave.

However, it’s still too soon to tell how long any meaningful new capital will stay in the space. The Bitcoin market is very different than it was in late 2017 when the last massive bull run happened. Practically no one had even heard of Bitcoin in those days; the upward spiral that closed out the year was primarily fueled by ignorance and blind optimism.

Now, people have wised up. After seeing the spectacular market crash that took place at the beginning of 2018, most of the world is much more skeptical about pouring their cash into Bitcoin.

On the flip side, however, Bitcoin’s base-line price may have been made more stable by the influx of institutional capital and a new group of long-term ‘hodlers’ into the market. The risk that Bitcoin could go to ‘zero’ has been lessened by the industry that has been built around the asset.

Institutional Capital Could Be Part of the Upward Movement

The role of institutional capital in the Bitcoin market may also have seriously contributed to the recent rally. On April 5th, eToro analyst Mati Greenspan tweeted that “the CME bitcoin futures traded about $563 million yesterday.@MessariCrypto reports that the top 10 exchanges traded about $685 million.”

A report by Chepicap explained that “effectively this means that the CME alone cites a massive 82% of the trading volume of the top 10 crypto exchanges combine.”

Therefore, although Greenspan acknowledged that “Wall Street’s contracts are only paper, and not settled in bitcoin,” Wall Street still acts as an important influencing force for BTC: “they are still a significant part of this market now.”

Is China Back in the BTC Market?

According to a report by NewsBTC, another factor that may be driving up the price of Bitcoin and the crypto markets as a whole is the re-rentry of Chinese investors into the market.

“Don’t ask us how, but locals are ‘FOMOing’ in so hard that they’re skirting local regulations to get their hands on BTC,” the report said.

According to a tweet by local industry insider CnLedger, one of the in-roads that Chinese buyers may be using to get their hands on BTC is OTC (over the counter) trading venues.

Effects of the Bull Run

Bitcoin’s bull run hasn’t only filled the wallets of hodlers. Several days after Bitcoin’s initial spike, Bloomberg reported that crypto stocks have also gotten a big boost.

According to the report, “crypto-linked stocks in Asia also extended gains, led by Remixpoint Inc. in Japan with a jump of as much as 16 percent during the day Thursday. It’s up 26 percent so far this week. Vidente Co. has climbed almost 20 percent since the weekend, while Omintel Inc. is on a 6.3 percent advance.”

The rally has also been felt in US stocks–Riot Blockchain Inc. saw a 24-percent boost last week, while DPW Holdings Inc. and Marathon Patent Group Inc. (two smaller crypto firms) saw gains of their own.

Usually, an increase in the price of Bitcoin is echoed in the price of other altcoins. But as the crypto ecosystem continues to grow outside of coin market caps, boosts in the price of Bitcoin are increasingly having a positive effect on these external entities–a sign of the times if there ever was one.

What Does This All Mean?

But is the rally here to stay? And do the price increases we’ve seen so far mean anything in the bigger picture?

For Dusil, the answer is ‘not exactly.’

“This spike doesn’t mean we are in a bullish trend, we need to look at longterm picture and that shows we are in a correction,” he said. “Price can as easily drop down as it can go up. Those who were buying in 2/2 of 2017 are still in loss. We need to see prices at 8k area to say we are in recovery and a bullish trend has [truly] been established.”

But still, the Bitcoin market isn’t far from reaching some serious milestones. “If we break through 6k, it means bears are losing their power and bulls are entering.”

However, investors must be wary of the speculation that this might bring. “This also means all who bought BTC at 3.2k will get a nice 100% return on their investment, which can spark debates in public areas, and we all know what can happen when people start saying they made 100% in just few months.”

If the rally continues, legendary prices could eventually become a reality. “If we break 8k, we can say the bullish sentiment is back and we are on our way to all-time high. At the 12k area, we could see the start of FOMO (fear of missing out) that could bring new speculators in, and with fresh capital in crypto, we could see the prices surpassing the 2017 heights,” Dusil explained.

But until then–don’t hold your breath, kids.",2019-04-10 09:23:47+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-new-policy-isnt-an-automatic-bitcoin-mining-ban-heres-why,"The Takeaway:

A draft proposal from China’s economic planning commission labels bitcoin mining as an industry that needs to be “eliminated.” But even if finalized in its current form, this would not automatically amount to an outright mining ban.

While local governments are supposed to follow the commission’s guidance, to take action against an industry they need a basis in the laws of the state, not industrial policy.

Further, there are past examples of “undesirable” industries that were eventually recategorized because phasing them out was found to conflict with local interests.

Seizing on this, miners are arguing that eliminating their industry would also conflict with local interests, in part because they soak up excess electricity that would otherwise go to waste.

One of these things is not like the others.

On Sept. 4, 2017, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), together with six other central government agencies and financial regulators, banned initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Later that month, regulators ordered the country’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down.

And on April 8 of this year, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top macroeconomic planner and one of 26 cabinet-level agencies which form the State Council, published a draft proposal to amend the Catalog for Guiding Industrial Restructure.

The proposed revision, still pending public consultation, classifies “virtual currency mining, such as the production process of bitcoin” as an industry category that’s undesirable and to be eliminated, together with hundreds of other sectors.

The news was widely covered, with most media outlets leaping to the conclusion that China now wants to ban cryptocurrency mining, just as it did in 2017 with ICOs and domestic spot trading.

But to call this policy a “ban” in the same sense is misleading at best. The reality is more nuanced, and requires additional context to fully understand.

Below, CoinDesk takes a close look at the history of the NDRC’s policy recommendations to clarify what this latest guidance really means – and why it does not automatically amount to an outright ban.

A provision and a catch

The NDRC first published its catalog in 2005, grouping industrial sectors into three types – those the agency advises the country to encourage, restrict or eliminate.

It defined those to be eliminated as industries that have obsolete techniques, products, and technology, or which are unlawful, unsafe, wasteful or pollutive.

The purpose of the catalog is to serve as a macro-level economic policy to guide local governments on how to allocate their investment and resources to balance local economic growth with overall stability.

To give such policy a legal status, the State Council promulgated an “Interim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment” for implementation in December 2005.

According to a translation by LexisNexis (full document included at the end of this article), Article 19 of the Interim Provisions clarifies what local governments shall do with industries that are categorized as to be eliminated.

“[Government] Investments are prohibited from being contributed to projects of the eliminated category. All financial institutions shall stop various forms of credit granting supports to such projects, and take measures to recover the granted loans,” the Article reads, adding:

“If any enterprise of the eliminated category refuses to eliminate the production technique, equipment or products, the local people’s government at each level and the relevant administrative department shall, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the state, order it to stop production or close it.”

Therefore, indeed, local governments are required to take proper actions to implement what’s outlined in the NDRC’s policy guide.

But there’s a notable catch: the part about “the relevant laws and regulations of the state.”

Kai Xu, a legal practitioner in China with expertise in corporate governance and compliance, explained to CoinDesk that local governments must use related laws and regulations – not the Interim Provisions itself – as a legal basis to take forceful actions to shut down “undesirable” companies.

For instance, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently published a provision for administrative penalty when regulating businesses like internet advertising and e-commerce.

It outlines who is entitled to take forceful administrative actions against companies violating regulations, what the penalties are and how they should be carried out.

“Because such an action is an administrative penalty, it must have a legal ground first,” Xu said. “It’s currently unclear [how or what types of laws bitcoin mining should fall under].”

He added that the legal nature of the NDRC’s policy is different from that of the ICO ban announced by the central bank in 2017 (which clearly defined the nature of ICOs as an illegal activity, meaning any entity that still engages in that activity is subject to legal actions).

“The former is an industry policy and the latter is a departmental regulatory document,” he said.

Local interest

Also importantly, the State Council emphasized at the top of the 2005 Interim Provisions that local governments, when implementing the industrial policy, are also required to balance the government guidance and the functions of the market as well as local interests.

It states:

“The relevant governments and departments shall, when implementing the ‘Interim Provisions’, correctly deal with the relationship between government guidance and market regulation, give full play to the fundamental role of the market in allocating resources, correctly deal with the relationship between development and stability, that between partial interests and overall interests, and that between immediate interests and long-term interests, so as to keep the stable and fast development of the economy.”

Xu told CoinDesk that if the final form of the policy guide includes bitcoin mining as a category to be eliminated, it will be the job of local governments and relevant departments to implement actual executional plans.

But he also pointed out there is always the possibility that a policy will not be enforced or implemented in the end, adding:

“There are many reasons to that, since executions are carried out by human beings, after all. And there may also be information costs during implementation, as well as conflicts with local interest.”

And members of the local mining community have also raised questions about whether it’s reasonable to label bitcoin mining as an industry to be eliminated, arguing that such a decision could potentially conflict with local interest.

Alex Ao, founder of Innosilicon, which manufactures cryptocurrency mining equipment, said in China’s Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and southwestern provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan, there is excessive electricity generated every year that can neither be fully consumed by local demand nor be integrated to the State Grid to be transmitted to regions outside.

For instance, the Garze prefecture government in Sichuan has said that in 2017 alone, hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity thanks to the rainy season in the summer.

But a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh went to waste due to not enough local consumption, which resulted in a direct economic loss of some 4 billion yuan, or $600 million, for local hydropower companies.

Tyler Xiong, chief marketing officer of Bixin, which operates a mining pool and wallet service, echoed that sentiment.

“First, bitcoin mining doesn’t result in pollution. It actually helps consume excessive electricity [generated by local plants] that would otherwise go to waste. And it creates jobs and revenue locally,” he said. “Eliminating that could conflict with local interest because it can benefit the local economy.”

The public now has until May 7 to submit feedback on the NDRC draft proposal. While it’s unclear when the final version will be published, the draft comes at a time when Chinese bitcoin miners have been investing to scale up their mining capacity to capture on the cheap electricity during the summer.

What happened before?

It’s worth noting that the NDRC had published and revised the policy guide multiple times over the past decade. What happened to some of the industries that were previously labeled as to be eliminated?

While it is difficult to grasp a full picture of the actual implementation over the years, one article from the People’s Daily in 2006 described certain issues local governments in Hebei encountered when eliminating energy-intensive sectors such as cement manufacturing, following the 2005 policy guide.

The article cited a comment from an official from the NDRC, explaining the policy guide was not a legal basis for taking forceful actions to shut down companies.

“It must be done in accordance to relevant laws,” the official said, a point echoed by Xu above.

In the cement-making instance, the article said most local governments used laws and regulations relating to land resources and environment management as a legal basis for taking actions.

And there are also examples where certain items were first marked for elimination, but later removed from the category, thanks to feedback gathered during implementation.

For example, in 2011, the production equipment for manufacturing cold-rolled ribbed bar (a material used in construction) was classified as a sector that should be eliminated.

In a revised version in 2013, the NDRC adjusted the wording to specify that only certain types of cold-rolled ribbed bar equipment with productivity below a threshold should be eliminated.

The NDRC explained in a separate note that the reason for the revision was because during implementation, the industry had provided feedback that there was still a considerable amount of domestic demand for cold-rolled ribbed bar making.

After gathering and studying such feedback with relevant government departments, the Commission agreed that some equipment with higher productivity and efficiency should be kept.

None of this is to downplay the attitude shown in the policy guide from the NDRC, which clearly voices a stance of not supporting cryptocurrency mining in China.

Yet the main questions that are now in the air is whether the final form of the policy will still include bitcoin mining in the “undesirable” category, and if so, how lawmakers and local governments will carry out the implementation – especially when it conflicts with potential local interest.

The smart money sells when the whole market and especially the retail players are overly bullish. Similarly, these large players enter the markets when the sentiment is bearish and people are waiting to dump their positions. After the extended bear market and huge erosion in prices, retail traders are wary of entering the crypto markets.

The total Bitcoin trading volume has been on a decline for the past few months but the institutional players seem to be accumulating at the lower levels. The trades by institutions, when compared to the total volume, have increased from 15 percent in January of this year to 19 percent in April, according to a report by Diar.

Back in July of last year, institutional trades rose to 24 percent of the total but it soon petered out with the breakdown of the $5,900 support on Bitcoin. The current rise in volume shows that institutions are confident of a recovery this time.

Facebook is seeking up to $1 billion in venture capital to develop its digital currency — rumored to be a stablecoin that will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies — according to the New York Times. These developments show that serious money is waiting to invest in the nascent asset class at every available opportunity. Will this result in a sustained uptrend or will the rally fizzle out again? Let’s look at the charts.

BTC/USD

After a minor correction on April 9, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to resume its recovery. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. Deeply overbought readings on the RSI warn that the up-move is getting overextended. However, if such a reading is seen during the rally after an extended downtrend, it suggests that the bulls are unwilling to book profits after a short upswing and a trend change is in the offing.

Above $5,309.31, the BTC/USD pair can rally to $5,674.84 and if this level is crossed, the next major barrier is $5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at $5,900, hence, traders can book profits on the remaining long positions between $5,600 and $5,900.

Contrary to our expectation, if the pair reverses direction from the current levels, it can drop to the $4,914.11–$4,800 support zone. If this zone also fails to provide support, the next stop is the 20-day EMA. We expect this level to hold. Hence, traders can keep a stop loss of $4,600 for now.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) has been sustaining above the breakout level of $167.32 for the past three days, which is a bullish sign. As it has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, it has a target objective of $251.64.

Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in a strong position.

Any correction from the current levels will find support at $167.32 and below it at the 20-day EMA. We expect the ETH/USD pair to bounce from one of these support levels. Hence, we have recommended a stop loss of $150 on the remaining long position. If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA and below it to the trendline of the ascending triangle. We will raise the stops again in a couple of days.

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) continues to trade in a tight range. It has been taking support close to $0.350 for the past four days. A breakdown of this level can drag the price to the support at $0.33108. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, hence, we expect the support to hold.

On the other hand, if the XRP/USD pair rises from the current levels, it can move up to $0.40, above which a rally to $0.45 is probable. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls are at a marginal advantage. We like the way the pair has held above the descending channel after breaking out of it. However, the failure to attract buyers even when the sentiment is improving across the sector is a negative sign. Currently, we remain neutral on the digital currency.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) is in a strong uptrend. The correction from close to $98 did not even reach the 20-day EMA, which shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips. With the current three-day correction, the RSI has alleviated its deeply overbought readings. Both the moving averages continue to slope up. All these confirm that the bulls are in the driver’s seat. On a breakout and close above $100, the digital currency can rally to $159 and above it to $180.

On the downside, the LTC/USD pair can correct to the 20-day EMA. The resistance line of the ascending channel is also located at this level. Hence, we expect a strong bounce off this support. We shall try to re-enter the long positions again if we spot a favorable buy setup. However, if the pair slumps below the 20-day EMA, it will lose momentum and can fall to the 50-day SMA.

BCH/USD

Following the sharp up-move on April 2 and 3, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been consolidating in a range of $272.41 to $332.58. The price turned down from the top of the range on April 8 and can now decline to the bottom of the range at $272.41. If this support breaks, a fall to $239 is probable. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $265.

As both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has corrected from its deeply overbought level, the trend favors the bulls. If the BCH/USD pair breaks out of $332.58, it can resume the uptrend. On a breakout above $363.30, it can move up to $468.73, with a minor resistance at $400.

EOS/USD

After rising gradually for the past few days, EOS made a decisive move today. It is now on target to reach the overhead resistance of $6.8299. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the trend is up. However, as the RSI has entered into overbought territory, we suggest traders trail the remaining long positions with a close stop loss.

The zone between $6 and $6.8299 is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the EOS/USD pair turns down from this resistance zone, it might remain range bound between $4.4930 and $6.8299 for a few more days. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls succeed in pushing the price above $6.8299, a rally to $9 is possible.

BNB/USD

We had proposed trailing the stop loss on the remaining long positions below the 20-day EMA in our previous analysis. As Binance Coin (BNB) dipped below the 20-day EMA on April 9, it triggered our suggested stop loss.

The BNB/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. If successful, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $22 and retest the lifetime highs.

However, the negative divergence on the RSI is a warning sign. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. The trend remains bullish. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending long positions once again.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has dipped back close to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer strong support. If the price rebounds from the current levels, it is likely to reach the overhead resistance at $0.14861760. This level will act as a major roadblock, but if the bulls push the price above this level, we can expect the downtrend to be over.

Both the moving averages are gradually sloping up, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand. But if the XLM/USD pair fails to bounce off the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $0.1130 on the remaining long position.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) is trying to rebound from the breakout level of $0.082952. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are keen to defend the first support level. If the cryptocurrency can rise above $0.094256 levels once again, the probability of a rally to $0.112598, followed by a move to $0.20 increase. The uptrending moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought level suggests that the bulls are in command.

However, if the bulls fail to scale above $0.094256, the ADA/USD pair might consolidate for a few days between $0.082952 and $0.094256. It will lose momentum if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA. Therefore, traders can protect the remaining long positions with a stop of $0.080.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on April 9 and followed it up with another small range day today. This shows consolidation following the breakout of the range at $0.02815521.

The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the path of least resistance in the short term is to the upside. The TRX/USD pair should now try to move up to the first target objective of $0.040 and above it to $0.0480. The traders can keep a stop loss of $0.0240 on the long positions.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the support of $0.02815521. If the price re-enters the range, it will indicate that the current breakout was a bull trap.

Crypto investment firms in China have turned to lending for a steady revenue stream to get through the bear market, including Bixin Capital, FBG Capital and Dong Zhao’s DGroup.

Each of these firms currently holds about $15 million worth of outstanding loans originated over the last five months.

Although most of these lenders don’t directly deal with Chinese yuan, they see borrowing demand domestically from retail investors, trading desks and cryptocurrency miners.

Several cryptocurrency investment firms and funds in China have turned to lending for a steady revenue stream to get through the bear market.

These new crypto lenders include such notable names as Bixin Capital, FBG Capital and DGroup, founded by Dong Zhao, who made a name by operating one of the longest-running over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in China. Along with a startup called Babelbank, these investors have originated a combined $60 million worth of loans over the last five months, denominated in cryptocurrencies or, in one firm’s case, Chinese yuan.

The demand, they say, comes mostly domestically, from retail investors, hedge fund traders, and perhaps most unexpectedly, cryptocurrency miners.

“The demand for personal crypto loans doesn’t fluctuate that much regardless of market conditions,” said Xi Wang, head of financial markets at Bixin Capital. “So, in a bearish market, making profits from lending assets is relatively a much [more] stable bet.”

Bixin Capital launched its crypto lending business in November 2018 since activities on the investment side had slowed down, letting customers borrow bitcoin (BTC), ether, EOS, litecoin and tether (USDT) from its own reserve.

For the loans, the firm requires borrowers to put up one of the five supported assets as collateral, and charges an annualized interest rate of about seven percent.

Currently, it has an outstanding loan volume of around $10 million worth of the U.S dollar-pegged USDT, on which it is earning steady interest of “several BTC” per month, Wang said.

Similarly, Vincent Zhou, founder of FBG Capital, also said while his firm has long been involved in crypto loans, it didn’t formally launch a lending unit mid-2018, and now has about $15 million worth of cryptocurrencies as loan receivables.

Bixin, which started as a wallet and mining pool service in 2014, established Bixin Capital in 2017 to invest in cryptocurrency projects entirely with its own capital, without limited partners.

As such, lending is a different kind of investment than Bixin is used to, Wang acknowledged, telling CoinDesk:

“In a way, you can say it’s like a role shift, from investment banking and private equity to commercial banking.”

However, in one respect, this is much unlike bank lending.

Collateral, collateral, collateral

What makes crypto lending different from conventional bank loans is that the only risk control is strict enforcement of collateral requirements and forced liquidation, both Zhou and Wang said.

Wang added:

“It’s a must. Conventional bank loans are based on your education, credit scores, jobs, properties, etc. We don’t evaluate any of these. That’s why our risk control must be completely on collateral.”

For instance, he explained, for Bixin, depending on what crypto serves as collateral, the collateral rate could range between 70 to 75 percent. So if a customer can put up $100 worth of BTC as collateral, they can borrow about $70 worth in USDT.

In the case above, if the price of the BTC decreases to around $78, causing the collateral rate to go above the threshold of 95 percent, borrowers must either put in additional BTC to lower the rate, or Bixin will force-liquidate the held bitcoin at the current price.

Both Wang and Zhou said while their firms essentially play the role of a crypto bank, they are staying away from dealing with Chinese yuan.

Zhou told CoinDesk:

“There are lots of issues with lending Chinese yuan. One is that when we collect debts in fiat currency, it’s difficult for us to ensure that money is clean.”

Wang echoed that sentiment, adding that when Chinese yuan is involved in this context, it could lead to inquiries from law enforcement and could result in bank accounts being suspended.

But this vacuum presented an opportunity for Dong Zhao’s DGroup, which is operating its own crypto lending platform called RenRenbit.

Rather than acting as a lender itself, the firm serves as a consumer-to-consumer advertising platform to allow customers to borrow either Chinese yuan or crypto assets from third-party investors on the platform, with other types of assets held by RenRenbit as collateral.

Wei Wang, chief technology officer at RenRenbit, said in an interview that four months after the platform went live in November, it has facilitated $15 million to $20 million of loans, 60 percent of which are currently outstanding. And notably, that loan volume came from the pockets of just around 200 investors on its platform.

He added that prospective borrowers have the option to set a limit of the annualized interest that they will be charged, usually from 8 percent to 12 percent, and investors decide whether they want to lend the money.

Similarly, RenRenbit enforces a collateral rate that ranges from 65 percent to 85 percent, depending on what assets are pledged as collateral. The rate can be higher if the collateral is a more stable asset such as USDT, than say, bitcoin, Wang added.

And the company makes money by charging a 20 percent commission out of the profits or interest investors collect on each loan, he said. It has also rolled out automatic crypto investment plans to attract more newbies, through which investors deposit Chinese yuan regularly to the platform, which is then converted to various crypto assets based on different portfolio strategies.

Who’s borrowing?

Stepping back, cryptocurrency lending appears to be gaining traction outside China as well.

For instance, Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency fund backed by billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, is aiming to raise a fund of $250 million for lending.

BlockFi, a crypto lender backed by Galaxy Digital, also claimed it gathered $25 million of bitcoin and ether deposits from investors in two weeks, promising an annualized six percent interest. It’s lending out those assets and charges institutional borrowers annual interest of 4.5 percent.

It’s easy to see why lending – along with staking of cryptocurrencies such as Tezos – is appealing right now, since these activities generate a return at a time when crypto prices have been in a slump (this week’s rally notwithstanding). But who is borrowing these assets, and why?

Bixin’s Wang said while the firm doesn’t require borrowers to disclose how they intend to use the loans (since its risk control solely relies on collateral), a significant portion of the demand comes from cryptocurrency miners in China who’d rather borrow USDT and liquidate that into Chinese yuan via OTC desks to pay for their electricity bills.

He explained:

“In a bearish market, miners are reluctant to liquidate their mining results when the price of bitcoin is at the lower end. When you’ve seen bitcoin was once traded at $20,000, you’d feel that’s a huge opportunity cost.”

Indeed, Beijing-based Babelbank, which started off as a crypto bank startup last September, said over 90 percent of its current $27 million outstanding loans are made to cryptocurrency miners in China, who are gearing up their capacity ahead of the water-abundant summer in the country.

Del Wang, co-founder of BabelBank, which raised $2 million in seed and angel rounds from ZhenFund, Lightspeed Partners and NEO Capital, told CoinDesk:

“As long as the ratio of electricity costs over mining results is lower than our collateral rate, a miner may never need to sell any bitcoin to pay utility bills – they borrow. And when a loan’s term matures, they just borrow another loan (to pay for previous loans).”

For miner borrowers, that’s simply a bet, hoping that bitcoin’s price will be higher in the coming months, reaching a point at which they are willing to sell.

The price for having that optionality of not paying mining costs out of their own pockets is they need to pay an annualized 8 percent to 12 percent in interest.

And aside from crypto miners, Bixin’s Wang said OTC and hedge fund traders in China are also strong forces in borrowing bitcoin, with USDT as collateral, so that they can build up basic trading positions without owning a more volatile asset.

“More interestingly, some are even borrowing USDT with bitcoin as collateral and then invest in China’s stock markets,” Wang said.

The SSE Composite Index, which is a market index of all stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, has notably increased by nearly 30% this year.

This may present a dilemma of sorts for investors. Referring to the rally in yuan-denominated stocks, known in China as A-shares, Wang concluded:

“They certainly didn’t want to miss out on the opportunities in A-shares. But then, what if bitcoin can even outperform the stock markets?”

It’s not a stampede, but a growing number of traditional stock exchanges have begun to offer cryptocurrency-related products, in a move that’s been viewed in some quarters as key to introducing cryptocurrency to conventional equities investors. But will the involvement of stock exchanges help the cause of cryptocurrency, or is this merely an opportunistic endeavour by profit-oriented bourses fearful of missing out on crypto revenue?

Breaking New Ground

On April 3, the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) announced that it will start a limited pilot to trade bitcoin and ethereum within the next few weeks. The move by the JSE is the latest in a series of announcements that aim to open the doors to cryptocurrency investment. In the U.S., the Nasdaq has recently listed BTC and ETH indices, while Switzerland’s main stock exchange, SIX, listed an XRP-based exchange-traded product.

According to Marlene Street Forrest, managing director of the JSE, the exchange’s project, implemented in partnership with Canadian financial technology company Blockstation, is aimed at creating a “safe, efficient and transparent regulatory framework” for the trading of digital assets. But it is also clear that the potential for profit might have played a part. “[BTC and ETH trading] is an unprecedented opportunity for the JSE to diversify its product offerings and attract new listings and inbound investments,” said Street Forrest.

Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at Etoro, the global multi-asset investment platform, told news.Bitcoin.com that the integration of cryptocurrency by traditional stock exchanges is mainly motivated by FOMO – the fear of missing out.

“Institutions have realised that crypto is here to stay and have been looking for ways to seize the opportunities presented by crypto assets,” Greenspan opined. “The Jamaica Stock Exchange news is yet another sign that adoption happens gradually in front of your eyes, until you pause for a bit, look around, and realize that crypto is front and centre of the investment landscape,” he added.

Win-Win Situation

Unlike banks, which are experts at lobbying against the competition, traditional stock exchanges aren’t worried about cryptocurrency startups moving in on their turf. On the contrary, quite a number of them appear to have interpreted this as a potential win-win situation. For example, the Nasdaq stock exchange, the world’s second largest stock market by capitalization, started offering real-time information on two new indices tied to the cryptocurrency market – bitcoin core and ethereum – on Feb 25.

The Nasdaq’s move has been seen as key to introducing cryptocurrency to conventional stock market investors on Wall Street and elsewhere, while simultaneously driving mainstream adoption. The stock exchange has swam against the tide in being drawn to crypto assets, starting with publishing analytical reports on bitcoin and partnering with Vaneck to launch BTC futures trading in a falling market in 2018.

Whereas most investors still favor equities over virtual currencies, the arrival of stock exchanges – with their many years of experience – to the crypto markets will in future change all this says Marvin H. Coleby, a securities lawyer and CEO of Raise, a Bahamas-registered digital securities platform. “People trust them [stock markets], institutions trust them and governments have developed safe regulatory frameworks for them to operate,” Coleby told news.Bitcoin.com.

He continued: “They are by far one of the most important examples of human efforts to distribute economic wealth via fractional financial instruments to anyone around the world. Their buy in of distributed ledger-based assets is not only a huge stamp of approval for crypto and other similar digital assets, but it means that those stock markets will make it easier for people to access assets around the world.” Cryptocurrencies and security tokens are digital assets that will significantly extend the impact of fractional financial products that exist both on and off stock market exchanges, he added.

Legitimizing Crypto

Coleby admits the proliferation of opportunistic tendencies exhibited by many entities within the crypto space, but dismisses stock markets as ranking among them. He stated: “Exchanges and stock markets are some of the best placed institutions to understand fractional and divisible financial products that are characteristics of many cryptocurrencies. This seems like a genuine attempt to enter and legitimize the market.”

The Caribbean is perhaps one of the most innovative regions in regard to cryptocurrency, pushing out regulation that is friendly to the development and growth of the technology. The Jamaica Stock Exchange became one of the earliest stock markets to announce any interaction with crypto, long before 2019. Moreover, the rest of the Caribbean is working to develop new regulatory frameworks and technologies, such as in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Jamaica and Barbados.

“I hope that centralized stock markets like the JSE take more seriously how the world will be moving away from centralized exchanges, and the impact that smart contracts will have on the traditional roles of custody and settlement served by centralized exchanges,” cautioned Coleby, the Raise CEO.

Pewdiepie Partners With Live Streaming Platform Dlive

Pewdiepie, the leading Youtube star with over 93 million subscribers, has announced that he is partnering with Dlive. An alternative to video live streaming platform Twitch, Dlive is defined as a “decentralized livestreaming community built using the Lino blockchain.”

Dlive claims to have over 3 million monthly active users and 35,000 active streamers. The platform is available online at Dlive.tv as well as via its Android and iOS apps. Content creators and viewers can earn rewards for their participation in the form of Lino points, the native tokens of the network. For users outside the U.S. it is also possible to buy Lino points with cryptocurrency including bitcoin cash (BCH) as well as BTC, ETH and LTC.

Why Is Pewdiepie Going With Dlive?

Pewdiepie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, has often complained about the demonetization of his videos by Youtube for a long while now, whether due to controversy, copyright claims or other issues. In contrast to Youtube and Twitch, he calls Dlive a platform that is focused on its content creators first. And according to its website, Dlive “takes absolutely zero platform cuts from users’ donations and subscriptions.”

The sovereign microstate known as Liberland has recently minted a new token called merit (LLM) and the coin has been added to the Altilly exchange. Merit is a token built on top of the Bitcoin Cash chain and was issued using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) on March 11. Since the Altilly listing, the token has gathered a market valuation of $1.1 and each LLM is swapping for more than $1 at press time.

Liberland’s Mints Merit Tokens Using the Simple Ledger Protocol

Last October, Liberland revealed that it planned to issue a new cryptocurrency called merit and originally the micronation was going to use the Ethereum blockchain. However, Liberland has decided to create its merit (LLM) tokens using the Bitcoin Cash network coupled with the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). According to blockchain statistics, Liberland has created 1 million LLMs and started minting on March 11. Each token also has a website URL tethered to the coin’s metadata which leads to Liberland.org. LLMs were created at block 573350, are divisible to nine decimals, and the last mint took place on 573350. More merits can also be issued again at a later date so Liberland can add more coins to the token supply.

“Liberland is pleased to confirm that thanks to the private initiative of Liberland citizens and supporters, people have started to trade Liberland Merits (LLM) on the exchange Altilly,” the official Liberland Twitter account announced on Tuesday.

In the future, Liberland citizens with holdings of LLM can use them for voting and people can use them for state contributions (voluntary taxes) as well. The Free Republic of Liberland’s President, Vit Jedlicka, explained last year that merits would be “more of a share in Liberland than a cryptocurrency.” “LLM has multiple purposes and I think that the concept that we put together is quite smart and again that’s the plan to outcompete the existing nation-states in the design of our internal system,” Jedlicka stated at the time.

The BCH community were pleased to hear the news about Liberland’s new token and especially the fact that the coin was built using SLP. Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Sechet tweeted about the new token on Tuesday afternoon.

“Liberland has tokenized its currency, the merit,” explained Sechet. “They chose to do so as an SLP token on the BCH chain — You earn them by helping the project, or buy them to support them financially.”

Merit Market Cap Commands $1.1M

Jedlicka believes there is an additional value to the merit system crafted on the BCH chain. LLM aims to help bolster the creation of the freest country on this planet that allows its citizens to prosper with libertarian ideals and free market enterprise. “Like all the things that are here on this planet has subjective value, and I think it is of great value that we are bringing to the table and our currency will back this basic idea,” Jedlicka explained in an interview last year.

At press time, merit (LLM) has an overall market capitalization of roughly $1.1 million and each coin is trading for $1.13 per LLM. Merits have four markets on Altilly and are paired with BTC, ETH, USDT, and XQR.

“[Merit being built with SLP] is a big deal,” explained Electron Cash developer Jonald Fyookball on Reddit during the announcement. “SLP is starting to catch on — It’s also great that we are building a network effect around a singular token protocol now on BCH.”

Additionally, BCH supporters were thrilled to hear that the ACD token, which is also built using SLP, was listed on the Coinsuper exchange on April 9. Currently paired against USD, the ACD token is trading for $0.16 per coin at the time of publication. ACD has a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Now that BCH-based tokens are getting more exposure to trading platforms and backing from the micronation Liberland, BCH supporters believe the token ecosystem will continue to accelerate.

Bitcoin's low correlation with the Dow could be shortlived. Investors will find out for sure when the next financial crisis arrives. | Source: Shutterstock

Be careful what you wish for. The crypto community continues to beg big investors to get on board with bitcoin, but there could be some unintended – and alarming – side effects. Most notably, bitcoin could be destined to hitch its wagon to the fate of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

While cryptocurrencies should be a respite from the stock market, their mettle has yet to be tested in the flames of an economic downturn. Plus, as widely cited economist Alex Kruger points out, crypto has thus far only been a retail phenomenon. Once the institutional doors swing open to crypto, the dynamics could shift. In times of trouble, investors just may find that bitcoin and the Dow have more in common than they previously thought – despite the decentralized nature of crypto.

Kruger might have shocked some in the crypto community when he suggested that in time of economic crisis, bitcoin will offer little flight to safety.

“IMO crypto will behave like a highly correlated high-beta asset class. Not where you go to for diversification purposes.”

Bitcoin and the Dow – Kissing Cousins in the Next Recession?

What gives? Bitcoin and the Dow are supposed to be non-correlated assets, not trade in lockstep when investors need diversity the most. Crypto should provide the shade of diversification that bolsters returns and slashes risk. That’s what “asset allocators” are banking on. Bitcoin’s low correlation with the Dow, however, could be shortlived.

""Crypto/blockchain"" is often promoted as an asset class with low correlation with risk assets such a stocks. This makes it attractive to asset allocators for diversification purposes, as diversification can enhance returns and reduce risks (see https://t.co/MKz6c0XhNH) — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) April 9, 2019

Wall Street Wields a Double-Edged Sword

Institutional capital has often been lauded as the panacea to crypto’s woes. A bitcoin ETF, for example, will open the floodgates to pensions, endowments, and family offices. Big investors could be a double-edged sword, however, one that exposes bitcoin’s true identity as another Dow in disguise during the next economic recession.

“However, crypto is a nascent asset class. Not a mature one. Correlations should change as the asset class matures and institutional players slowly enter the space. And correlations RISE during crises.”

With a potential recession looming over the economy, investors could find out sooner than later just how uncorrelated bitcoin is from the Dow.

Vinny Lingham on Bitcoin and Altcoin Decoupling

Another matter that is near and dear to the heart of investors is bitcoin’s correlation within the crypto sphere. Not only might bitcoin eventually be correlated to the Dow, but it is driving the performance of altcoins here and now.

Vinny Lingham, a cryptocurrency pioneer who runs blockchain ID platform Civic and increasingly sounds like a perma-bear, isn’t convinced the crypto winter is over. He suggests it’s only when bitcoin eventually “decouples” from the broader crypto market that a bull market will be sustainable.

Many people believe that the crypto winter is over. Here are some of my unfiltered thoughts on this topic. Charts & technicals aside, I don’t believe this rally is sustainable for one reason: The market has not yet decoupled the various crypto assets from Bitcoin. — Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) April 10, 2019

Lingham is focused on data points such as bitcoin’s dominance, which currently hovers below 51%. He says:

“It’s easy to argue that bitcoin can be worth $10k or $20k, or even $100k. But the problem is that as the price has been rising toward those levels, we’re not seeing bitcoin dominance increase disproportionately.”

In the interim, altcoin prices are rising purely on sentiment and not fundamentals, which he suggests “makes no sense.”

One thing is clear from all of this commentary. For an emerging investment category, bitcoin’s relationship with the Dow and other cryptocurrencies can’t be denied.",2019-04-10 17:35:36+00:00

Today’s drop has led the crypto markets to shed nearly $20 billion from its weekly highs, sending the overall crypto market cap from seven-day highs of $187 billion to its current levels of $170 billion.

Bitcoin Leads Crypto Markets to Drop

The recent drop in the markets was first brought about yesterday after Bitcoin quickly surged to highs of $5,400, at which point the cryptocurrency faced a significant amount of selling pressure that sent it reeling down to its current price levels of roughly $5,050.

Bitcoin’s descent – which sparked today’s market drop – has altered the technical strength of the aggregated crypto markets, which were incurring growing bullish momentum over the past several days and weeks.

Now, analysts believe that Bitcoin could drop as low as $4,200 in the near-future, which would undoubtedly lead major alts to surrender an even larger portion of their recent gains.

The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency trader on Twitter, spoke about the possibility of a further retrace in a recent tweet, explaining that she believes BTC could fall to as low as $4,200 before it finds a significant amount of support.

“$BTC There is the start of the drop I have been saying. RSI channel MUST break. Evaluating the RSI again, I do believe we could go low as $4390 (.5 fib) $4.2 (.618 fib) level. I’d be surprised if we go lower (will re-evaluate when levels reached.) 48 & 39 RSI I’m watching,” she explained.

It is important to note that today’s sell-off has been perpetuated by an increase in trading volume, which has climbed to over $63 billion from its weekly lows of $48 billion.

Most Major Altcoins Drop Nearly 10%

Bitcoin’s drop has led most major cryptocurrencies to spiral downwards today, with many dropping nearly 10%.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 9% at its current price of $165, down from its daily highs of $183. Although today’s drop is negative, it is important to remember that ETH is still up significantly from its monthly lows of $130.

XRP has also dropped today and is trading down nearly 8% at its current price of $0.33. This drop has led XRP back towards its monthly lows of approximately $0.30.

Litecoin has been one of the worst performing altcoins today, as it has dropped over 11% to its current price of $78.90. Today’s plunge has led Litecoin to set a fresh weekly low around its current price levels.

The general crypto markets will be closely tracking Bitcoin’s price action over the next few days, and whether or not BTC is able to hold above $5,000 will likely signal whether the bulls are able to maintain the market’s recent upwards momentum.

The powerful movement was enough to drag the entire crypto market with it, including the likes of Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

The rally, which many believe confirm that the bear market bottom is now in due to the first ever cryptocurrency painting a higher high on price charts, saw so much trading volume across Bitcoin and Ethereum, that volume reached levels not witnessed since the peak of the last cryptocurrency bull market.

Is The Bull Run Back? Bitcoin and Ethereum Trading Volume Revisit 2017 Levels

Ever since Bitcoin’s parabolic advance was broken at the tail end of 2017, its all-time high of $20,000 has become a distant memory, and bullish sentiment and general interest has all but left the crypto market. As less investors and traders flocked to the crypto space, trading volumes across top crypto projects has diminished significantly.

Trading volumes often drop during period of indecision, but volume can also drop as trends begin to lose their steam. It’s not until a major movement occurs, that volumes begin spiking again, often confirming a trend continuation or reversal, depending on which direction the movement goes.

Throughout the 2018-2019 bear market, volume has continually diminished. It began to ramp up during the fall through $6,000, but quickly dropped back to the low levels.

Following the longest bear market for Bitcoin on record, a major trend change occurred during last week’s rally, that took Bitcoin price from resistance at $4,200 to $5,200 in a matter of an hour. The powerful movement also brought with it a significant surge in trading volume, confirming that the move was genuine and that a trend reversal may be a reality. Certain indicators suggest the reversal to be legitimate, but bears have yet to give up as is evident in the latest pullback.

On April 10, software developer Karol Trzeszczkowski launched a platform called the Last Will, a smart contract program for the inheritance of bitcoin cash (BCH). The Last Will protocol is an Electron Cash plugin that allows users to create and manage BCH endowments.

Last Will: A Noncustodial and Permissionless Bitcoin Cash Inheritance Solution

BCH supporters have been introduced to a new platform called Last Will, an inheritance contract creation protocol and manager. The platform utilizes checkdatasig covenants thanks to the BCH protocol upgrade that took place last November. On Wednesday, Trzeszczkowski announced the project on the forum r/btc and explained that the protocol allows for noncustodial and permissionless inheritance solutions. Last Will is open source and developers can review the codebase that’s hosted on Github. The contract solution is created using the BCH chain and implements a dead man’s switch with a six-month trigger. If the user doesn’t refresh the Last Will agreement in that timeframe then the BCH becomes available to the inheritor.

“Last Will smart contract uses the first working implementation of looping transactions for refreshing the contract,” Trzeszczkowski’s Last Will specification document reveals.

The contract uses Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) and is defined by using a special address that is cryptographically determined by the contract itself. Essentially, once the requirements have been met, the endowment is made available to the inheritor. In order to use the Last Will service, you need to download and verify the software from the release section on Github. After that, open the Electron Cash version 4.0 or higher and navigate to the Tools tab and select Installed Plugins. After the plugin is added, you will see the Last Will section in the wallet which allows you to create a new contract, check an existing contract, and load the last agreement’s information.

When you want to create a new contract, simply enter the inheritor’s address, the cold wallet address, and then the value of the amount being left. The creator of this software has added an optional email notification service that can be ordered through the plugin for a small fee.

“Six months is quite a long period of time, it’s possible to forget about refreshing your contract,” Trzeszczkowski’s Github repo explains. “To solve this problem Licho offers the notification service … Licho will send you an e-mail reminder a week before your contract expiry date.”

The inheritor doesn’t have to know about the contract unless they verify it and when the original owner passes away Licho will let the successor know the BCH is waiting to be claimed. The service uses a BCH transaction and when the service sends the next-in-line an email it will also have attached Op_Return data. “For the inheritor notification, an encrypted e-mail and the contract address will be attached,” Trzeszczkowski notes.

Covenants and the BCH Programming Language Spedn

The developer also thanked BCH programmer Mark Lundeberg for helping him solve a lot of problems and Tendo Pein for helping with the BCH programming language Spedn and his creation of looping transactions. Spedn is a BCH-based language created by Tendo Pein that is designed for explicitness and safety, with a syntax similar to the C programming environment. Openbazaar and BCHD developer Chris Pacia liked the idea and appreciated how the Spedn language makes checkdatasig covenants a bit easier.

“So this is pretty cool — Bitcoin Cash can do covenants now but the scripts are really too complex to build manually,” Pacia tweeted on Thursday. “However, using the Spedn language it’s pretty easy to make a covenant.”

Bitcoin inheritance is an important aspect of wealth management, just like any other form of money. Last year, U.S. investor Matthew Mellon reportedly passed away with $500 million in cryptocurrencies but his heirs could not obtain the funds. The 54-year old Mellon died with his funds held in cold storage in bank security deposit boxes under phony names. News.Bitcoin.com has written extensively on the subject of Bitcoin and death and how people can prepare their families for digital inheritance. Death is certain but can be unexpected, so the Last Will plugin for the EC wallet gives crypto users another avenue to take in order to ensure their loved ones get their BCH after they pass away.

CoinDesk Korea reported the news on Thursday, saying that the loss was mainly due to a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency market last year, though the company’s operator BTCKorea also cited infrastructure investments and labor costs as factors.

The figure marks a big swing into the red for Bithumb, having recorded a net profit of 534.9 billion won ($469 million) in 2017.

The exchange’s revenues, on the other hand, grew around 17.5 percent to 391.7 billion won ($343.4 million) in 2018, compared to 333.4 billion won ($292.3 million) the year prior.

The figures also show that the exchange’s operating profit declined 3.4 percent to 256.1 billion won ($224.5 million) last year from 265.1 billion won ($232.5 million) in 2017.

Meanwhile, operating expenses rose from 68.3 billion won ($59.8 million) to 135.6 billion won ($119 million), while non-operating expenses increased sharply from 4.1 billion ($3.6 million) won to 381.9 billion won ($334.8 million).

Bithumb has been going through some tough times. Just two weeks ago, the exchange suffered its latest hack, losing around $13 million in the EOS cryptocurrency and about $6.2 million in XRP. Last year, Bithumb was also hacked for some $30 million-worth of cryptocurrencies, but later claimed to have retrieved $14 million-worth of the hacked funds.

Since the latest theft, Bithumb has disclosed that it holds all customers’s assets in cold (offline) wallets to prevent losses through such attacks.

Amid its financial issues, Bithumb, said last month that it plans to cut its staffing levels by up to 50 percent, from 310 employees to around 150.

New York-based payments startup Flexa just raised that amount in a private token sale involving Pantera Capital, 1kx, Nima Capital, Access Ventures and others.

The startup’s token, Flexacoin, is an ethereum-based ERC-20 token that will eventually be used by developers and businesses to stake value on Flexa’s network for merchant payment processing.

While Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding declined to specify which merchants will accept bitcoin through this app, video tests show users buying Starbucks with it. (A Starbucks spokesperson told CoinDesk it is not working with Flexa.)

Spalding emphasized that Flexa is a business-to-business startup. Shoppers won’t need to hold or interact with Flexacoins at all. Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter said the details related to such governance and participation are still under development.

“The long-term goal is to give over the network to the merchants,” Filter added. “A sort of consortium of their own that allows them to accept crypto.”

Return of the token sale

Stepping back, Flexa is one of several companies to fundraise over the past six months through a private token sale without equity options. The predictions market startup Numerai announced a similar raise in March.

Access Ventures partner TJ Abood told CoinDesk his firm would have been interested in an equity offering as well. But as he’s also satisfied with Flexacoin because it allows his firm to participate in growing the network.

Businesses, from Access Ventures to merchants, can stake Flexacoin to the network and earn token rewards in a model comparable to proof-of-stake systems like Cosmos or Tezos. Flexa plans to launch a custodial crypto wallet app for its network, with users being able to spend crypto at point-of-sale with a type of QR code scan, similar to Apple Pay.

“We wanted the total Flexacoin supply to represent how much money can flow through the system right now,” Spalding told CoinDesk, adding that the network will launch on May 13. “All the participants earn money.”

Unlike Numerai’s token-fueled platform, Flexa’s network is not blockchain-based. Flexa’s approach to ethereum-compatibility, without complete reliance on that network, fit into Abood’s investment strategy.

“We subscribe to the idea of being a user-owner. Any company that we invest in, we immediately look to be a user,” Abood said. “Making use of the developer tools and all the system tools that exist to be able to deliver a superior product, that’s what drives us.”

On the other hand, 1kx cofounder Lasse Clausen told CoinDesk his firm also plans to become a staker because he believes for-profit tokenized networks are inherently better than traditional businesses. Speaking to Flexa’s symbiotic merchant acquisition strategy, Clausen added:

“If Flexa were a traditional for-profit venture, how would merchants be able to trust them that they won’t end up raising fees once they have reached enough network effects?”

Bridges not blocks

Instead of building a blockchain-based network, Spalding described Flexa’s protocol as an “elegant pipe” that processes payments from various cryptocurrency networks, including bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, to the merchant’s own payment processing system for direct bank transfers.

“We wanted to build essentially the Stripe for these type of transactions,” Filter said.

Abood said this merchant-oriented structure could entice mainstream brands that are crypto-curious by offering the ability to accept bitcoin without risk. According to Spalding, Flexa will partner with exchange platforms for liquidity on the back-end. Plus, the Flexacoin collateral could be used to compensate if there’s an issue with blockchain settlement.

“Flexa plays a critical role in blockchain adoption at-large because it is bridging this digital payments landscape into a brick-and-mortar setting,” Abood said. “It’s opening up the idea of spending cryptocurrency to a much broader audience.”

Filter described the Flexa protocol as bolting merchant’s traditional infrastructure to a crypto-friendly bridge, rather than relying on debit cards or credit cards. Since the process uses crypto wallets, there’s no personal information exposed the way a credit card payment would.

“I don’t think that blockchains are good for many things,” Spalding added. “But, they are amazingly powerful for fraud-free payments.”

In the future, Flexa plans to add support for various exchange-issued stablecoins and other crypto assets. Until then, the focus is on partnering with exchanges and merchants to make custom on-and-off ramps via the Flexa protocol.

“A driving source in [mainstream] adoption will be the availability to accept cryptocurrency and that’s a merchant decision,” Abood concluded.

This will allow users of Coinbase to transact with holdings of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

The product will initially only be available to customers in the United Kingdom, but they will be able to use the card to buy goods anywhere in the world.

The payments can be made through contactless payments, as well as with the chip and pin method. Users can also withdraw cash from ATMs, directly from their cryptocurrency holdings.

A big milestone for cryptocurrency

While crypto has long been considered a way to avoid the mainstream banking system, this move from Coinbase is expected to see a spike in the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The card has an issuance cost of £4.95, which is waived for the first 1000 users to apply.

As it is a Visa card, it will be accepted anywhere the payment system is accepted in the world.

Upon using the card, Coinbase instantly converts the user’s cryptocurrency holdings into GBP, or the corresponding fiat currency of the area.

The holdings are directly converted into fiat, as long as they are contained within the user’s Coinbase account. The merchant receiving the payment also receives the payment in fiat.

This means that becomes easier for those with a majority of their net worth in crypto to spend more money. Anyone who wishes to use cryptocurrencies in their every day life will also benefit, as it will increase the ease of access of such transactions.

Helping users track their spends

Coinbase has also released the Coinbase Card application, which allows users to keep track of what wallets they are using with the Coinbase Card.

The app will offer summaries of transactions made using the card, the types of purchases which have been made and instant receipts upon payment.

Coinbase says the card has a multitude of features to prevent unauthorised parties from gaining access.

Along with a 2-step verification process, users can also freeze the card instantly if they detect any suspicious transactions.

A new approach to using cryptocurrencies

Naysayers of the technology have always maintained that it was difficult or even impossible to use cryptocurrencies as a global payments system, but this card means it is now truly usable anywhere.

Coinbase also mentioned that it plans to offer this card in other European countries, expanding the base of individuals who can use cryptocurrencies for every day payments.

While creating use cases for the project’s token has been a relatively straightforward exercise, getting it into the hands of its intended audience – pro players and the millions of fans who watch their live-streamed antics – has hitherto been hard. Now, thanks to the emergence of in-browser crypto wallets, young, mobile-oriented audiences can receive and award tokens such as Dream Team’s seamlessly while streaming their favorite esports events. Opera’s crypto-friendly Android browser has been pivotal in driving this trend, with Brave hot on its heels.

New Features, New Users, More Options

Until Opera came along, spending cryptocurrency in-browser was largely constrained to desktop devices, with Metamask handling ETH and ERC20 tokens and Badger taking care of all things BCH. With the introduction of Opera’s integrated ETH wallet, however, it’s now simple for users to browse, buy, send and receive crypto all within their web browser. On March 20, Opera went one step further, introducing an in-browser VPN for mobile users that can be activated in two clicks. At the same time, its new Android update introduced crypto pairing, enabling mobile users to link their Opera cryptocurrency wallet with their desktop browser, explaining:

With the recent improvements to our Crypto Wallet, including our efforts to dramatically simplify the acquisition of funds, we are fulfilling our goal to make Opera for Android the natural choice for stepping into blockchain technology and Web 3.0 for the first time.

The Marriage of Smartphone Hardware and Software

The greatest progress that has been made in mainstreaming cryptocurrency through mobile has arguably come courtesy of HTC and Samsung, working in conjunction with companies such as Opera. The former’s Exodus smartphone includes a hardware wallet that integrates with the Opera browser. Users benefit from having their funds securely stored on the phone’s Zion wallet, while still being able to spend their crypto within the Opera browser, which also grants access to a plethora of dapps through the Opera Dapp Store.

This week, a software update to the Exodus phone added Zion wallet support for stellar. The wallet already supports bitcoin core, litecoin, and ethereum. In addition, Zion now enables crypto to be purchased directly via credit card in conjunction with Simplex. There’s a 5% fee and $10 minimum fee, but it’s another small step towards making it easier to purchase crypto assets and spend them directly within the Opera browser. In the last three weeks, Brave has also rolled out Brave Rewards Beta on Android, enabling users to reward content creators using the native BAT token.

There’s still work to be done in improving the UX and the range of cryptocurrencies these browsers support. Nevertheless, significant strides have been made in making it easier to spend and send cryptocurrency on mobile. Out of nowhere, the humble mobile browser has risen to become one of the most valuable drivers of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

Solomon made his remarks before the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on April 10, during a hearing entitled “Holding Megabanks Accountable: A Review of Global Systemically Important Banks 10 years after the Financial Crisis.”

As previously reported, Goldman Sachs’ alleged plans to create a crypto-focused unit by the end of June 2018 were originally covered in a December 2017 report from Bloomberg. In September 2018, unnamed sources told Business Insider that the project had been put on hold. Several days later, the firm’s chief financial officer, Martin Chavez, told reporters that the recent reports were “fake news.”

In his remarks, Solomon said that Goldman Sachs has engaged with clients that are involved in clearing physically-settled crypto futures, but that alleged trading desk plans were false:

“The first [Bloomberg article] wasn’t correct. Like others, we are watching and [...] doing work to try to understand the cryptocurrency market as it develops [...] but we never had plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk.”

Notably, the CEO did not rule out such a move from the bank in the future, stating that:

“We might at some point in time, but there’s no question, when you’re dealing with cryptocurrency, it’s a new area [...] it is unclear from a regulatory perspective, it’s unclear whether [...] in the long run, as a currency, those technologies are going to work and be viable.”

Ohio Republican Congressman Warren Davidson, who was questioning Solomon over the media reports, himself voiced his belief that the U.S. is lagging behind other countries and failing to “take advantage of this thriving sector [crypto]” due to regulatory uncertainty.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, other CEOs in attendance at the hearing included JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who affirmed the value of blockchain technology but reiterated his belief that decentralized cryptocurrencies do not have any intrinsic value.

A bipartisan bill to exclude cryptocurrencies from being classified as securities and foster more regulatory clarity for crypto — first proposed by Rep. Davidson and Democratic Congressman Darren Soto in December 2018 — was reintroduced in a revised form to Congress this week.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-china-ban-crypto-mining,"On April 9, Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency is considering the elimination of crypto mining in the country. Given that China has been hosting the majority of mining pools on its soil, the global crypto industry might be poised to take a massive hit. However, the plan is not written in stone at this point, and part of community has dismissed it as casual FUD.

Brief introduction to China’s relationship with crypto

Chinese authorities have been spearheading the “blockchain before Bitcoin” approach since September 2017, when the infamous crackdown on local initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto exchanges occurred. As of now, people in China can hold cryptocurrencies, but they are prohibited from trading them.

The local mining industry specifically has also been subject to repressions. In February 2018, CNN Money reported that the Chinese government pushed crypto miners to make an ""orderly exit"" from the industry due to tax issues and mining being generally dangerous for the environment.

Indeed, according to a separate article published by Quartz a month earlier, the country’s top internet-finance regulator, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, ordered local authorities to use all available options — such as “measures linked to electricity prices, land use, tax, and environmental protection” — to force miners to shut down their business. In addition to that, the agency had allegedly obliged regional authorities to submit regular progress reports, detailing the existing mining facilities in their jurisdictions.

In response to the intensifying crackdown, some of China's largest mining players chose to move shop or even change their main line of business. Thus, Chinese ASIC chip manufacturer and mining outfit Bitmain, once the industry’s most profitable company, which is now experiencing significant difficulties caused by the bear market, decided to turn to artificial intelligence (AI) as an alternate revenue source. “As a China company, we have to be prepared,'' Bitmain’s former co-chief executive, Jihan Wu, explained at the time. The company also planned to run a major mining operation in Rockdale, Texas, but had to suspend the plan due to the market collapse earlier this year.

However, China remains a mining superpower. According to data from Blockchain.com, most of the largest Bitcoin mining pools are controlled by Chinese organizations. An earlier study conducted by the University of Cambridge argued that the Chinese dominance in the mining market was made possible by the cheap electricity and land available in provincial areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan and Sichuan. Reports issued around the same time indicated that over two-thirds of global mining pools were based in China.

New plans: NDRC to dismiss mining as an eco-unfriendly activity

Now, China's central state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has revealed it might curb crypto mining in the country altogether. Notably, the news was first broken by state-owned newspaper the Securities Times, who reported that the NDRC’s draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry, as per Reuters.

Thus, the NDRC has reportedly included crypto mining as part of its draft for a revised list of industrial activities the agency intends to shut down because they “lacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,” among other issues.

The move forms part of the NDRC’s wider Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring, which has been issued since 2005 and determines which industries are to be encouraged, restricted or eliminated in the country.

The agency has reportedly not set a proposed deadline for eliminating crypto mining industry, postulating instead that it should be dwindled with immediate effect. The public now has until May 7 to comment on the draft.

As local newspaper South China Morning Post reported, the new plan brings uncertainty not only to local miners, but to the makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs as well. That would include the aforementioned Bitmain, which, in 2017, controlled an estimated three-quarters of the global market, as well as Canaan Creative, another large Chinese mining hardware manufacturer. Both companies had filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, but were met with skepticism by the local watchdog.

Additionally, according to its IPO filing, by mid-2018, Bitmain operated as many as 11 mining farms in China, and hence would be largely affected by the NDRC’s reported plans. The company has declined to comment on the issue, as per various media reports.

Community reaction

Historically, big news from China tends to affect the crypto market. For instance, when local regulators introduced yet another restraint on cryptocurrencies in January last year, Bitcoin swiftly dropped to its lowest level in more than a month, with Ethereum (ETH) declining 19% and Ripple (XRP) collapsing 29%.

Similarly, the new ban, if implemented, is likely to have a strong impact on the global crypto industry, argue some crypto mining consultants, such as Mark D’Aria of Bitpro Consulting LLC. “Short term, it could be extremely disruptive,” he told Cointelegraph. He went on to say:

“There will certainly be many winners and losers in the mining industry, as non-Chinese miners would benefit in the short term from significantly reduced difficulty, and from inexpensive surplus hardware as it filters out of China.”

However, the ultimate effect largely depends on how, if and when the ban is implemented, D’Aria argues, which is unclear at this time:

“If it was decreed that all miners were to shut down immediately, all of that hashrate lost in an instant could significantly disrupt the technical operation of the Bitcoin blockchain, slowing it down significantly until the next difficulty reduction. If this ban was implemented shortly after the last difficulty adjustment, this transitional period could last months.”

In the worst-case scenario, D’Aria explains, it could take months for the network to bounce back — but either way, the Bitcoin blockchain should be safe in the long run.

“It's yet another example of how resilient Bitcoin actually is — it can be disrupted in the short term, but long term it adjusts to compensate.”

He elaborated:

“Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. This takes approximately every two weeks at a stable hashrate. If 80% of the hashrate were to go offline 16 blocks after the adjustment, the next 2000 blocks would take 5x as long to mine (assuming the hardware wasn't rapidly redeployed outside of China.) This two week period would stretch out to over two months. During these two months transaction rate would also be slowed down by 80%, confirmations that used to take minutes will take hours and fees will likely rise dramatically due to competition for block space. At a time when Bitcoin is still widely criticized for being slow and expensive to use, it's hardly going to do Bitcoin any favors. [...] But if China allows miners to wind down over a few weeks, difficulty adjustment will gracefully handle the loss in hash rate, and there would be little noticeable change to the functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain.”

If the ban does come through, however, part of the mining economy could move underground, but the overall scope of mining operations won’t be the same for China, which might be dethroned by other countries in that case, D’Aria said:

“It [cryptocurrency mining in China] can continue at a very small scale — a basement here, a shed there, etc. However, it is not plausible that large mining farms would be using megawatts of electricity without the authorities noticing. Even if a few chinese miners try to carry on at a small scale, on a global level it would be insignificant. The US, Canada, Scandinavia and a few Eastern European nations would then comprise the lion's share of mining power — and in all likelihood the mining hardware would eventually filter outside of China to those who can still use it.”

“China FUD”?

Other parts of the crypto community don’t see any reason to panic whatsoever. For instance, Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, pointed out that the NDRC’s purview in regard to the industries it wants to eliminate seems limited:

there is another version of such proposal published in 2011 https://t.co/BY2unufFbd



Obviously many stuff should be “eliminated” in the 2011 version reappear in the 2019 version 🙃🙃🙃 such proposal in China usually is just “proposal” — Dovey Wan 🦖 (@DoveyWan) April 9, 2019

A similar viewpoint was expressed by an independent crypto industry analyst Katherine Wu, who told Wired that this clampdown seems to be more indirect compared to previous crypto regulations in the country, and many industries on the commission’s list of wasteful activities are still far from what’s described under “immediate elimination.”

“It is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand, but it is not a ban,” Zhao Qianjie, a former employee at BTCChina exchange, told The New York Times, arguing that the government might not impose strict sanctions for local miners.

Emin Gün Sirer, creator of the world’s first cryptocurrency to deploy a proof-of-work (PoW) concept and professor at Cornell University, argued that the news “doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin” in a series of tweets.

“It just means that most of the hashpower will move across a border, some will go ‘underground’ in China, tucked into backrooms of old factories. Cost of coin production might go up, but that doesn't affect coin price at all.”

Sirer then categorized the media reports as “China FUD.” “Though as far as consumer-affecting FUD goes, this is pretty weak,” he tweeted. “The impact is on miners, not regular users.”

Instead, Sirer referenced the reports to talk about the status of proof-of-stake (PoS) in the global crypto market, which, in his opinion, has far more advantages compared to PoW.

“It's high time some adult looked at what was happening with PoW mining, namely, racks of machines performing useless calculations whose sole purpose is to hold back other racks of machines, and said ‘this is a waste of electricity.’ [...] The coming year will be the year of Proof of Stake systems. They are green, sustainable and quiescent. They do not leak any value from the store of value to the power company. There's no dependency on a state energy commission for their security.”

Notably, last week, in the United States, Montana’s county of Missoula adopted new regulations for cryptocurrency mining, requiring miners to use only renewable energy.

Nevertheless, while PoS is indeed generally considered to be much more power-efficient than PoW, it might have its own shortcomings as well, warns D’Aria:

“Arguably the core difference between PoW and PoS is that PoW is an inextricable link between the blockchain and the ‘real world’, for better or worse. Whereas PoS exists purely as a computational and societal construct, no one has to give up anything extrinsic to the system in order to keep it running, and with nothing to physically anchor it's value to the real world a crisis of confidence in the value of the currency could potentially lead to a death spiral where security becomes so compromised by loss of coin value that it is effectively destroyed. Just because we haven't seen something like that happen to a PoS blockchain yet doesn't mean it can't — there's a first time for everything.”",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/overwhelming-majority-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-investors-refuse-to-report-taxes/,"As the tax deadline draws closer, crypto investors will need to review their losses and gains related to their Bitcoin and altcoin holdings, and determine if they are required to report them on their taxes.

However, according to a recent Twitter poll, the vast majority of crypto investors are refusing to report their taxes, and are willing to risk stiff penalties should the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) discover the unreported earnings.

Crypto Investors Say “No Chance” to Reporting Taxes

This coming Monday is the tax deadline in the United States, a time when procrastinators scramble to the post office in hopes of getting their last minute tax reporting time-stamped before the deadline has passed.

https://twitter.com/CryptoWendyO/status/1116367404789972992

According to a new poll shared on Twitter by crypto-focused Youtube personality Crypto Wendy O, crypto investors are refusing to report their crypto taxes. The poll revealed that 81% of all respondents replied with “not a chance” when asking what the status of their crypto taxes were.

Related Reading | Poll Reveals Majority of Crypto Investors See Bitcoin Price at $100,000 to Millions Long-Term

5% said they “will start next week”, which is the day the deadline is up, while 15% of crypto investors reveal they are “currently doing them.” The poll strangely omits an option for crypto investors who have already completed their tax returns.

Following last year’s bear market, many investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may have more realized losses than gains, however, taxpayers are still required to report any losses on capital asset transactions that they made within the tax year, regardless if it was a gain or not. Failing to properly report taxes can lead to penalties or jail time.

Bitcoin Taxes Don’t Need To Be Difficult, There’s No Excuse Not to Report

Crypto investing is already risky due to it being an emerging market and a technology that isn’t yet fully utilized at scale, but avoiding paying taxes is outright playing with fire. Exchanges are actively working with the IRS to supply customer data, which can and will be used to compare against reported earnings or losses. Those that fail to report properly are at risk of an audit, or worse.

In the last two weeks, cryptocurrency prices have seen significant volatility and during this time onlookers have noticed large bitcoin whale movements once again. Data stemming from blockchain analysis indicates that over the last 48 hours, unknown whale wallets moved over 20,000 BTC ($101 million), showing another large migration not seen since last February. Additionally, bitcoin cash whales have accumulated 1.1 million BCH in the last five weeks.

Also read: Bitcoin Whales Have Accumulated Thousands of Coins in the Last 2 Months

Whales Have Moved $300 Million Worth of BTC Over the Last Week

Bitcoin whale watchers are at it again, monitoring exchange order books and blockchain transactions to uncover clues about the next big market cycle. In February, news.Bitcoin.com reported that large BTC holders captured more than 150,000 BTC ($762 million) since Dec. 17, 2018. Similarly, the top five largest BCH holders managed to gather 138,014 BCH ($39 million) since the same time last year. After a period of accumulation, both cryptocurrencies’ fiat values were much lower than today, with BTC priced at $3,800 and BCH at $135 per coin. On April 12, BTC is priced just above the $5K zone and BCH is averaging $285 per coin across global exchanges. Over the last few days, armchair sleuths noticed a total of 20,378 BTC ($101 million) migrating from unknown wallets to other unknown wallets and exchanges.

Blockchain detectives think that the wallets are not preparing to sell the BTC because 9,939 BTC moved separately to an unknown wallet, while 10,439 BTC did the same to another random wallet. From these movements, onlookers then started noticing an extreme amount of accumulation taking place which saw 42,616 BTC ($215 million) leave various cryptocurrency exchanges in the last 24 hours. Trading platforms that saw large withdrawals include Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Binance, Huobi, Okex, Kraken, Coinbase, and Korbit. The 42,000 BTC movement took place as BTC dropped below the $4,900 range during the early morning trading sessions on April 12.

Central Banking Policies Push Crypto Accumulation Higher

On April 10, BTC prices spiked to a high of $5,345 on Bitstamp and analyst Travis Kling of Ikigai Asset Management and Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, indicated the Federal Reserve was the primer. Cryptos jumped more than 20% almost immediately after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FOMC report which stated the central bank would not change current interest rate policies. Kling, Aslam, and London-based data researcher from Tokenanalyst, Sid Shekhar, have noticed whale wallets accumulating massive amounts of crypto in the last few months and even more so after the Federal Reserve’s decision.

A big indication of this accumulation can also be seen in the BTC and BCH networks’ unspent transaction output (UTXO) set size growth. Both assets’ UTXO size has grown significantly and crossed levels not seen since 2017’s all-time price highs. History shows that when the UTXO set size grows and accumulation takes place at this speed, a bull rally usually follows a few months later.

Bitcoin Cash Whales Wallets Obtain 1.3 Million BCH Since February 25

Our research from February shows that the wealthiest BTC whales holding between 1-100 BTC actually have less coins this April. Back in February, the top 1-10 and 1-100 coin holders held roughly 5,908,501 BTC but since then they have parted ways with 12,914 BTC (-$65 million). The biggest bitcoin cash holders have accumulated a lot of BCH since our report in February. The richest BCH whales have managed to capture 1,330,415 BCH or $377 million at the time of publication. This indicates a lot of BCH whales seem optimistic about the future of the decentralized currency and last week’s 95% price jump showed bitcoin cash markets have seen significant demand.

It’s hard to say what the giant crypto whales are up to when all these coins start moving around, especially in multi-million dollar increments. Many traders believe the bottom is in for most cryptos right now and market actors have initiated an accumulation phase. Other observers are still very skeptical and think that we could see another big drop in the future, even lower than what people are currently calling the bottom. Vinny Lingham, often referred to as the “oracle” for his correct predictions, believes BTC must withstand 24-48 hours above the $6,200 range in order to remain bullish. Whatever the case may be right now, BTC and BCH whales are moving large numbers of coins around and whales always seem to be one step ahead of the public when it comes to preparing for large market spikes and dumps.

The letter, which Chainalysis sent to the FATF, criticizes the organization’s demands to make cryptocurrency exchanges identify and keep records of senders and recipients involved in cryptocurrency transactions.

These demands had surfaced at the end of February, with the FATF subsequently inviting public feedback on its literature.

According to Chainalysis, such requests would place exchanges, which the FATF calls “Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs),” in an almost impossible position.

Should exchanges shut down due to non-compliance, illicit activity would be driven underground to decentralized platforms, making fighting crime harder, not easier, for authorities, Chainalysis argues.

“There is no infrastructure to transmit information between VASPs today, and no one has the ability to change how virtual asset blockchains work,” the letter reads. It continues:

“Forcing onerous investment and friction onto regulated VASPs, who are critical allies to law enforcement, could reduce their prevalence, drive activity to decentralized and peer-to-peer exchanges, and lead to further de-risking by financial institutions. Such measures would decrease the transparency that is currently available to law enforcement.”

The FATF has meanwhile kept up pressure on governments on its list of countries making insufficient progress fighting issues such as money laundering and terrorist financing.

As Cointelegraph reported this month, Pakistan announced that it would implement cryptocurrency regulations in response to criticism that an unregulated landscape facilitates financial crime. Pakistan’s central bank banned cryptocurrency trading in April 2018.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-emphasizes-privacy-by-offering-coin-conversions-without-an-account,"A cryptocurrency exchange says it is prioritizing the privacy of its users — eliminating the “tedious” registration steps imposed by other websites.

BitConvert argues that some rival platforms ask for too many personal details when they are bringing new users on board and says this can make consumers uncomfortable when they are in pursuit of absolute anonymity.

The company also claims such excessive registration procedures actively undermine the purpose of coins that were designed to deliver privacy.

According to BitConvert, its users have the ability to “instantly exchange coins” without being required to register an account with the website. At present, it supports the exchange of Bitcoin and ZCash (ZEC).

ZCash — which, at the time of writing, is the 22nd-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap — describes itself as a “privacy protecting digital currency built on strong science.” The coin’s founders say that its infrastructure ensures personal details remain completely confidential — all without compromising transaction data being posted to a public blockchain. “Selective disclosure features” also enable consumers to share transaction details for audit or compliance purposes.

BitConvert says that it plans to support more cryptocurrencies in the not-too-distant future, all while remaining loyal to its mantra of “anonymous, fast, safe.” Ethereum — along with Monero, another coin that places an emphasis on privacy — are specifically named as two coins that are in the pipeline.

Quick transactions

The privacy-led exchange says that most transactions can be fully completed and confirmed within an hour — and in many cases, execution times can be as little as five to 30 minutes. While two block confirmations are required for Bitcoin, a total of five are needed for ZCash.

BitConvert is available here

BitConvert stresses that its rationale behind eliminating the need for creating a user account is to “fully protect privacy” — and to this end, no personal information is collected when a transaction is taking place, including IP addresses. The company says that it promises these features will not change “so long as our platform is operating,” in an attempt to build trust among users. Data such as the transaction hash, address and amount are kept on record — but this is only to ensure that support can be provided to the consumer in the event there is a complication with a payment.

The company says it hopes to blend anonymity with simplicity. It monitors the best rates for Bitcoin and ZCash on a plethora of other platforms, such as Binance and Bitfinex, to ensure its users get the best deal.

Given how BitConvert users do not have their own account, the platform says it has taken a strong stance on security — making sure that its services are protected using strong security protocols, while also striking partnerships with dependable trading platforms.

Send and go

BitConvert sets out the procedure for using its exchange in three simple steps. Firstly, users select the crypto trading pair they wish to use (at present, it is limited to Bitcoin and ZCash). From here, they set out how much crypto they wish to convert along with their wallet address. Finally, the user can send their funds to BitConvert and complete the exchange. When it comes to the destination for converted coins, the company recommends its clients “only use trusted services in order to avoid losing their funds.”

Privacy has long been a buzzword in the crypto world — and contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin does not necessarily offer its users the anonymity they might expect. Instead, the leading cryptocurrency delivers something known as “pseudonymity,” meaning that consumers only have the opportunity to obfuscate their real identities rather than hide them altogether.

While he didn’t provide a specific reason for departing the firm, Romero said:

“Staying true to a mission often requires doing hard (or even unpopular) things. But I’ve been lucky to learn first-hand that it’s those hard things that often generate the most value.”

“I’m planning to take some time to figure out what’s next,” he continued, adding that he joined Coinbase when it had just 20 staff – it now has a headcount of over 700.

In his time at the firm, Romero has worked on “almost every aspect” of the Coinbase business, he said, including banking partnerships and both consumer and institutional businesses.

Despite Coinbase’s status as one of the most popular and valuable crypto exchanges – it raised $300 million late last year giving it a valuation of $8 billion – there have been a spate of departures (and some arrivals too) in the months since.

Two weeks ago, Coinbase’s director of institutional sales, Christine Sandler, left the exchange for Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest financial services providers. Earlier this year, the exchange’s director of data science and risk Soups Ranjan also left, as did senior compliance manager Vaishali Mehta.

And at least nine other senior or mid-level employees have left Coinbase since its October fundraise.

It was previously revealed that, since March 2018, the firm has been offering a cover up to $5,000 a year for treatments like egg-freezing in a bid to retain staff – that’s in addition to more standard health insurance options.

Coinbase did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on Romero’s departure by press time.

Weiss Crypto Ratings says despite the 2018 bear market, there was a considerable uptick in the usage of altcoins. The rating agency says this trend points to the increasing level of cryptocurrency adoption for many users across the globe.

Cryptocurrency Sees Transactions Soar in 2018

According to a blog post published by the agency on Wednesday (April 10, 2019), four altcoin projects saw massive growth in user adoption throughout 2018. Meanwhile, at the time, market prices were plummeting by an average of 80 percent across the board.

EOS transaction volume grew from 7,000 per day to about 4.6 million per day between February 2018 and March 2019. Tron, also saw its own count increase from 3,000 to 1.9 million during the same period.

The other two cryptocurrency projects identified by Weiss Ratings – BitShares and WAX, saw their numbers grow to 1.1 million and 4.4 million transactions per day, respectively.

In total, these four altcoin projects experienced a 2,700 percent increase in daily transaction count, growing from 433,000 transactions in February 2018 to more than 12.4 million as at March 2019.

According to Weiss Ratings, this increased adoption in the face of bear market conditions parallels the trend observed during the dot-com era. The agency expects that developments in the technology will lead to a greater cryptocurrency adoption in the near future.

Not All Transactions Are Equal

However, it is important to note that high transaction count doesn’t necessarily equate to meaningful value transfer. Moreover, transacting on the aforementioned top-four blockchains, in particular, costs very little. Therefore, it may be a poor metric to gauge mass adoption as most of this activity may not actually be economic in nature and/or performed by real users.

EOS’s daily transaction count, for example, outstrips Bitcoin by as much as 14 times. However, Bitcoin value transferred dwarfs every other existing blockchain.

Earlier this week, cryptocurrency analyst Ceteris Paribus highlighted that Bitcoin processes 20 times more USD transactions than EOS despite having only about seven percent of the latter’s transaction count.

Additionally, Bitcoin’s metrics do not include second-layer transactions via the Lightning Network.

Transaction counts get a lot of hype, but what kind of value is actually being moved on chain? For example:

Bitcoin processes <7% the amount of daily transactions as EOS yet moves 20x the USD. pic.twitter.com/dgGHgE4rKQ — Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) April 10, 2019

Weiss Ratings does acknowledge this fact, saying:

Of course, not all transactions are qualitatively the same. A $10 million Bitcoin transfer is obviously more important than a simple vote or ‘like’ on Steem.

According to Weiss Ratings, other essential metrics like security, network capacity, and developer activity have also increased over the last 12 months. Coupled with the lower prices, the agency believes that altcoins are on their way to gaining greater traction in the finance and technology industries.

As reported by Bitcoinist, an online Twitter poll by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revealed that many people Bitcoin and other cryptos will become mainstream within the next five years.

Lithuania, one of the Baltic tigers that has in past few years demonstrated it doesn’t shy away from new technologies and the digital economy, is preparing to introduce stricter rules for crypto companies. The government in Vilnius is working on amendments that according to officials will go beyond the requirements of the latest, fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

Going Beyond What Brussels Wants

The small European nation, which became one of the Old Continent’s major crowdfunding hotspots, a real token economy hub, is going to implement legal changes that are likely to burden companies in the crypto and fintech sector with more obligations. They are part of the efforts of Lithuanian authorities to step up control over virtual currencies and increase oversight of the economy built around them.

Under the new rules, only entities registered with the country’s Center of Registers will be allowed to operate with digital assets in Lithuania. These companies will have to adopt comprehensive know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering procedures. According to the draft, the measures will have to be implemented upon establishing a relationship with a client for the first time. Service providers will be expected to inform the Financial Crime Investigation Service (FCIS) about larger transfers.

The requirements will cover not only operations involving fiat money but also crypto-to-crypto transactions. Companies that act as intermediaries in these deals will be responsible for ensuring compliance with Lithuania’s Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. That means they will be required to check the identity of their clients before providing any services.

Sigitas Mitkus, director of the Finance Ministry’s Financial Market Policy Department, explained the government’s intentions:

“We want to create a transparent legal environment for virtual currency exchanges, depository wallet operators and ICO initiators. We also want to contribute to ensuring better consumer protection.” Speaking to the BNS news agency, he emphasized that by introducing certain limits for financial operations, Lithuanian authorities are going further beyond the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5).

“We will probably become the first in the world to implement the FATF [Financial Action Task Force] recommendations and apply the requirements not only to the conversion of virtual currency to traditional ones and vice versa, but also when converting one virtual currency into another,” added the Finance Ministry official.

Prepared for Regulatory Challenges

To better understand how the upcoming regulatory developments will influence crypto-related business in the Baltic country, news.Bitcoin.com spoke to Vytautas Karalevičius, founder of the Lithuanian fintech company Bankera which is currently working to establish an online bank and offer crypto-backed loans. He is also the CEO of its subsidiary Spectrocoin, a platform that provides cryptocurrency wallet and exchange services.

Karalevičius admitted that the new regulations will directly affect the cryptocurrency brokerage he is in charge of. The company has been on the market for six years and is considered a success story within the country’s fintech industry. During that time, Spectrocoin has attracted nearly a million customers and created jobs for over 100 professionals.

Despite the need to adapt further, Karalevičius and his colleagues believe their companies are well prepared for the changes. “Since we act as a link between crypto and fiat currencies, KYC and AML procedures have been important for us from day one,” he said. The executive thinks regulation is a necessity in the Lithuanian cryptocurrency sector and he is convinced that a stable regulatory environment is key for the maturity and expansion of his business.

Vytautas Karalevičius, whose company has been advocating for the adoption of proper crypto regulations in Lithuania, hopes for clear licensing and operating rules which, in his view, are essential for the growth of all businesses, including those dealing with cryptocurrency. Regulation can significantly decrease fraudulent schemes and eliminate the presumption that cryptocurrencies are a primary haven for illegal activities, he noted.

According to Karalevičius, the unclear regulatory environment has already caused an outflow of talent and capital from the country, as many Lithuanian teams decided to incorporate their projects in other jurisdictions. He expects the new rules to significantly change the situation in the established crypto sector. “The full impact, of course, will depend on the ability of each industry player to swiftly transit from unregulated activities to full compliance,” he commented.

New Law to Affect Lithuanian Customers

Not only Lithuanian businesses, but also their clients will likely be affected by the new legislation, Spectrocoin’s CEO noted. If the law is fully implemented as drafted, local residents will not be able to benefit from cryptocurrency services provided by companies based outside Lithuania, as it states that only entities registered in Lithuania will be allowed to serve Lithuanian clients.

Estonia, another country in the Baltic region hosting a thriving crypto industry thanks to favorable regulations, recently announced its own plans to tighten the licensing regime for companies working with digital assets. One of the new rules under consideration states that foreign entities licensed in Estonia will have to comply with the requirement to maintain an office there. Spectrocoin has already established an Estonian branch and obtained a license in order to provide services to non-Lithuanian clients. The company is also exploring opportunities to operate from other jurisdictions.

Bankera, Spectrocoin’s mother company, was one of the platforms that benefited significantly from the booming crypto market. It raised $150 million with its initial coin offering, which was one of the most successful token sales. Now its founder believes the days of ICOs are gone and not because of regulation but due to the decreasing wealth in the crypto space caused by the diminished price of digital assets.

Facebook's crypto project and a reported $1 billion funding seek is intriguing bitcoin evangelist Tim Draper. | Image credit: Flickr

Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper is one of the few people who could make Facebook likable again. Turns out Facebook crypto could be added to the impressive list of companies Draper’s backed.

Draper, whose winning bets have included bitcoin and Skype, to name a couple, plans to meet with Mark Zuckerberg’s team to explore Facebook’s plans for a $1 billion fundraising. The funds would reportedly be used to back the social media giant’s own cryptocurrency.

Draper told Bloomberg:

“I am interested to hear the story. We will see if it is a fit.”

Give Facebook Crypto a Chance

Facebook has been an example of what not to do with privacy, a feature that is woven into the knitting of the crypto community. In fact, when crypto exchange Coinbase, of which Draper is invested, announced the controversial Neutrino acquisition, the first thing that sprung to mind was didn’t we learn anything from Facebook?

Zuckerberg must be paying attention or at least has built a blockchain-knowledgeable team around him. He’s taking a different tack with crypto, and the approach appears to be resonating with big backers. In addition to Draper, other venture capitalists, as well as hedge funds and family offices, are reportedly ready to pounce at the opportunity.

https://www.facebook.com/tim.draper/videos/10157346412884235/

Zuck “Likes” Crypto

Zuckerberg’s company is eying the Whatsapp messaging service as the conduit for crypto transfers. Whether the stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar or a basket of other currencies, it is expected to provide stability for remittances, with an early focus on India. It’s early days for Facebook crypto, but adding Draper to the mix could accelerate things. Surely it would put the Facebook team in front of a network of developers who have built some of the most successful blockchain startups around.

Facebook made a step in the direction of redemption when it revealed that it is making a push toward encrypted messaging. It’s part of a broader transformation that extends to online shopping and payments. The idea is to create additional revenue streams to lessen the company’s dependence on ad income, the latter of which birthed the privacy fiasco.

In media interviews, Draper comes across as a friendly guy. Not only that, but he knows a good investment when he sees one. Venture capitalism is in his blood but crypto also seems to run through his veins. So if he is willing to hear Zuckerberg out, so too should the rest of the crypto community.",2019-04-13 08:49:00+00:00,https://nypost.com/2019/04/13/hackers-are-stealing-millions-in-bitcoin-and-living-like-big-shots/,"At 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon in January 2018, Michael Terpin was on his laptop, prepping for a conference in Las Vegas. His iPhone buzzed with an incoming message. Google was notifying him that his email passcode had been changed.

Terpin hadn’t changed it.

Fearing he’d been hacked, the 62-year-old tech entrepreneur checked a second phone, an old Blackberry, to see if it had been compromised. The Blackberry was crippled, ­unable to go online or receive calls.

Within 10 minutes, Terpin contacted AT&T to demand that his Blackberry account be shut down. It was a race against time to stop a group of cyber-bandits. The group’s goal? To steal millions of dollars in virtual cash that Terpin, a pioneer in the field of cryptocurrency, had amassed and stashed online.

Within 30 or so minutes, as Terpin frantically searched through some 50 crypto accounts to confirm they were secure, the thieves struck gold on one that he had yet to check. “An asset worth $23.8 million, accrued over about two years, was taken from me,” Terpin told The Post. “Now it’s gone.”

Terpin was the victim of a cutting-edge scam known as SIM swapping. Tech-smart thieves managed to swap Terpin’s digital identity remotely from the SIM card that controlled his Blackberry to a blank SIM card in one of their phones.

Usually, the scam victimizes those who own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Difficult to tax or trace, crypto has become the payment of choice for kidnappers, drug dealers, smugglers and gamblers. Virtual cash has also seized the imagination of technocrats and investors: Since 2010, a single Bitcoin has gone from being worth less than 1 cent to $5,300.

Crypto’s signature qualities appeal to privacy advocates and thieves alike. Theft, said Brian Krebs, owner of the cyber-news site KrebsOnSecurity, is “irreversible.” What you lose, he said, you can’t get back.

Over the past 15 months, more than $50 million in cryptocurrency has been stolen from accounts like Terpin’s. He kept a portion of his virtual cash in a digital vault called a “native wallet,” which required a string of 12 random words to unlock. The hackers were able to cobble the code together once they hijacked his phone and wormed into his email — both of which were shockingly easy to do.

“It begins with finding a target and his wireless carrier,” Terpin said. As he alleged in a court document, an employee in a Norwich, Connecticut, AT&T store had been induced to “port over my wireless number to an ­imposter with a new SIM card.”

One of the thieves then contacted Google and claimed to have forgotten his Gmail code. As is standard, Google texted a recovery code to the phone number on file — in this case, Terpin’s Blackberry, which the thieves now controlled.

They changed the code, freezing Terpin out. A cadre of confederates, communicating in an online chat room, ransacked Terpin’s ­email, finding clues that led to everything from his Skype account to private databases containing personal information.

Seconds after breaking into Terpin’s wallet, the crew transferred $23.8 million into an online account they controlled. Forty-eight hours later, said Terpin, the thieves had laundered the crypto and presumably divvied up their haul.

“Your phone goes dead and theirs is alive,” Terpin said. “Then they own you.”

One of Terpin’s key suspects in that multimillion-dollar takedown, according to a lawsuit he filed, is ­21-year-old Nicholas Truglia.

Truglia, who grew up in New Jersey, was, at the time of the hit, a registered student at Baruch College. (Late last year, weeks prior to his arrest, he told The Post he was on “a leave of absence from Harvard.”) Either way, he hardly lived like an undergrad.

His apartment in the Sky building overlooking the Hudson rented for $6,000 a month and a visitor named Chris David said Truglia piled stacks of $100 bills on a credenza. As David, a private jet broker in his 20s, reported in a court document, “Nick told me that [the] bundle contained over $100,000. At the same time, Nick showed me two thumb drives. One had over $40 million cash value of various cryptos.”

In the same document, David claimed Truglia told him he made his fortune by stealing crypto, which explained his $100,000 Rolex. One night, in a crowded lounge, David stated in a court document, “[Truglia] said, ‘Chris, I have more money than all the people here ­tonight.’ ”

Experts believe the crypto bandits’ crime spree is rooted in video games. Teens playing “Call of Duty” communicated via a social site called Discord, setting up private chat groups that keep out predators and parents alike.

Several years ago, cool social media handles became hot commodities, said Erin West, a cyber-savvy deputy district attorney in Santa Clara County, Calif. “Gamers figured out that they could hack into people’s accounts to get these handles and sell them for big bucks on a website,” she said.

They deployed the SIM swapping technique, perfecting it as they focused on taking over Twitter and Instagram accounts just as they would one day commandeer online wallets. The most popular social media names were the so-called OG handles — A or @evil or ) — so simple, they had to have been staked as soon as social media took off. Goofy as it sounds, these sales were no joke: @t sold for $40,000 in crypto.

Sometime around 2016, cyber-account crackers upped their game and began pillaging digital fortunes. Technologically, it was an easy leap. “My guess is that someone was hacking for names and stumbled upon crypto in the process,” an investigator who works these cases told The Post. “My theory is that the person took it, had a big score, and crypto became the thing to concentrate on.”

The kids’ lives blew up. One crypto bandit spent $250,000 on a McLaren automobile, and Truglia talked about buying his own jet, as David related in a court document. They were, the investigator said, “living like rappers in music videos.”

But for Truglia, at least, money didn’t bring happiness. “Stole 24 million [but] can’t stay away from drugs,” he tweeted ­after the Terpin heist, according to court documents Terpin filed. “Stole 24 million dollars and still don’t have my s–t straight.”

According to David, Truglia scammed his own father out of $15,000, “took delight in cheating people” and “beat his small dog, hitting him with his hand and a broom handle” — a charge Truglia denied to The Post. ­“Nobody can get me in trouble,” he was allegedly recorded saying. “Nobody can put me in jail. I would bet my life on it, actually.”

The scams began to unravel in March 2018, after a Cupertino, California, executive named Mitch Liu lost $10,000 in cryptocurrency.

Though it was a relatively small sum, law enforcers at the Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT), an investigative unit in Silicon Valley, were intrigued.

“We didn’t know how bad guys could convince a carrier to switch over a phone number,” said Samy Tarazi, a sergeant at the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office and a task-force supervisor with REACT. “We started following the [number] and realized that contact with the email service had to connect to a cell tower somewhere.”

In Liu’s case, messages went from zipping around the Bay Area to pinging back and forth from a cell tower in Boston. But the area encompassed dozens of city blocks. “From there,” said Tarazi, “we found the IMEI [International Mobile Equipment Identity] number of the phone that AT&T had switched the SIM card [information] to.”

Every phone has a unique IMEI number just as every car has a unique VIN number. Most every online business records the number when it has contact with a customer. “We took the IMEI number used in the crime and cross-referenced it with Apple and Google,” Tarazi said. “We found it associated with an email account used by Joel Ortiz,” then 18 and a school valedictorian. “We wanted to see where it would go, got the contents of his [email] account and, basically, we had his life.” In other words, they did to the hacker what hackers did to their marks.

Tarazi and his team discovered that Ortiz lived with his mother in a modest Boston home, about a mile and a half from Harvard. Through Ortiz’s braggy posts, investigators tracked him. “He was taking helicopter tours around Las Vegas, partying at fancy nightclubs in LA, staying at … mansions in the Hollywood Hills,” Tarazi recalled.

‘He was taking helicopter tours around Las Vegas, partying at fancy nightclubs in LA, staying at … mansions in the Hollywood Hills.’

When Ortiz posted about plans to attend an EDM festival in Belgium, REACT decided to move in. They busted him at Los Angeles International Airport. He was easy to spot, dressed head-to-toe in Gucci. By the time Tarazi and his team finished interrogating Ortiz, the straight-A student was in tears, said the investigator.

Ortiz copped a plea of 10 years in prison for stealing what Tarazi believes to be $5 million to $15 million in cryptocurrency. Since the start of 2018, five crypto bandits — all ages 18 to 26 — have been arrested, said Tarazi, who believes dozens more remain at large.

Truglia is the latest to be brought down. REACT, working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, arrested him in a raid at his Manhattan digs last November. He was charged with stealing $1 million in crypto from a Bay Area retiree.

Terpin, who reported his theft to federal investigators, is suing both Truglia and AT&T. He’s going after the phone company for negligence and other claims to the tune of $224 million. “I am trying to get AT&T to change things,” Terpin said. “And I want criminals brought to justice.”

A representative for AT&T responded, “Mr. Terpin is wrong, and we have asked the court to dismiss his complaint.”

Truglia’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

As for what lies ahead, Tarazi says he’s aware that the bandits now know his tracking methods. “They adapt, we adapt,” Tarazi said. “For the scam to work, though, someone still has to give up his location. And we’re on top of that.”",2019-04-13,https://news.bitcoin.com/wikileaks-cache-now-hosted-on-ipfs-thanks-to-this-bitcoin-cash-developer/,"Wikileaks Cache Now Hosted on IPFS Thanks to this Bitcoin Cash Developer

With the founder of Wikileaks behind bars, it’s been a trying time for activists who believe in spreading freedom and truth in an age steeped in lies and manipulation from parasitic central bankers and bureaucrats. In order to show support for Julian Assange, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developer Chris Troutner decided to upload the entire Wikileaks cache of documents to the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and the BCH chain so the truth can be read forever.

Truth Is Treason in an Empire of Lies

Since April 11, there’s been a lot of attention directed toward Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. His arrest stems from indictment charges from March 2010 that allege Assange and former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning cracked the country’s Department of Defense server password. The leaks that were distributed back then caused chaos for politicians and financial elites supporting the military industrial complex because they exposed horrific crimes against humanity. One specific video leaked in 2010 by Wikileaks called Collateral Murder displayed a U.S. helicopter gunning down targeted individuals but they also killed innocent people including children, journalists, and Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen age 22.

After the trove of documents, files, and videos were released, Wikileaks faced a financial blockade where payment processors like Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard prevented the website from receiving donations. This was when the Bitcoin network came to the rescue and Wikileaks decided to accept the digital currency for donations. Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley) was charged with treason and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Assange went on the run, faced charges in Sweden for an alleged rape case, and found himself hiding in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the U.K. for the next seven years. Manning was since pardoned by U.S. President Obama before he left office, but was recently arrested for indictment charges against her and Assange. After the April 11 arrest, Assange is now being held in London at the moment and may face charges in Sweden and be extradited to the U.S. as well.

Hosting the Wikileaks Cache of Files on the BCH Chain and IPFS

Lots of Bitcoin proponents have supported Assange and Wikileaks for years for leaking thought-provoking documents without hesitation. Since the arrest three days ago, Wikileaks and Assange have managed to gather $41,000 in BTC donations. Another endeavor that took place in order to show support for Wikileaks was when BCH programmer Chris Troutner uploaded the entire Wikileaks cache to the BCH chain and IPFS. This means the 30GB of files can be downloaded and viewed by anyone at any time for as long as the BCH and IPFS networks exist. The website Wikileaks.cash has the entire database which includes documents stemming from the controversial wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, leaked FBI data, Homeland Security papers, Barclay’s tax avoidance, the infamous Bilderberg meeting transcripts, and FEMA reports.

Of course, Wikileaks.cash can be accessed directly but the archive can also be downloaded via torrent software. Troutner has also published step-by-step directions on how to help syndicate the Wikileaks archive over IPFS. Essentially, you need to install IPFS and initialize an IPFS node to get the daemon running. You can optionally connect the IPFS node to the cloud server and download the content, which also helps syndicate it. From there, you can pin the content so the computer will continue to share it. Troutner’s walkthrough is hosted on Memo.cash which is also embedded into the BCH chain.

The bureaucracy today has created an Orwellian nightmare and many have grown worrisome about the removal of financial privacy and seeing whistleblowers being scorned for telling the truth. A system like Bitcoin, with its censorship resistance, yields many benefits that include furthering the dissemination of information the elite would like to stifle. Having the Wikileaks data hosted on the BCH chain and IPFS helps bolster the documents’ preservation and syndication over time. These days, telling the truth truly has become a revolutionary act and bitcoin cash, with the help of the community behind it, is helping to keep that insurrectionary spirit alive.

Investors who are long-cryptocurrencies have gleefully pronounced that the Crypto Winter, which began when bitcoin’s bubble burst at the end of 2017, is now mercifully over. The most optimistic are forecasting a rerun of bitcoin’s fall 2015 bounce from its prior post-bubble collapse, which sent it not only back above its 2013 high of $1,150 but all the way to a December 2017 peak of $19,500.

At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have pointed to the seeming lack of fundamental news behind the price rise and declared it meaningless. Typical of the genre, Matt Novak at Gizmodo penned an angry screed titled “Bitcoin Surges 15% Overnight Because Nobody Learned Their Lesson After the Last Crash.”

One of Novak’s insights: “To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.”

Readers won’t be surprised to hear that I disagree with Novak’s simplistic rant. But I’m also turned off by the knee-jerk cheerleading from crypto traders whenever bitcoin’s price bounces.

There’s something fundamentally wrong with reducing the measure of bitcoin’s worldwide importance to a price metric that’s denominated in a fiat currency that its advocates hope to replace. It pushes the debate into an inane all-or-nothing binary set of predictions: bitcoin is either going to zero or “to the moon.”

What matters is that 10 years after an unidentified software engineer created it, this decentralized system for recording sequences of transactions continues to do its job, block after block, with no authority in charge, no user able to alter past transactions, and no person or entity able to shut it down.

The more this goes on, the more it reinforces the powerful vision behind bitcoin: a peer-to-peer, disintermediated system for exchanging value around the world. And in that context, we can also think of bitcoin the cryptocurrency – differentiated from bitcoin the system – as a unique, provably scarce digital asset that expresses the overall value in that vast potential.

Bitcoin is valuable because it exists

A point that’s lost on critics like Novak is that the longer bitcoin simply survives – in the face of the $90 billion valuation that stands as a de facto bounty for hackers to try to take it down, compromise its security or corrupt it – the more its overall value is confirmed.

Bitcoin is progressively proving itself to be an unstoppable, digital system of global exchange, one that functions outside of the traditional national government-mandated system of currency and banking. That status is what gives bitcoin its value.

Of course, the global impact of the bitcoin value exchange system, and therefore its worth to humanity, will be significantly enhanced if adoption advances to a much wider scale and it is used frequently in the world’s transactions. And, yes, a great deal of development work is still needed if it is to ever reach that point.

(Some recent technological leaps such as the Lightning Network and the emergence of decentralized, non-custodial asset exchange technologies offer hope that this scaling challenge can be achieved, though nothing is guaranteed.)

However, widespread adoption in payments is not necessary for bitcoin to have value. To understand why that’s the case, it’s useful to think about gold, to which bitcoin is often compared.

The power of common belief

Similar to bitcoin, gold is a mutually agreed store of value that, for all intents and purposes, lies outside the control of nation-state governments and banks. It’s not widely used as a day-to-day currency, but it does enjoy a widespread, shared belief in its value.

Where does gold’s value come from? The answer is somewhat tautological: it comes from that same widely held belief, from a shared understanding in gold’s capacity to function as a depoliticized global system of exchange that’s free of manipulation. Sure, we tend to think of gold in terms of its material qualities: that it’s durable and that it’s shiny in a way that connotes beauty. But its lasting worth really derives from the more esoteric notion that human beings have for a long time deeply held a shared belief in its value.

That belief has turned gold into a system for protecting property, a system used through the centuries by refugees, dissidents and investors for moving and storing value and for hedging against lost spending power. That we now have a digital version of this concept, one that’s designed for the borderless, internet-shaped world of the 21st century, is a big deal.

When dealing with debates over bitcoin’s value, it’s also worth going a little way down the rabbit hole of thinking about what money actually is. Not everyone agrees on a definition, but I think it’s useful to think of money as a societally agreed system for storing and exchanging value. The system has to have certain properties for people to reach this agreement – it must fungible, durable, transferable, divisible, etc. – but it’s the agreement itself that gives it its value.

Here, too, is where many of bitcoin’s detractors get lost.

Fixating on the misplaced idea of money as a thing, they exclaim that bitcoin can’t have any value as it isn’t backed by anything. This, of course, also misses the fact that it is backed by the energy and other resources that miners spend to do the computational work needed to secure the bitcoin ledger.

But the bigger point is that bitcoin’s value, as with all forms of money, comes from the existence of a wide agreement in its potential use as a store of value and medium of exchange.

In bitcoin’s case, the agreement is arguably one that involves 35 million people, if Cambridge University’s latest survey of authenticated users is to be believed. This large level of participation is essentially why bitcoin holds a much greater value than the altcoins that are forks of its code.

So, this is why bitcoin at $5,000 is important, not because it’s a sign of that new investors are coming to push up its price again, but because it validates the core proposition of bitcoin’s resilience and promise.

In the latest edition of its research bulletins, the exchange’s dedicated analytics arm, Binance Research, investigated various current phenomena and trends within cryptocurrency markets.

Among them was correlation between Bitcoin and altcoin prices, data from 2014-2019 confirming that the 90 days to mid-March represented the longest period of high correlation in market history.

According to historical behavior, such periods tend to trigger trend reversals. The 90 days to mid-March incorporated Bitcoin’s drop from $6,500 to around $3,100, leading Binance to suggest that markets could now rebound following the end of the record correlation period.

“Having emerged from a period of the highest internal correlations in crypto history, the data may support the notion that the cryptomarket has already bottomed out,” the exchange summarized.

As Cointelegraph reported, Binance had previously eyed the changing relationship between Bitcoin and altcoin prices, concluding altcoins were becoming less correlated with Bitcoin but more so against USD.

The latest bulletin also held insights about cryptocurrency’s investor makeup: institutional investors control around 7% of the supply, Binance says, roughly equal to one-thirteenth of the institutional control of the United States stock market.

Last week, another well-known voice meanwhile endorsed the narrative that crypto markets had bottomed.

Thomas Lee, senior market analyst and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, pointed to three-year high readings on his so-called “Bitcoin Misery Inde (BMI) as potential proof that no further downside would occur.

“The main takeaway is […] further evidence the bear market for Bitcoin likely ended at $3,000,” he wrote on Twitter on Thursday.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/imf-and-world-bank-launch-quasi-cryptocurrency-in-exploration-of-blockchain-tech,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have jointly launched a private blockchain and a so-dubbed quasi-cryptocurrency, the Financial Times (FT) reports on April 12.

According to the newspaper, the asset called “Learning Coin” will be accessible only within the IMF and World Bank. The coin has no money value and thus is not a real cryptocurrency, the FT underlines.

As the FT has learned, “Learning Coin” was launched in order to better understand the technologies that underlie crypto assets. Its app will serve as a hub where blogs, research, videos and presentations are stored.

During the test, the World Bank and IMF staff will earn coins for achieving certain educational milestones. The institutions will allow them to redeem the assets gained for some rewards, which will allow them to learn how coins can be used in real life.

Per the IMF, the banks and regulators across the world have to catch up with crypto technologies that are rapidly developing. The FT quotes the IMF as saying:

“The development of crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology is evolving rapidly, as is the amount of information (both neutral and vested) surrounding it. This is forcing central banks, regulators and financial institutions to recognize a growing knowledge gap between the legislators, policymakers, economists and the technology.”

Moreover, after the test, the World Bank and IMF reportedly might use blockchain to launch smart contracts, combat money laundering and enhance the overall level of transparency.

Earlier in April, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said that blockchain innovators are shaking up the traditional financial world and have a clear impact on incumbent players. She also noted that the potential of blockchain-based technologies and assets is embraced by regulators and central banks, who recognize its positive effect.

Meanwhile, a World Bank official expressed a more skeptical point of view. According to Aanchal Anand, a Land Administration Specialist in the bank’s Global Land and Geospatial Unit, there is too much hype over blockchain, which causes unrealistic expectations.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/aussie-banks-cold-cryptocurrency-businesses/,"Aussie Banks Still Cold to Cryptocurrency Businesses Despite Regulation

Despite increasing regulation in the cryptocurrency sector, Australia’s major banks maintain cautious policies when it comes to cryptocurrencies. While cryptocurrency businesses appear to challenge Australian banks’ appetite for risk, many institutions permit cryptocurrencies to be purchased using credit cards.

Credit Card Cryptocurrency Purchases Permitted by Many Australian Banks

A spokesperson for Westpac, Australia’s second-largest bank by capitalization, stated that the company “does not restrict [the] use of accounts or credit cards in relation to purchasing cryptocurrency as long as the transaction complies with our legal obligations and terms and conditions.” The policies extend to Westpac-owned St George Bank, Bank of Melbourne, and Bank SA.

The country’s third-largest bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), also does not prohibit its customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies, with an ANZ representative stating that the bank “does not prohibit customers buying digital or cryptocurrencies, or accepting them as a form of payment.” However, the spokesperson added that the bank “monitor[s] transactions for unusual behavior to protect against potential fraud and in line with our regulatory responsibilities.”

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Australia’s largest bank, however, revised its policies 14 months ago to prohibit virtual currency purchases via credit card. Despite this, a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson stated that “customers are still able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using their CBA transaction accounts and debit cards.” CBA subsidiary Bankwest shares the same policies.

Few Banking Options Available to Australian Cryptocurrency Businesses

News.Bitcoin.com was unable to find an Australian financial institution that expressed a willingness to bank cryptocurrency businesses.

Of the major banks, while CBA and Westpac declined to comment on the matter, an ANZ spokesperson indicated that the company’s policy “is to not bank businesses that operate as issuers, dealers or exchanges of digital or crypto-currency as they are outside of our risk appetite.” A spokesperson for regional bank Suncorp also indicated that the company does not provide “services to cryptocurrency businesses.”

The country’s credit union also appears to hold policies that are cold to cryptocurrency businesses, with a Newcastle Permanent spokesperson indicating that the entity does not partner with crypto companies, nor does it permit cryptocurrency purchases using its credit cards.

A spokesperson for Heritage Bank, one of Australia’s largest credit unions, stated: “Due to the high risk and anonymous nature of cryptocurrency trading, Heritage has made the decision not to transact with business accounts that trade in cryptocurrencies.”

The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a private blockchain and quasi-cryptocurrency to bridge the gap between its employees and the blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency will be called “Learning Coin” and will have no monetary value, but the staff will earn these coins after reaching certain educational milestones. The developers are yet to decide on how these earned coins can be redeemed by the staff. This is a major step as it shows that international agencies are making efforts to understand the technology seriously.

In a recent Twitter poll, IMF asked: “How do you think you will be paying for lunch in 5 years?” 56% of the respondents said that they would be paying in cryptocurrencies, well ahead of the 27% by mobile phone. Bank cards and cash were way behind at 9% and 8% respectively. To some extent, this projects the prevailing mood in the masses against cash and bank cards.

Fidelity Digital Assets has appointed Christine Sandler — former head of institutional sales at Coinbase — as head of Sales and Marketing. While the groundwork is being laid out to facilitate the entry of institutions into the crypto space, we are yet to see their presence in a big way.

After the rally from the lows, most cryptocurrencies have cooled off. Will the bears now sink the price back to the lows, or will the major cryptocurrencies form a higher low and indicate a bottom? Let’s find out by analyzing the charts.

BTC/USD

Institutional players are buying Bitcoin (BTC). Their purchase volume, the percentage of the total volume has reached 19% in April. This indicates that the large players expect the bear market to end in the near future. With a rise in prices, the Chinese traders have returned to action. However, due to the cryptocurrency ban in China, they are paying a premium to the over-the-counter services to take a position in Bitcoin. This shows that even in a place where Bitcoin trading is banned, traders are looking at ways to buy it, well above the prevailing prices.

The rise from the lows has pushed Bitcoin to the most overbought levels since the bull run, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone. On the other hand, the “Bitcoin Misery Index,” created by Fundstrat Global Advisors Thomas Lee, has reached its highest level since 2016. This can either be a good sign or a bad sign, according to Lee. But what does our analysis project? Let’s see.

The BTC/USD pair picked up momentum after it broke out of $4,255, quickly climbing above $5,000 and reaching a high of $5,404.82. With this rise, the 20-week EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has inched into the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are asserting their supremacy in the short-term.

On the upside, $5,900 remains a major roadblock. The 50-week SMA is also located just below this level. Hence, we anticipate a stiff resistance between $5,600 to $5,900.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency turns down from the current levels and slips below $4,255. Such a move will dent sentiment and indicate that the bears are still shorting at higher levels. The next few weeks are critical as it will confirm whether the bottom is in place or not.

EOS/USD

FinLab EOS VC fund, a joint venture of FinLab AG and Block.one, has invested $5 million in Moonlighting, a freelancing website with over 700,000 users. The website will now migrate its users to the EOS blockchain. Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and IOHK, also lashed out this week at EOS and Ethereum for their approach to development.

The EOS/USD pair is currently facing resistance at the 50-week SMA. The resistance line is also located close by: a breakout of this can carry the pair to $6.8299. If the bulls ascend above $6.8299, the next target to watch on the upside is $9.3483.

The 20-week EMA is gradually sloping up and the RSI has jumped into the positive zone. This shows that the bulls have the upper hand. On the downside, strong support is at $4.4930 and below it at $3.8723. The 20-week EMA is also close to this level. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend this zone aggressively.

However, contrary to our assumption, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and plummets below the $4.4930-$3.8723 support zone, it will indicate weakness.

ETH/USD

Though Ethereum (ETH) has been losing out to Tron in DApp growth, it continues to be the first choice of developers to build their DApp on, according to a report by DApp analytics website DApp.com. Along with this, the Ethereum network is the sought after option to raise funds through ICOs, according to a report by rating site ICObench. In another report released by the European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum, the Ethereum blockchain was identified as the most preferred platform for the creation of tokens. Will Ethereum play catch up with the other altcoins or will it continue to underperform?

The ETH/USD pair completed an ascending triangle pattern when it closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $167.32. The pattern target following this breakout is $251.64. However, the pair quickly turned around and has again declined below the support at $167.32, which is a bearish sign. If a bullish pattern fails, it denotes weakness. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the 50 level. This suggests a consolidation in the near term. But if the digital currency reverses direction from the 20-week EMA and sustains above $167.32, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Above $167.32, the rally can reach $251.64 and above it to the 50-week SMA.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) blockchain has the fastest growing DApp user base with over 300,000 active users. A Tron-based version of stablecoin Tether (USDT) is about to be launched, which is being viewed as a major win for the network. Though Ethereum is a competitor, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun believes that Tron will “officially collaborate” with Ethereum as soon as this year.

The testnet of the Sun Network expansion plan is expected to launch in end-May. This will increase the overall capacity of the network, reduce energy consumption and improve security. With a host of fundamental news backing it, can the price start a new uptrend? Let’s find out.

The TRX/USD pair has been trading in a tight range of $0.01830 to $0.02815521 for the past few months. Though it has broken out of the range twice, it has not been able to sustain the higher levels and has re-entered the range within a week. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.

If the pair turns around after taking support at the 20-week EMA, it might again try to sustain above $0.02815521. A breakout above $0.03575668 will confirm a bottom and the start of a new uptrend.

Conversely, if the pair slips below the 20-week EMA, it can remain range bound for a few more weeks. We might get a clear picture in the next couple of weeks.

ETC/USD

Circle-owned exchange Poloniex enabled margin trading on Ethereum Classic (ETC) for non-U.S. customers with a total leverage of 2.5 times. As with all the other coins that are available for margin trading, owners can lend their ETC and earn interest on it. The improving sentiment across the sector rubbed on to the digital currency as it skyrocketed higher on April 7. Let’s analyze its future prospects.

The ETC/USD pair traded in a tight range for 11 weeks before breaking out of the overhead resistance at $5.889. We had expected the price to reach $9.50 levels after breaking out of the resistance, but the pair turned around from $8.084.

Currently, the digital currency is retesting the breakout levels of $5.889. If it rebounds from this level, it will again attempt to rise to $9.50. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $5.889, it can correct towards the lows.

The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the near term.

MHC/USD*

MetaHash (MHC) aims to bring an ecosystem to the users that is fast, completely decentralized, secure, economical to use and easy to operate, according to the firm. Its mainnet was launched on June 29 of last year, and it has a transaction speed of about 3 seconds and a declared capacity of 50,000 transactions per second. MetaGate is its official browser software, which has a multi-currency wallet and a DApps store; among the notable DApps launched are a blockchain-based encrypted messenger and a voting application.

The idea behind MetaHash is to enable businesses and systems to easily use blockchain for various applications, the website states. It has been recognized as the 2018 Best Performance Project at POWER 2019 China Blockchain Contributors Annual Summit. The total number of server nodes has been increasing continuously and now numbers 500.

The MetaHash coin is currently ranked 151th on CoinMarketCap. As most of the MHC coins are locked in node-stakes and other network economy, the supply in exchanges is usually scarce. Most of the coins bought at exchanges are withdrawn to the network native wallets.

Currently, BitForex has a trading competition in progress using MCH where an award of up to 5 Bitcoin is on offer. MetaHash also has noted that it plans to be listed on various other exchanges in the near future. How does its performance look on the charts? Let’s analyze.

The MHC/USD pair listed at $0.027813 on February 21 of this year. From there, the pair hit a low of $0.020628 on February 28. This proved to be the lowest point where buying emerged. It quickly pushed the price to a high of $0.106901 on March 22, which is a gain of 418%.

After such a sharp rise, a minor correction or consolidation is to be expected. Currently, the price has corrected to just above $0.060, which is a critical support. If the bears sink the digital currency below this level, it can drop to $0.032.

On the other hand, if the price rebounds from the current levels, it can again retest the highs. If the bulls push the price to new highs, a rally to $0.14 and higher is possible. We should see a decisive move in the cryptocurrency within the next few days.

After US-headquartered major crypto company Coinbase announced its new Visa debit card for their UK clients this week, another provider or Visa card for payments with cryptocurrencies, Crypto.com, claims it already has more than 100,000 card reservations in the US and Europe.

“We are going to launch in the US soon, and Europe will follow shortly after. It’s going to be the only cryptocurrency card available globally this year. We think that we have a product that’s very competitive even against major banks. Currently, we have over 100,000 card reservations. That global rollout is a big part of our strategy to increase the size of the platform,” Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of the Hong Kong-headquartered payments and cryptocurrency platform, told Cryptonews.com.

The MCO Visa Card, which is paired with their wallet and is accepted by all retailers that work with Visa, is available in Singapore since October 2018. Back then, the company planned to issue 100,000 “cryptocurrency Visa prepaid cards” over the next two months. However, Marszalek declined to comment on their results in more detail, only saying that all their services have 400,000 users in total. It includes wallet users, trading, credit services, and crypto payments.

Meanwhile, Coinbase plans to support customers in unspecified other European countries in the coming months, however, there is no timeline on the new card’s launch in the US. Also, Singapore-based digital wallet and payment card company TenX launched their card in January this year and now their roadmap includes expansion in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019, only.

Trading, mainnet and partnerships

Kris Marszalek

Meanwhile, according to the CEO, crypto trading transaction volume on their platform “went up by 25x” in the first quarter this year.

“We’ve released new perks and tighter pricing, and deployed a new trading engine designed to give you the best prices when trading through our app,” Marszalek said, adding that they expect that the next time “the market turns” is probably next year. Also, they’re are working on “some new strategies” that would address their users’ suggestions that they would like to see “more aggressive portfolio.”

The company has also deployed their so-called Chain testnet on March 20th, and the mainnet itself is planned for next year, although there is no date set at this point.

“We’ll start processing transactions with our merchants very soon even though the mainnet is not live yet. Even though it’s off-chain, the entire infrastructure will very closely mimic what will happen on-chain when the mainnet is live. The testnet is open-source, so we get a lot of feedback from the community,” Marszalek said.

Additionally, the company is looking for partnerships in three specific categories: traditional payments, which means integrating local payment networks in different regions to offer better services; consumer flywheels, which includes companies that will help them reach millions of users; and technology partnerships.

“We keep the approach that we don’t want to invent everything in house,” the CEO said. “Each of these categories we’ve had some good traction so we’ll be announcing those soon.”

CRO coming to new exchanges

The CRO token, which serves to enable interoperability between cryptocurrencies and fiat payments, is one of the two coins that power the project. The other is MCO, used in the ecosystem in order to earn rewards on purchases and staking, and to pay for referrals. In other words, MCO is the app’s utility token, while CRO will be the native settlement system.

In March, CRO was listed on cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, and it has seen distinct upwards movement in the past week with a total increase of a whopping 80%. However, since it is significantly younger than its MCO counterpart, it is also listed on fewer exchanges, but that is also set to change.

“Our MCO token is listed on more than 30 exchanges and CRO on just five or six, so this is an ongoing process, and we expect to list on every major exchange to provide maximum liquidity to the token. There’s definitely more listings that are going to happen soon. If anyone wants to guess where CRO is going to trade, they can check where MCO is already trading - that’s a good proxy,” Marszalek said.

I grew up at the dawn of passwords. I pretty much just had to memorize my parent’s address and phone number to get around. Occasionally I’d need my social security number and birthday, but life was pretty simple back in those days.

It was really only after the advent of the Internet that the amount of memorization needed to manage my life became overwhelming… fast.

There are personal passwords for video game consoles, mobile marketplaces, online services, apps, accounts, and more. Then everything is multiplied by the amount of business accounts and passwords needed for the various websites I contribute to, business tools, etc.

In my finances alone, there are multiple banks, payment services, investment services, money management apps, and more that I log into. And that’s not even including my crypto investments, which is the point of this article (and website).

And none of these should be the same (although honestly, most of our non-crypto passwords inevitably are). It’s too easy to find passwords online.

For starters, all of Yahoo’s 3 billion accounts were breached in 2013, leaving access to a trove of online passwords, security phrases, etc.

Marriott, Friend Finder, Adobe, eBay, Equifax, Sony, the United States Postal Service, and so many other databases have been hacked for information. Your information is definitely included in the pile, regardless of how secure or private you are online.

So will blockchain and crypto make our lives easier or more difficult with all these keys, seeds, passwords, and other authentication games?

The Crypto Conundrum

Every time I test a new blockchain project or wallet, sign up for an exchange, or invest in a new token, I’m creating yet another set of crypto keys.

In fact, password management has long been a struggle for me, and cryptocurrency is what finally made me invest in password aggregators like LastPass and two-factor authenticators like Yubico’s Yubikey.

I typically hate creating a single point of failure, but I’m just too busy to have friction in moving between services and devices. That’s what this cloud-based world is all about.

But even storing both passwords and crypto keys in LastPass and securing it with two-factor authentication isn’t guaranteed.

Everyone ‘knows’ a cold wallet is the most secure way to store keys, but is it really?

When 30-year-old QuadrigaCX CEO Gerry Cotten died suddenly this year, he took with him the only keys to $137 million in cryptocurrency. The single point of failure in technology is always humans, and we’d be wise to always remember that.

And even if he hadn’t died, Cotten could have simply lost the keys. That’s right – you’re not the only person who lost a crypto key you couldn’t recover. TV shows from The Big Bang Theory to Broad City and Alone Together made lost bitcoins a source of comedic material.

A 2017 study from Chainalysis estimates approximately 3-4 million bitcoins are lost. That’s over $15 billion worth of lost bitcoins sitting out there in the ether. To provide a contrast of the stakes we’re playing with, Bloomberg estimates Americans throw away approximately $61.8 million worth of coins every year.

Because so much value can be found digging in our trash, professional dumpster divers are now digging through our landfills to recover this buried treasure.

How long do you think it’ll be before someone decides $15 billion is worth taking?

Nobody would report the theft – how would you even know if something you lost was stolen, and at what point would it be theft anyway?

And widespread quantum computing makes our best military-grade encryption much easier to break these days, so we’re not talking hypotheticals (or at least won’t be for long).

The Solution (For Now)

Of course, encryption and cryptography run much deeper than blockchain and cryptocurrency, or even passwords. We all know our house can inevitably be broken into, and most security systems are only designed to make the process slower and response times faster.

Computer technology is more advanced than ever before, and at this point, we’re just building layers on top of layers. So many redundancies are built into the system that data can always be recovered.

Blockchain is, funny enough, a great solution for helping ease the pain of password management.

Your social security number builds a record, and blockchains like GXChain are hoping to move high-level government and enterprise identity servers into a decentralized and/or distributed model.

Creating data redundancy won’t prevent an attack from happening to you. It’ll just make it easier to stop the damage and recover.

This is why I have backups of backups, even of my cold storage options. I’ve lost a lot in my life (including a bitcoin and litecoin in their early years), and documentation has always been key to recovering it.

The balance between security and usability will forever be our war with technology. And the best solution to date may still be a few scrawls on a piece of paper.

France's National Assembly voted to allow life insurance policies, a popular savings vehicle for the French, to contain funds that invest in bitcoin. | Source: Shutterstock

If you’re wondering if bitcoin will ever attain wide-scale adoption, look no further than France. French insurance companies can soon include cryptocurrencies in life insurance contracts, thanks to a vote by France’s National Assembly.

Pact Act Swings Door Open for Insurance Companies to Invest in Crypto

Deputies overhauled the Insurance Code via the Pact Act, with Article 21 swinging open the door for life insurance contracts to invest in specialized professional funds (SPFs), whose investment parameters have reportedly been “relaxed” as a result of yet another provision. Article 26 gives the SPFs the freedom to invest in blockchain-backed assets. Simmons & Simmons Attorney Emilien Bernard-Alzias told local publication Les Echos:

“With these two provisions, it is written in black and white that SPFs can invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.”

Meanwhile, with no cap on the amount of crypto a life insurance policy can hold, French locals have a chance to bolster the value of their policies in the bitcoin bull market.

Bitcoin Integration More than a Year in the Making

Bitcoin didn’t make its way into France’s life insurance market overnight. Policymakers alongside entrepreneurs and companies worked together for more than a year to make the rule change happen. In the end, investing in crypto is a byproduct of the updated code, not necessarily the intention. Nonetheless, it could set the stage for other jurisdictions to follow suit as France gains a first-mover advantage. Assemblymember Joel Giraud is cited in Les Echos as stating:

“This was not the primary goal of Pact, but insurers will actually be able to offer products based on crypto-assets. They will be able to do so through specialized funds,” stated

Assemblymembers adopted the measure in recent days, with 147 votes in favor, 50 votes against, and 8 abstentions. The vote, however, reflects only about one-third of the 577 seats comprising the Assembly. Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire was pleased with the results.

“Very happy with the adoption of the law PACT! The vote is wide, thank you to the majority for your total support and for all the work that has been done. We are determined to continue transforming our economy,” said Le Maire

French Prefer Life Insurance Products for Savings

The inclusion of crypto in the Pact Act, even if indirectly, is kind of a big deal. France’s life insurance market is reportedly comprised of EUR 2.2 trillion in assets, and French residents tend to rely on these products for their investment and retirement savings, too, on account of tax benefits. In fact, insurance policies reflect 40% of financial assets among French households, surpassing that of securities, cash, and other savings products.

French investors have also flocked to insurance products for savings because in recent years returns have trumped those of other savings products. Now that bitcoin has entered the equation, the French haven’t seen anything yet.",2019-04-14 19:00:39+00:00,https://cryptonews.com/news/jimmy-song-and-willy-woo-joined-new-project-what-is-it-about-3676.htm,"Source: iStock/bee32

Two influential members of the cryptoverse, Jimmy Song and Willy Woo, have announced their participation on the advisory board of an emerging US-based cryptocurrency exchange Level (LVL.co). What is this project all about?

The exchange introduces a new approach to crypto trading, where users are charged a flat, USD 5/month fee for the unlimited number of trades instead of the traditional maker and taker fees per trade. Essentially, it is a subscription model service like Netflix, a major streaming service, but for crypto trading.

Jimmy Song is a well-known Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur. He serves as the project’s technology advisor. Willy Woo, a renowned entrepreneur and independent crypto-asset analyst, is the product advisor for the exchange.

Not an ICO

The cryptoverse is known for influencers “shilling” their own initial coin offerings (ICO’s), coins and projects. Naturally, popular personalities joining new projects may trigger some unwelcome feelings. The situation had prompted Level to release a statement clarifying the project’s relationship with the advisors.

In the statement, Level’s team stresses that unlike ICO’s and similar coin projects, it is an equity company and doesn’t compensate its advisors in cash or crypto. Equity advisors make money only if the project succeeds in the long-run.

“Level is an equity company and not a token project. We don’t have a token, and we will never have an ICO. Our team members, both employees and advisors, are equity owners in the business. And advisors specifically are never compensated in cash or crypto,” is written in the blog post.",

On April 15, Binance announced that the trading platform will be delisting bitcoin SV (BSV). The removal follows the tendentious actions of Craig Wright over the last few weeks in which the BSV creator has sent libel lawsuit warnings to well-known digital currency proponents. Since the announced delisting, the price of BSV has fallen by more than 13%.

Binance Plans to Delist BSV on April 22

Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has decided to delist the BSV cryptocurrency. The news follows recent legal threats stemming from Craig Wright’s team of litigators who are demanding an apology from various prominent digital currency enthusiasts. The first person to receive a letter was an online persona known as Hodlonaut, the creator of the Lightning Torch. According to the letter, Hodlonaut called Wright a fraud and the team is expecting an apology or plans to sue for libel.

The letter claims Wright is Satoshi and that people who are calling him a fraud are participating in slander. Moreover, a Coingeek article details there is a $5,000 bounty for anyone who identifies Hodlonaut. Following this letter, and admission of these legal actions by BSV supporter Calvin Ayre and his publication Coingeek, lots of crypto proponents defended Hodlonaut. Then, on April 11, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) tweeted that “Craig Wright is not Satoshi” and promised if there were any more lawsuit threats the exchange would delist BSV.

BSV Price Drops 13% Following the Announcement

Following the Hodlonaut incident, podcaster Peter McCormack was also sent a letter from Wright’s legal team. McCormack published his letter, which read similarly to Hodlonaut’s, including the same demand for an apology. The podcaster replied to Wright’s lawyers with a formal response and stated he hopes to resolve the issue “quickly and efficiently.”

However, McCormack refused to apologize and stated that he does not believe Wright is Satoshi. In addition to McCormack, it is rumored that a letter was sent to Ethereum’s inventor Vitalik Buterin as well. Then, on April 15, Binance published a blog post stating that it would be delisting BSV for various reasons. Following the announcement, BSV dropped by 13.4% in value to a low of $61.37 while most other digital assets have been seeing decent gains. Binance has decided to delist the coin based on the “level and quality of development activity” and “evidence [of] unethical/fraudulent conduct” among other reasons. Binance further stated:

Based on our most recent reviews, we have decided to delist and cease trading on all trading pairs for the following coin on 2019/04/22 at 10:00 AM UTC: Bitcoin SV.

For years now Wright has claimed he is the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto moniker, an assertion he has emphasized more brazenly in multiple blog posts over the last few weeks. However, Wright’s claims and all of the proofs he has provided have been widely debunked on various occasions. After the BSV delisting announcement, CZ published a long thread of tweets describing why he thinks Wright is “a fraud.”

“The real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it — This is as simple as breathing for him/her,” CZ noted. Meanwhile, the San Francisco exchange Kraken has asked the crypto community if they should delist BSV and Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees revealed that Shapeshift will follow Binance and delist BSV within 48 hours.

The exchange announced Monday that it would be delisting all BSV trading pairs on April 22, just days after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) threatened to do so if Wright did not cease attacks on Twitter users who are claiming he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.

In Binance’s announcement, the exchange says “we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect,” citing a number of factors it weighs.

These include the commitment of a team to the project, the level and quality of its development activity, its network and smart contract stability, the level of public communication, responsiveness to periodic due diligence requests, evidence of unethical or fraudulent conduct and its contribution to the crypto ecosystem.

However, it is likely that BSV is being deleted at least in part due to Wright’s attacks on Twitter user hodlonaut (who started the Lightning Network “torch“) and other individuals. Specifically, Wright placed a bounty on hodlonaut’s identity after the latter claimed Wright is not Satoshi. CZ said Binance would delist BSV if Wright continued these attacks.

Wright has for the last several years claimed he is the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but his evidence for this claim has been widely disputed.

In a series of follow-up tweets, CZ said “Craig Wright is a fraud,” that “the real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it,” and that doing so would be simple.

Wright has sent legal cease-and-desist letters to other individuals claiming he is not Satoshi, including Peter McCormack, the host of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast.

Binance will continue to support BSV withdrawals until July 22.

Later Monday, ShapeShift CEO and longtime crypto entrepreneur Erik Voorhees announced that his crypto-to-crypto exchange would also delist bitcoin SV, for the same reasons. “We stand with Binance and CZ’s sentiments,” Voorhees tweeted. BSV will be removed from ShapeShift in 48 hours, he said.

Another influential exchange, San Francisco-based Kraken, indicated it is at least considering delisting BSV, asking Twitter users in a poll whether it should do so.

The questions below address implications within the United States, but similar issues arise around the world. As always, check with a local tax professional to assess your own particular tax situation.

1. Do I need to report my cryptocurrency trades to the IRS?

You need to report your cryptocurrency activity if you incurred a taxable event during the year. A taxable event is a specific scenario that triggers a tax liability. The below are a list of the taxable events as specified by the IRS 2014 guidance:

Trading cryptocurrency to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar is a taxable event.

Trading cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency is a taxable event (you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade).

Using cryptocurrency for goods and services is a taxable event (again, you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade; you may also end up owing sales tax).

The most common tax event from the above is trading one cryptocurrency for another — for example, trading your Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH).

On the other hand, there are other actions that cryptocurrency enthusiasts also commonly take that are not taxable events and do not trigger a tax reporting requirement. Listed below are scenarios in which traders do not trigger a tax event:

Giving cryptocurrency as a gift is not a taxable event (the recipient inherits the cost basis; the gift tax still applies, if you exceed the gift tax exemption amount).

A wallet-to-wallet transfer is not a taxable event (you can transfer between exchanges or wallets without realizing capital gains and losses, so make sure to check your records against the records of your exchanges, because they may count transfers as taxable events, like they are a safe harbor).

Buying cryptocurrency with USD is not a taxable event. You don’t realize gains until you trade, use or sell your crypto. If you hold longer than a year, you can realize long-term capital gains (which are about half the rate of short-term). If you hold less than a year, you realize short-term capital gains and losses.

An example

Let’s say you buy 2 BTC from Coinbase. You just hold this crypto for the year. In this case, you have no reporting requirement, as you have not triggered a taxable event. Even if you send this to an offline wallet, you still do not need to report this, as merely sending crypto from one place to another is not a taxable event.

Now let’s say you send this 2 BTC to Binance and start trading it for other altcoins. Now you have incurred a taxable event (trading one cryptocurrency for another) and you will need to report this transaction on your taxes and file it with your 2018 tax return, even if you lost money on the trade.

Keep in mind that mining cryptocurrency is also taxable and is treated as income.

2. How do I file my crypto taxes?

If you are simply buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies you will report these trades on the IRS Form 8949, as pictured below.

As seen in the above example, you have sold 0.5 Bitcoin. You acquired the Bitcoin on July 16, 2017, and you sold it on December 17, 2017. You sold the Bitcoin for a total proceed of $9,848.00, and your cost basis was $970.00. This led to your gain of $8,873.00 (reported in column h).

You will report each crypto-to-crypto trade and each taxable event from the calendar year on this form.

You can use crypto tax software to automatically build this report for you, if you don’t have your own records of the historical prices, dates and fair market values of your trades.

Once you have your net gain or loss calculated from Form 8949, the total will simply flow into your 1040 Schedule D. You should include these forms with your entire tax return upon filing.

Foreign account holdings

If you traded on foreign exchanges like Binance, you may additionally need to report these holdings. You do not pay any tax on these holdings, but it is important that you file the following reports if either situation applies to you.

FBAR: A taxpayer with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a foreign financial account must file a Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) FinCEN Form 114 if the aggregate value of the foreign financial account exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Noncompliance with FBAR would subject a taxpayer to steep civil and criminal penalties. Each nonwillful failure-to-file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000. Penalties for each willful violation could be the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the amount in the account.

FATCA: A taxpayer with foreign financial assets of $50,000 or more must report it under Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements on Form 8938. It is recommended that cryptocurrency-invested hedge fund accounts and cryptocurrency-denominated exchange accounts be reported in the summary information in Part I of Form 8938. Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market.

3. What will happen if I don’t report my crypto activity?

The reality is that no one knows for sure. However, it is not advised.

The IRS publicly stated on July 2, 2018 that one of their core campaigns and focuses for the year is the taxation of virtual currencies. Unfortunately, lack of reporting will be treated as tax fraud.

4. Can I reduce my tax bill by filing my crypto capital losses?

Yes.

When you realize a capital gain — if you sold your crypto for more than you purchased it for — you owe a tax on the dollar amount of the gain. However, when you sell (or trade) your crypto for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss, and you can use this loss to offset gains from other trades or even a gain from the sale of other property — like stocks in your portfolio.

Whenever your total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, you incur a net capital loss. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income — like the income from your job.

If your losses exceed $3,000, then the amount over $3,000 will be rolled forward to the next tax year.

The bright spot in the 2018 bear market is that your losses can reduce your tax bill.

5. Why can’t I get my tax documents from the exchanges that I use?

Cryptocurrency exchanges are unable to provide their users with accurate tax documentation. This is a big problem in the industry.

By the nature of the blockchain technology that exchanges operate on, users are able to send Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to wallet addresses outside of their own network. An example of this would look like you buying Bitcoin through Coinbase and then sending it to a Binance wallet address in order to acquire new coins and assets on Binance that Coinbase does not offer.

Because you can send cryptocurrencies from other platforms onto exchanges like Coinbase at any time, Coinbase has no possible way of knowing how, when, where or at what cost you acquired that cryptocurrency that you sent in. Coinbase only sees that it showed up in your Coinbase wallet.

This means that anytime you move crypto assets off of Coinbase or into Coinbase from another location, Coinbase completely loses the ability to provide you with accurate tax information. This is because it has no way of identifying what your cost basis is in that certain cryptocurrency, which is an essential piece to figure out your capital gain or loss. This is also true of all other major cryptocurrency exchanges.

The solution to this problem is to leverage crypto tax aggregating tools to collect your data from all platforms to build your holistic tax reports.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/review-crypto-is-a-surprisingly-fun-movie-about-compliance/,"Review: Crypto Is a Surprisingly Fun Movie About Compliance

“Fuck” is the first word uttered in Crypto. It might also be yours after watching John Stalberg Jr’s claustrophobic movie about an anti-money laundering agent caught in a web of deceit, intrigue, and bad beer. Copious cryptocurrency references have no tangible impact on the plot, but serve as a running gag for bitcoiners intent on scrutinizing the movie for the slightest sign of inaccuracy.

Beau Knapp Makes Compliance Look Sexy

Just as the shark’s arrival is heralded by that seat-clenching “dun-duuun, dun duuuun” music in Jaws, you’ll have no trouble deducing the bad guys in Crypto. The blast of Russian opera music every time their white van appears saves you from having to think for yourself, which is exactly how we expect our Hollywood movies to be packaged. In Crypto, the music builds the tension rather than the tension building the tension, and the movie’s sins don’t end there. Yet for all its flaws, including a nonsensical plot, Crypto is a fast-paced thriller that simmers nicely before spilling over in a ferocious finale.

AML agent Marti, played by Beau Knapp, is the very personification of the New York Bitlicense. Lines such as “I demand a culture of complete compliance in my department” are prone to make the skin crawl for every bitcoiner watching. Marti gets booted from his big city job for being too good at compliance, whereupon instead of being appointed to the Ripple board, he finds himself exiled upstate to the small town where he was raised.

There, he discovers something has taken root, and it’s not dad’s (Kurt Russell) potatoes. With glamorous art gallery hostesses, sexy assistants, and Russian mobsters skulking about, upstate New York is more NY than NY itself. Upon arriving to find his father’s farm failing, Marti is all set on restructuring loans and bringing in silent partners to save the day. Kurt just wants him to grab a shovel. Metaphors for the gulf between old money and new are all over Crypto.

A Cornucopia of Cryptocurrency References

Five minutes into Crypto and you’ll be praying that goodie two-shoes Marti winds up on the wrong end of a Kalashnikov, such is his toe-curling obsession with doing everything by the book. Marti is so square that when bitcoin bro Earl (Jeremie Harris) who runs the liquor store tells him the beer’s on the house, he drops a 20 on the counter anyway. Naturally, Marti drinks Bud Light. He’s the sort of guy who’d show up at your party and then call the cops cos some people were smoking pot by the pool. Marti mercifully gets some of those square edges rubbed off him as the movie progresses, and it’s hard to find fault with Beau Knapp’s portrayal of the AML agent. In fact it’s hard to find fault with any of the acting in this movie, which is more than can be said for some of the plot points.

Everything has labels in Crypto. It’s like the whole film is an exposition, because the trouble with treating audiences to a movie about cryptocurrency and money laundering is that you have to explain things as you go. Thus we encounter Earl logging in to a cryptocurrency exchange named “Cryptocurrency Market,” in between dropping crypto bro lines such as “Hang on – time is of the essence. I’m getting in on this ICO!” The scene in which Earl explains to a woman how Bitcoin works is a particular highlight.

Early in the movie, Earl shills the hottest new ICO to Marti like it was a brand of potent crystal meth but Marti demurs, presumably because he hasn’t performed compliance checks on the company, and what if they haven’t filed a CTR exemption for those funds? You can tell Crypto was shot in the last throes of the 2018 bull market, incidentally, because XRP is still trading at 60 cents.

Don’t Think – Just Roll With It

It’s not a classic by any means, but there’s plenty to enjoy in Crypto. My nocoiner mate described it as a “really good film” that was “solid” which, if nothing else, suggests that appreciation of the movie doesn’t call for a grounding in cryptocurrency. As Crypto progresses, we learn that Omni bank, which Marti is dutifully investigating, secretly invested $10 million in cryptocurrency in the previous quarter. The significance of this is unclear, but judging by the ominous music, it’s clearly A Bad Thing.

“I’m not entirely satisfied with the way the DD was handled,” spits Marti, always a stickler for doing things by the book, even as the Russians begin circling and the body count rising. He’s a fast learner though, to give him credit: at the outset, Marti confesses to have only understood 5% of Earl’s ICO spiel; by the midpoint, he’s effortlessly dropping insights such as “My guess is they’re buying Bitcoin over the counter to avoid market slippage.”

Director John Stalberg Jr. captures the essence of a small town where everyone’s got a secret to hide, and as the movie nears its climax, there’s no denying that whatever the hell is happening, this is hella fun. It would be asking too much for a movie about compliance to end with anything other than an American three-letter agency riding in to save the day; the Russian mobsters never stood a chance against the barbed quills of Hollywood. Whether you read Crypto as an allegory for Bittrex’s struggle to obtain a Bitlicense, or a brainwashing exercise on why money laundering is bad is your call. Despite having very little to do with cryptocurrency, Crypto is compelling fare for bitcoiners. If only real life compliance was this fun.

Hayes made his remarks during an interview on the Venture Coinist podcast on April 12.

Hayes — a former equities trader for Citigroup — indicated a rough timeline for the prospective launch, stating that:

""We hope to possibly have our own options platform in maybe 12 to 18 months.""

Hayes hinted at aspirations to innovate options listing, saying “we have somebody working with some university professors on a complicated new way of doing this.""

Options are a type of financial derivative that give a buyer the right — but not the obligation — to buy or sell an asset at an agreed price in future. They are designed to serve as strategies for hedging, protection or speculation in different market conditions.

BitMEX was founded in 2014 and currently sees close to $1.1 billion in daily traded volume, making it one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges by reported volume. As a derivatives-only platform it is, however, not included in CoinMarketCap’s price and volume averages for Bitcoin (BTC).

As previously reported, Hayes has recently predicted that Bitcoin will get back to the $10,000 price point this year, anticipating the market recovery will begin in early Q4 2019.

Alongside its trading platform, BitMEX also conducts research into the crypto industry, in January releasing a report on the impact of the 2018 bear market on ICO projects’ token holding valuations.

That same month, the exchange refuted media reports that had alleged it was closing United States and Québec residents’ accounts due to a regulatory crackdown, claiming they were inaccurate and sensationalist.",,https://all-stocks.net/crypto-wallets-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them/,"A cryptocurrency or crypto wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send, and receive digital currency. A wallet will have two components: your public key, and your private key. The public key is the wallet’s address that to which you can send cryptocurrency and a private key lets you access the wallet and withdraw funds.

There are five types of cryptocurrency wallets: online wallets, mobile wallets, desktop wallets, paper wallets, and hardware wallets. You may also hear the terms “hot” and “cold” storage. Anything connected to the internet is considered hot, and anything offline is considered cold.

Most crypto wallets are capable of holding several different crypto coins at once; for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, some wallets will only support certain cryptocurrencies, this is why it’s important to check what your wallet allows if you plan on holding a particular cryptocurrency.

Before you can create your wallet, you need to decide which kind of wallet you want.

Online Wallet: these are cloud-based wallets that you can access at any time across many devices as long as you have an internet connection. Online wallets are popular because they are convenient and almost function like a traditional banking app; however, the drawback of this is that they are vulnerable to theft.

Mobile Wallet: These wallets are also simple and convenient to use since they are an app on your smartphone. You can also use a mobile wallet to pay for items in stores that accept cryptocurrency payment which is a huge plus. If your phone is hacked or stolen, you may run the risk of having your mobile wallet compromised.

Hardware Wallet: A hardware wallet is a physical device, such as a USB, that securely holds your private key inside the hardware. It is essentially an added security step so because if your computer gets hacked, the attackers wouldn’t be able to obtain your private key and your wallet would be off limits. If you lose your hardware wallet, there are also ways to set up a new hardware wallet and retrieve your previous private key.

Desktop Wallet: These are downloaded and installed on your computer and are safer than an online wallet. However, if your laptop is lost, stolen or hacked, it is possible that you will lose control of the wallet and your funds.

Paper Wallet: This is the old school approach to modern tech. Your public and private keys are stored on a physical piece of paper and you can access your account and transfer funds through QR codes. This is a safe approach since no one can hack a piece of paper.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-the-future-of-esports-is-tied-to-cryptocurrency/,"Why the Future of Esports Is Tied to Cryptocurrency

At the League of Legends World Championship Finals in South Korea last year, 100 million viewers tuned in to watch Invictus Gaming defeat Fnatic 3-0 and collect $2.4M in prize money. With its young, passionate and tech-savvy global audience, esports shares evident similarities with cryptocurrency. Not surprisingly, many predict great things for the twin industries whose future may lie intertwined.

The $1 Billion Nut to Crack

With a 33% compound annual growth rate, the $1 billion esports market is highly lucrative. Hundreds of millions of fans regularly watch their esports heroes battle it out in games such as DOTA, League of Legends, Halo, and FIFA at live streamed events whose prize money can run into the millions. To its global audience of digital natives, accustomed to having everything they covet on demand, esports is to entertainment what cryptocurrency is to cash: the natural order of things. Most esports fans are too young to recall the before time, when games were played offline and money was physical.

Already, there are signs of a blossoming bromance between the esports and cryptocurrency industries, with an inflow of investment fueling the projected wave of cryptocurrencies focused around esports and blockchain gaming. Esports team-building platform Dreamteam recently closed a $5M seed round with Mangrove Capital Partners and has secured partnerships with major industry players including last year’s League of Legends finalists Fnatic. David Waroquier, partner at Mangrove Capital Partners, told news.Bitcoin.com: “The massive growth in esports popularity mixed with the fact that gamers eagerly accept the newest types of technology is creating the perfect storm for blockchain. Using smart contracts for tournament winnings, player salaries and sponsorship money creates the fraud-proof environment esports needs in order to sustain its growth.”

Gaming and Cryptocurrency – the Perfect Pairing?

In addition to esports, the gaming industry at large has been aligning closely with the rails that run the cryptoconomy. Ripple turned heads last month when it was revealed to be the backer of a new $100M fund dedicated to blockchain-based games. “Gaming is a $140 billion global industry driven predominantly by digital microtransaction economies, which we believe will benefit immensely from the integrity and resilience of blockchain technology,” said Brett Seyler, the chief platform officer at Forte, the San Francisco-based startup that inked the deal with Ripple. As with esports, the similarities between gamers and cryptocurrency users are manifold.

Effective monetization is critical to sustaining video content creators, most of whom don’t boast the same numbers as the top esports professionals and Youtubers. Pewdiepie made headlines last week for joining live streaming platform Dlive, which accepts cryptocurrencies such as BCH and ETH for purchasing its native tokens. His actions have spawned an array of smaller creators to follow suit.

It remains to be seen whether crypto-friendly platforms such as Dlive last the course or prove to be little more than a flash in the pan. What’s less debatable is that the marriage of cryptocurrencies and gaming, in all its many forms, is inevitable. In case more evidence were needed, on April 15, $1 million puzzle game Satoshi’s Treasure launched, promising a bounty-laden bitcoin wallet whose keys have been divided into 1,000 fragments, spawning a global hunt for the prize pieces.

Bitcoin price

There was a solid rebound in bitcoin price above the USD 5,050 and USD 5,100 resistance levels. BTC/USD tested the USD 5,175 level and it is currently (08:10 UTC) trading in a tight range. On the upside, there is a crucial resistance formed near USD 5,200. If there is an upside break above USD 5,200, the price could test the key USD 5,400 weekly resistance.

On the downside, an initial support is at USD 5,050, below which the price may perhaps test the USD 5,000 weekly support area.

Ethereum price

Ethereum price formed a strong support near the USD 160 - USD 162 area. ETH/USD climbed above the USD 165 resistance and recently tested the USD 170 resistance.

Buyers need to clear the USD 170 and USD 172 resistance levels to start a fresh increase towards the USD 180 and USD 185 resistance levels. On the downside, a break below the USD 160 level may call for more losses in the near term.

Bitcoin cash, eos and ripple price

Bitcoin cash gained bullish momentum and broke the USD 290 and USD 295 resistance levels. BCH/USD is up more than 8% and it even broke the USD 300 level. At the moment, the price is consolidating, with support near the USD 295 and USD 292 levels. On the upside, the key resistances are at USD 310 and USD 325.

EOS jumped back above the USD 5.35 and USD 5.40 resistance levels. The price is up more than 4% and it recently broke the USD 5.50 resistance level. The next key resistance is at USD 5.60, above which the price may revisit the USD 5.80 weekly resistance.

Ripple price recovered recently above the USD 0.315 and USD 0.320 resistance levels. XRP/USD even broke the USD 0.325 resistance before it faced sellers near USD 0.330. The price must clear the USD 0.330 and USD 0.332 levels for more gains in the near term.

Other altcoins market today

In the past three sessions, a few small cap altcoins moved higher and gained more than 8%, including XTZ, LAMB, MXM, INB, NULS, ZIL, WTC, REP and PIVX. Out of these, XTZ rallied close to 17% and LAMB is up around 15%.

To sum up, bitcoin price rebounded above the USD 5,000, but it is still facing a couple of important resistances near USD 5,200. A successful close above USD 5,200 and USD 5,250 is a must for a fresh increase. If not, BTC is likely to decline back towards the USD 5,000 or USD 4,950 support.

The new platform is being managed by eToroX, which is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, the firm announced Tuesday.

Trading in six cryptocurrencies will be offered at launch: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC) and dash. Also available will be 37 crypto-to-fiat pairs, for example BTC/USD and XRP/GBP.

The firm is additionally issuing eToro-branded tokens pegged to eight fiat currencies, including the eToro United States dollar (USDEX), eToro Japanese yen (JPYX) and eToro Euro (EURX), with others available for pounds Sterling; Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars; and the Swiss franc.

The exchange will add more cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and tokens “in the coming weeks,” eToroX managing director Doron Rosenblum said, adding that the firm will also work with other cryptocurrency exchanges to “encourage” them to list its stablecoins.

eToro CEO and co-founder, Yoni Assia, said:

“Just as eToro has opened up traditional markets for investors, we want to do the same in the tokenized world. […] Blockchain will eventually ‘eat’ traditional financial services through tokenization.”

The “greatest transfer of wealth” will occur as financial services move onto the blockchain, Assia said, adding that tokenization of all traditional asset classes, including art, property and even intellectual property, will eventually take place.

Last month, eToro also launched a cryptocurrency buying and selling platform and wallet service in the U.S. The platform allows U.S. customers from 32 states and territories to trade 13 cryptocurrencies. The firm also expects to launch multi-asset trading in Q1 of next year, it said.

The exchange currently allows users to trade bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), ripple (XRP), dash (DASH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC). According to the managing director of eToroX, Doron Rosenblum, the exchange will launch more pairs in coming months.

Moreover, eToroX has launched eight stablecoins that are backed by the New Zealand dollar (NZDX), Japanese yen (JPYX), Swiss franc (CHFX), United States dollar (USDEX), euro (EURX), U.K. pound sterling (GBPX), Australian dollar (AUDX), and Canadian dollar (CADX). The stablecoins will be issued and controlled by eToroX.

Co-founder and CEO of eToro, Yoni Assia, said that the platform is set to bring crypto to a larger range of investors:

“We want to bring crypto and tokenized assets to a wider audience, allowing them to trade with confidence. This is the future of finance. Blockchain will eventually 'eat' traditional financial services through tokenization.”

Assia believes that financial services will eventually be transferred to blockchain, as the tech brings a new paradigm for asset ownership. According to him, traditional asset classes such as art and property will also be tokenized.

In March, eToro officially launched its platform and crypto asset wallet in the U.S. Later the same month, the company announced that it has acquired smart contracts development company Firmo in order to explore and add more tokenized assets.

eToroX, the blockchain division of global investment company eToro, has today announced the launch of its crypto exchange - a secure and regulated trading venue offering a range of cryptoassets as well as a suite of stablecoins.

Commenting on the news, Yoni Assia, Co-founder and CEO of eToro, said: “Just as eToro has opened up traditional markets for investors, we want to do the same in the tokenized world. We want to bring crypto and tokenized assets to a wider audience, allowing them to trade with confidence. This is the future of finance. Blockchain will eventually 'eat' traditional financial services through tokenization.”



At launch the exchange will have a range of instruments including:

•

• 8 fiat-stablecoins (eToro New Zealand Dollar (NZDX),

• eToro Japanese Yen (JPYX), eToro Swiss Franc (CHFX), eToro United States Dollar (USDEX), eToro Euro (EURX), eToro Pound Sterling (GBPX, eToro Australian Dollar (AUDX), eToro Canadian Dollar (CADX)

•

•

• 6 cryptos (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP),

• Dash (DASH), BitcoinCash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC)

•

•

• 37 pairs including BTC-USD, XRP-GBP etc.

•



The launch of the exchange is a natural next step in eToro’s blockchain journey which began with the work with Colored Coins in 2012. eToro was one of the first regulated financial companies to offer crypto, enabling users to trade bitcoin in 2014 and today has 15 cryptoassets on the eToro platform.



The exchange is managed by eToroX, a subsidiary of eToro Group. eToroX is one of the first companies to be certified as a regulated Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC).



Doron Rosenblum, Managing Director of eToroX, said: “We are proud to be one of the first companies in the world to obtain a license for cryptoassets, and one of only a handful of regulated exchanges in the crypto space.



“In the coming weeks and months we will add more cryptoassets, stablecoins and tokens to the exchange and will work with other exchanges to encourage them to list our growing range of stablecoins.”



Tokenization helps open up markets and encourages diversification by facilitating fractional ownership and removing geographical boundaries.



Yoni Assia concluded: “We believe that we will see the greatest transfer of wealth ever as financial services move onto the blockchain. The blockchain brings transparency and a new paradigm for asset ownership. In time, we will see the tokenization of all traditional asset classes, as well as the emergence of new asset classes such as tokenized art, property or even IP. Cryptoassets are just the first step on this journey and we are excited to explore the opportunities offered by tokenization with the launch of our exchange.”",2019-04-16 14:53:00,https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/zengo-wants-to-become-the-crypto-wallet-for-the-masses/,"ZenGo wants to become the crypto wallet for the masses

KZen is about to release ZenGo, a mobile app to manage your cryptocurrencies securely and more easily. There are already countless crypto wallets out there, but the startup thinks they’re all either too complicated or too insecure.

If you own cryptocurrencies, chances are they’re sitting on an exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance. If somebody manages to log in to your account, nothing is stopping them from sending those assets to other wallets and stealing everything.

Worse, if somebody hacks an exchange, they could potentially divert cryptocurrencies from that exchange’s wallets. In other words, leaving your cryptocurrencies on an exchange means you give your assets to that exchange and hope they properly take care of them.

On the other end of the spectrum, you can manage your private keys yourself and rely on a hardware wallet from Ledger and Trezor. The learning curve is too hard for many people. And if you don’t follow instructions properly, you might end up losing access to your wallet or accidentally sharing private keys.

Enough about other wallets, let’s talk about ZenGo . Former TechCrunch editor Ouriel Ohayon and his team think the perfect wallet app involves a smartphone you own paired with ZenGo’s servers.

The company uses threshold signatures, which means that you need both ZenGo’s servers and your smartphone to initiate a transaction. If you lose your device, you can recover your funds. But the startup can’t access your cryptocurrencies on its own.

Behind the scene, ZenGo still uses a public key and private secrets, but everything is completely transparent for the end user.

When you set up your wallet, two private secrets are generated separately and stored in multiple ways — one part is on your smartphone, the other is on the servers. You need both parts to sign a transaction. If you back up your device part to ZenGo’s servers, you can recover all parts in case you lose your device, for instance.

ZenGo can’t directly access the second part on its own because it is encrypted using a decryption code that is stored on your iCloud account. But accessing your iCloud is not enough — if you want to recover your wallet, you need to prove your identity.

That’s why the company stores a 3D biometric face map to let you restore your wallet on a new device. The company partners with ZoOm so that you can create a face map from any smartphone with a selfie camera.

The security model has been open-sourced and I hope many security experts will try to find vulnerabilities. That’s the only way you can know for sure that it’s a secure system.

All of this sounds complicated, but most users won’t even realize what’s happening. I tried the app and it’s a well-designed mobile app. Right now, it only supports Bitcoin and Ethereum, but more assets are on the way. The company tracks your public addresses to notify you when you receive funds.

The app isn’t available just yet. It should launch as a beta this week and arrive in the stores pretty soon.

Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.",2019-04-16 00:00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/gate-io-raises-64-million-for-launch-of-new-exchange-cryptocurrency,"Crypto exchange Gate.io has raised $64 million worth of crypto assets in seven days for its own exchange cryptocurrency that won’t be launched on a blockchain for at least six months.

One of the oldest Chinese exchanges, Gate.io claimed on Monday that over the last week it was heavily oversubscribed with orders totaling $2.99 billion for the so-called Gate Points, which can be used for offsetting trading fees on the platform.

Moreover, each Gate Point further entitles a holder to receive 2.5 Gate Tokens (GT), the native cryptocurrency of Gatechain, the exchange’s yet-to-be-launched proprietary blockchain. Gate.io says it expects the network to go live in the fourth quarter.

According to a blog post published on April 1, the first phase of the Gate Points sale started on April 8 and lasted for seven days. As Gate’s fees are paid in tether (USDT), the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, one Gate Point is worth 1 USDT in reduced fees. The points were purchasable with bitcoin, tether, ether, EOS, or the tokens of rival exchanges Binance (BNB) or Huobi (HT).

Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of Gate.io, told CoinDesk in an interview that the exchange distributed 150 million GTs to successful Gate Point subscribers during the first phase, and in return, collected $64 million as prepaid trading fees. (The initial reward ratio of 1 Gate Point for 2.5 GT depreciated by three percent every day during the first phase.)

Gate.io was founded in 2013 under the name Bter.com by CEO Lin Han. It suffered a hack in 2015, which resulted in loss of some 7,000 bitcoin from its cold wallets.

Following the Chinese central bank’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fiat-to-crypto spot trading in 2017, Bter.com closed its domain, rebranded to Gate.io and dropped fiat trading. The exchange shifted its focus to crypto-to-crypto and Chinese yuan over-the-counter (OTC) trading.

IEO bandwagon

Issuing an exchange token with a trading fee point system rather than a conventional ICO is not unprecedented, as Huobi also issued its Huobi Tokens (HT) in a similar fashion in early 2017. Binance, on the other hand, sold its exchange tokens BNB through a traditional ICO while BNB can also be used to offset trading fees.

But Gate.io’s plan comes at a time when exchange tokens are seeing notable growth in the crypto markets partially due to the emergence of initial exchange offerings (IEOs), which have gained traction on major platforms such as Binance and Huobi.

In fact, Tatibouet said Gate.io will announce a plan on Wednesday to launch its own IEO platform, similar to Binance’s LaunchPad.

She further claimed that on April 8, the day the Gate Points sales began, about $155 million worth of tethers were deposited to the platform’s USDT wallets overall.

Weirong Chen, an analyst from Beijing-based blockchain data analytics startup TokenInsight, said the recent price surge of exchange tokens has bolstered retail traders’ enthusiasm for the area.

She told CoinDesk:

“The demand is indeed correlated with the overall market condition, when exchange tokens have jumped by 150 percent in Q1. Thus retail investors’ anticipation for these tokens to yield a high rate of return is still positive.”

Such interest appears to have also caused an influx of USDT to Gate.io from rival exchanges such as OKEx and Huobi. The resulting scarcity of tethers on those exchanges drove up the stablecoin’s price to an average 3 percent premium over par value when Gate’s sale began.

For instance, for 1 USDT, the bid and ask orders among OKEx’s OTC market makers on April 8 centered around 6.95 Chinese yuan, or $1.03, while some even posted ask prices as high as $1.14 per coin.

Yet Chen said multiple reasons led to the price premium for USDT among Chinese traders, including the demand for Gate’s exchange tokens with a high expectation of return, but also bitcoin’s bull run on April 2.

Tradable promises

But, despite such seemingly high buying interest, it’s important to note that for the time being GT is at best a tradable sign or liability.

Because unlike Huobi’s HT or Binance’s BNB, which were issued as ERC-20 based tokens on the ethereum network at the time when they were sold, GT is not yet issued on any public blockchain with a verifiable contract address.

Based on Gate.io’s announcement, the exchange plans to issue a total of 1 billion GTs, 50 percent of which would be reserved and locked up for a year for research and development as well as marketing efforts.

Another 300 million would be allocated to users who subscribe to the exchange’s trading points, half of which were distributed last week.

Gate.io said trading of GT will be enabled at the end of April but deposit and withdrawal won’t be available until the launch of Gatechain.

As such, Tatibouet acknowledged that for the time being, there are no other ways to track and verify the movements of any GTs, including those that are said to be locked up.

“There will be proof on how this is issued, since not every technical detail has been worked out now,” she said.

Meantime, Gate.io has started the second phase of the Gate Point sales lasting for a week for users who have been on the platform for over a certain period of time. The exchange aims to raise another $23 million in prepaid trading fees this week.

“The trading of GT [for now] will be more like trading credit points that’s entirely closed,” Chen of TokenInsight said, concluding:

“Indeed, investors can’t see how much is really being issued or how much is circulating at the moment – that’s one risk factor.”

By CCN.com: Institutional investors are running out of excuses not to invest in crypto. Israeli-based social trading platform eToro has launched eToroX, a fully regulated crypto exchange. eToroX debuts with half-a-dozen top cryptocurrencies and eight fiat currency-backed stablecoins, the latter of which are now open-source.

One cryptocurrency noticeably absent from the list is Bitcoin SV, which can’t be found on the traditional eToro trading platform, either. Given the timing of eToroX’s launch, which comes just a day after other crypto exchanges have scrambled to delist the cryptocurrency created by the controversial Craig Wright, eToro just dodged a serious bullet.

Opening the Floodgates to Big Investors

eToro Founder and CEO Yoni Assia was the keynote speaker at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit, where he described how eToroX hopes to bridge a divide between the financial markets and crypto with its stablecoins and tokenization of other assets. With less than $200 billion in combined market cap, crypto still has a long way to go. Assia stated:

“[Crypto] is still a drop in the ocean compared to $140 trillion of assets under management [in the capital markets.] That’s a big gap. In the blockchain industry, everything everyone is building will start moving when the transfer of assets starts shifting into the blockchain.”*

He also described the urgency for a trading platform that supports the tokenization of pretty much any asset in real-time 24/7. He stated:

“Most crypto exchanges only trade crypto assets and core assets…in the future we believe the entire ecosystem will enable people to trade new kinds of tokenized assets, whether equity, property/real estate, or art, they will be able to trade and invest in a wide variety of assets coming from countries all over the world.” *

Bruno Le Maire, France’s Minister of Economy and Finance, is looking to position the country as the European leader for blockchain technology. He stated:

“I will propose to my European counterparts the setting up of a unique crypto regulatory framework inspired by the French experience. We will also continue to encourage work on this topic at the G20 level.”

eToroX is open for trading and supports the following cryptocurrencies to start: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DASH, and XRP. In the spirit of tokenization, eToroX’s fiat currency-backed stablecoins trade “against USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, JZD, HF, AUD, and CAD at launch.” Fortune reports that eToroX’s stablecoins will be backed by futures contracts, which kind of steals the thunder of yet-to-launch bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt. eToro has more coins waiting in the pipeline. eToro’s original trading platform boasts 10 million users.

After all, there are still a number of risks associated with holding Bitcoin. There’s the issue of ‘tainted’ coins–coins that may have been used in illicit transactions, and therefore may still carry a numerical associated with those transactions. There’s also the issue of custody–securely storing coins can be a risky business, and hiring an external custody service can be costly.

On the other hand, time is money. As long as investing in a Bitcoin ETF isn’t an immediate possibility, investors are coming up with increasingly creative ways to profit off of BTC and other crypto assets. Crypto lending services have recently reported record profits; crypto futures exchanges are also reporting higher-than-ever trading volumes.

However, there’s another option for investing in crypto that has often gone overlooked in the cryptocurrency space. Despite the fact that they’ve been around for more than five years, crypto tracker stocks have remained a relatively little-known avenue into investing in the cryptocurrency space without actually holding cryptocurrency itself.

Grayscale’s Crypto Tracking Stock Was Created in 2013

Crypto investment firm Grayscale was one of the first companies to successfully establish a cryptocurrency-tracking stock. In 2013, the company established the so-called ‘Bitcoin Investment Trust’ (BIT) as a gateway for accredited investors to gain access to Bitcoin without holding it themselves.

The BIT was designed to operate similarly to products like the SPDR Gold ETF, which allows investors to purchase shares in gold without having to actually buy gold themselves.

Shortly after its creation, the BIT moved into the over-the-counter trading market under the symbol ‘GBTC.’ Investors who had purchased shares in the BIT were now able to sell them in what was essentially a secondary public market.

Similar to Bitcoin itself, purchasing GBTC shares did not require a substantial minimum investment. The shares are technically available to any retail or institutional investor who has a brokerage account.

However, there are some potential drawbacks with this type of investment, depending on your perspective. Bitcoin can still be purchased and used with relative anonymity; using a brokerage account to buy GBTC shares means that one’s investments are very easily trackable. And of course, one can’t use GBTC shares (or similar products) to buy goods and services directly.

One of the major criticisms of the GBTC is that it trades a high premium. However, Daniel Skowronski, Co-Founder & CEO at DX.Exchange, told Finance Magnates that this is a normal part of any new market.

“Premiums are high because [these companies] are still trying to find their way in the institutional space and the crypto space,” he said. However, as these kinds of options become more popular among investors, “liquidity will grow, competition will kick in, and spreads will tighten.”

ETFs vs. ETNs

Another crypto-tracking stock made headlines last August when it was listed against USD shortly following the denial of several high-profile applications for a Bitcoin ETF (exchange traded fund). Bitcoin Tracker One, or CXBTF, had already been trading on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange since 2015.

Suggested articles Why Crypto Payments Can Change the WorldGo to article >>

At the time of its pairing with USD, Bloomberg described CXBTF as “a soft opening of sorts for a crypto ETF, which has been repeatedly shot down by U.S. regulators in recent months amid concerns about manipulation and liquidity.”

Bitcoin Tracker One was launched as an ETN, or exchange traded note. Investopedia describes an ETN as “more like a bond” than an ETF is–meaning that it’s more of a risk. “It’s an unsecured debt note issued by an institution. Just like with a bond, an ETN can be held to maturity or bought or sold at will, and if the underwriter (usually a bank) were to go bankrupt, the investor would risk a total default.” This presents a huge risk–in some respects, perhaps even greater risk than holding Bitcoin itself.

Bitcoin Tracker One may have also been particularly attractive to investors who did not want to trade BTC-based assets at a high premium, like Grayscale’s GBTC. “Our products historically have not traded at a premium and are liquid,” said Ryan Radloff to Bloomberg. Radloff is the chief executive officer of CoinShares Holdings Ltd., the parent of the company that offers Bitcoin Tracker One.

Despite its pairing against USD, most US-based customers are barred from investing in the Bitcoin One Tracker.

Pick Your Poison

Because of the fact that these options don’t offer any leverage on the value of Bitcoin, profiting off of investing in crypto-tracker stocks is basically dependent on Bitcoin’s performance as an asset. Crypto lending and crypto futures trading offer more opportunities for profit when Bitcoin itself may not be doing very well, but if you’re trying to get as close to pure Bitcoin investing without actually purchasing Bitcoin, crypto-tracking stocks may just be your best bet at this moment in time.

The bottom is that “[they provide] exposure to a new asset class in a form familiar to the rest of your investment portfolio,” wrote Moe Adham, Founder and CEO at Bitaccess, in a Forbes report.

Additionally, this method of investing in Bitcoin may save you a major headache when it comes to filing taxes. “You won’t need to set up a new brokerage account or file your taxes any differently than normal, which can be a huge time-savings come year-end,” he said.

However, as more affordable crypto custody options may become available, investors may eventually wish to take the leap into investing in Bitcoin directly.

Kyle Asman, partner at BX3 Capital, argues that actually, investing directly in Bitcoin could be much more efficient than purchasing crypto tracking stocks.

“Crypto-tracker stocks are just another gimmicky investment product,” he wrote in an email to Finance Magnates. “I could see an ETF that holds a basket of the top 5, 10, or 50, but if someone is considering investing in a tracker stock, they are much better to invest directly in the asset, such as Bitcoin, and save themselves all the management and performance fees associated with purchasing a tracker.”

Investing in a Crypto Company

If purchasing a crypto-tracker stock seems to closely tie with Bitcoin markets, investors could also consider investing in a company that is part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem without getting anywhere near cryptocurrency assets themselves.

There is some evidence to suggest that as the cryptocurrency ecosystem has continued to grow and mature, crypto companies may benefit from price bumps in cryptocurrency markets. Following the bullish boost that cryptocurrency markets saw at the beginning of the month, some publicly-owned cryptocurrency companies saw boosts in their stock prices.

Bloomberg reported that “crypto-linked stocks in Asia also extended gains, led by Remixpoint Inc. in Japan with a jump of as much as 16 percent during the day Thursday. It’s up 26 percent so far this week. Vidente Co. has climbed almost 20 percent since the weekend, while Omintel Inc. is on a 6.3 percent advance.”

Bitcoin’s price surge has also boosted crypto stocks around the world https://t.co/r251l6SpGP pic.twitter.com/xynaBgNfOa — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) April 4, 2019

US-based crypto companies’ stocks also benefitted. Riot Blockchain Inc. saw a 24-percent boost in the first week of April, while DPW Holdings Inc. and Marathon Patent Group Inc. (two smaller crypto firms) saw gains of their own.

Hopefully, a Bitcoin ETF will eventually be approved–this would be a great way for a new group of investors to securely enter into the cryptocurrency markets. But until that day, we just have to continue working with what we’ve got.",2019-04-17 11:51:59+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/e-commerce-giant-rakuten-opens-its-new-crypto-exchange-to-customers,"Japan’s equivalent to Amazon, e-commerce giant Rakuten, has started accepting account registrations for its new cryptocurrency exchange, Rakuten Wallet.

For now, only customers who have an account at Rakuten Bank or who already have a Rakuten member ID can sign up in preparation for the launch of trading, the firm’s website indicates. It’s not yet clear when it will accept applications from the wider public.

The firm said in an announcement it has also rolled out an automatic support service using AI (artificial intelligence) technology to answer customer inquiries. It’s also planning to soon launch a mobile app allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies, as well as to make deposits and withdrawals.

The firm received a license for its cryptocurrency exchange late last month from the Japanese Financial Service Agency. The exchange is therefore registered with the Kanto Local Financial Bureau as a virtual currency exchange service provider under the country’s Payment Service Act.

Rakuten Wallet was previously known as Everybody’s Bitcoin, an exchange Rakuten acquired for $2.4 million last August. A rebranding of the entity to Rakuten Wallet took place on March 1, at which time the older service was closed.

Rakuten said last August that it believes “the role of cryptocurrency-based payments in e-commerce, offline retail and in P2P payments will grow in the future.”

“In order to provide cryptocurrency payment methods smoothly, we believe it is necessary for us to provide a cryptocurrency exchange function,” it added.

Rakuten’s e-commerce site started accepting bitcoin payments in 2015, when it integrated its U.S. website with bitcoin payment processor Bitnet.

Bitcoin bulls may have a long-wait for the cryptocurrency to retrace all-time highs according to UBS research analyst Kevin Dennean .

Should the bitcoin bubble follow the recovery path of the Dow Jones after the 1929 stock market collapse, bulls will have to wait over 22 years.

Watch Bitcoin Trade Live.

Bitcoin has rallied more than 40% year to date, taking the controversial cryptocurrency above $5,000, though the reasons for the price spike are not immediately clear.

Despite the recent rally, the broader collapse of the cryptocurrency has largely followed the path of previous bubbles, according to data compiled by UBS analyst Kevin Dennean.

As shown in the chart below, the bitcoin collapse is indexed to other well-known bubbles such as crashes of the Dow Jones in 1929, the Nikkei in 1989, the NASDAQ in 2000, Oil in 2008 and Shanghai A-shares in 2015.

FactSet, coinmarketcap.com, UBS

Dennean said crypto-bulls point to other bubbles and recoveries as a template for bitcoin's return prospects.""The argument here is that bitcoin has gone through its bubble phase and is ready to rise phoenix-like from the ashes just as other assets and indices did in the past,"" writes Dennean in the research note.

However, those waiting for a crypto-recovery may have a long time to wait before bitcoin reaches previous peaks.

""We're struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to the recovery often are,"" Dennean wrote.

With the exception of Shanghai, all the asset classes (including Bitcoin) collapsed by more than 75% from peak, with only the Dow Jones and NASDAQ recovering to previous levels. Nearly 30 years after the collapse of the Nikkei, the index has still not recovered and currently trades at about half its peak level.

""Maybe crypto-bull contingents should consider what happens after the bubble - not every bubble that bursts recovers the old highs,"" Dennean wrote.

Bitcoin is up 40% year to date and 74% down from its all-time high of $19,783.21 reached in December, 2017.

NOW WATCH: The founder and CIO of $12 billion Ariel Investments breaks down how his top-ranked flagship fund has crushed its peers over the past 10 years",,https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/coinbase-launches-in-11-countries-with-crypto-to-crypto-conversions-only/,"Coinbase has been available in 42 countries around the world before today — mostly in North America, Europe, Australia and Singapore. Today, the company is aggressively expanding by opening 11 countries at once in Latin America and South East Asia. But there’s a trick — there’s no crypto-to-fiat conversions.

Coinbase competitor Binance has taken the crypto world by storm by focusing on crypto-to-crypto conversions. You can only fund and withdraw cryptocurrencies from your Binance account. And if you want to buy some crypto assets, you need to convert crypto assets you already own. For instance, if you want to buy Litecoin, you need to convert Ethereum into Litecoin.

That strategy has paid off, as it is much easier to start accepting customers in new countries if you don’t need to connect the exchange with the traditional banking infrastructure.

So Coinbase is doing the same thing and opening crypto-to-crypto conversions and trading in Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Chile, India, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and New Zealand.

Eventually, the company could add crypto-to-fiat conversions in some of those new markets. “We may add fiat to crypto support depending on the different demands and requirements of each of the countries,” a Coinbase spokesperson told me.

Both Coinbase and Coinbase Pro are now available in those new countries. Coinbase also says that crypto-to-crypto transactions now represent the majority of trades across the industry.

This is also a great way to get started with cryptocurrencies. If somebody wants to send you some Bitcoin, you can start accepting payments on your Coinbase account. This could be interesting for cross-border payments in particular.

Coinbase supports a stablecoin called USDC. This crypto asset is directly indexed on the value of USD. So if you think the cryptocurrency market is going down, you can convert your assets into USDC to make sure the value of your assets won’t fluctuate too much. But USDC might not be available from day one in today’s new markets.

“USDC is available in most of the recently supported countries through Coinbase Pro. As we continue to receive feedback from our customers, we’ll support USDC in more markets and platforms based on what will offer them the best trading experience,” a Coinbase spokesperson told me.

Disclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.",2019-04-17,https://www.coindesk.com/japans-biggest-bank-invests-in-crypto-investigation-startup-chainalysis,"Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, has backed an additional $6 million Series B round for cryptocurrency sleuthing startup Chainalysis.

The investment came via the bank’s venture capital unit, MUFG Innovation Partners, Chainalysis said Tuesday. The round also saw participation from Tokyo-based investment firm Sozo Ventures.

The additional funding means Chainalysis’ total for its Series B round now sits at $36 million. It raised $30 million back in February, in an initial round led by venture capital firm Accel Partners.

With the additional investment, Chainalysis said it aims to expand its Asia-Pacific business and open a new office to assist that effort.

The startup said it has already significantly grown its business in the region, claiming to have more than doubled client numbers and increased contracted revenue by “more than 16x” last year.

“Chainalysis plans to build on this momentum with a physical presence and deeper engagements with entities including Sozo and MUFG, who will provide critical market insights,” the firm said.

In April 2018, Chainalysis raised $16 million in Series A investment from Benchmark Capital, and launched a cryptocurrency compliance tool, called Chainalysis KYT (for “know your transaction”), which it says provides transaction analysis in real time.

MUFG Innovation Partners CEO and president, Nobutake Suzuki, said in yesterday’s announcement:

“Chainalysis’s compliance technology is important to providing the insight and anti-money laundering controls banks need in order to establish next generation compliance frameworks.”

Founded in 2014, Chainalysis notably helped investigations in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case, in the attempt to locate the collapsed exchange’s missing bitcoin.

Last week, the startup published a public comment letter in response to a draft recommendation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), saying that it is unrealistic and harmful for the crypto industry to expect exchanges to send know-your-customer (KYC) information to recipient platforms with every transaction.

MUFG image via Shutterstock",2019-04-17 09:00:26+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3389678/whats-a-crypto-wallet-and-does-it-manage-digital-currency.html,"A cryptocurrency wallet is a piece of software that keeps track of the secret keys used to digitally sign cryptocurrency transactions for distributed ledgers. Because those keys are the only way to prove ownership of digital assets – and to execute transactions that transfer them or change them in some way – they are a critical piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Better known as ""crypto wallets,"" they are like the keys to the blockchain car. Without those keys, the car won't run. And without them, there would be no way to prove ownership of a digital asset - anything from a bitcoin to a token representing some kind of asset.

What a crypto wallet does

Not only does a crypto wallet (or more generically, a digital wallet) keep track of encryption keys used to digitally sign transactions, it also stores the address on a blockchain where a particular asset resides. If the owner loses that address, they essentially lose control over their digital money or other asset, according to David Huseby, security maven for the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project.

Coinbase Coinbase's crypto wallet user interface.

There are two main types of crypto wallets: hardware and software (also known as cold and hot storage wallets, respectively). Hot storage wallets are accessible via an internet service such as Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges that supplies online wallets for users, and can be further segregated into online wallets and client-side wallets managed locally on a user's computer or mobile device.

There are also paper wallet generators, which create keys that can be printed out or rendered as QR codes.

Cold storage wallets are downloaded and reside offline on a piece of hardware such as a USB drive or a smartphone. Exodus.io and Dash QT are two examples of cold storage wallet software. Cold storage wallets can also be purchased as devices with the software already installed on them; these kinds of devices are sold by vendors such as Trezor and Ledger.

Hardware wallets can be further divided into crypto-assist type wallets that simply handle the keys and signing of arbitrary data and are sometimes called hardware security modules (HSMs). ""And then there are hardware wallets that handle generating and signing complete transactions that are then sent to the distributed ledger network,"" Huseby said.

Trazor Trazor's USB-based cold storage dongle.

When you communicate with the blockchain, the hardware communicates through the codes on the device. It's not a very friendly user interface, though, according to Gartner Vice President of Research Avivah Litan.

Hot and cold wallets – which is more secure?

A cold storage wallet is innately more secure than a hot wallet because it's not connected to the internet. Most cryptocurrency attacks have occurred when a hacker hits an online wallet service and transfers the secret keys to their own wallet – essentially transferring the associated funds, as well, according to Litan.

In 2014, for example, the Japanese online crypto exchange Mt. Gox suffered the theft from its hot wallet of 850,000 bitcoins valued at more than $450 million. And in 2018, bitcoin exchange service Coincheck suffered a theft of almost $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency from its hot wallet service. Many smaller thefts have taken place over the past five years, mostly through the hacks of online wallets.

""One of the commonest attack vectors used to steal funds from blockchain cryptocurrency accounts is [a] takeover of customer accounts. This is the primary reason we recommend not storing any cryptocurrency balances in online wallets,"" Litan wrote in a research note earlier this year.

How to bolster crypto wallet security

Gartner recommends converting cryptocurrency into fiat money – cold hard cash, as in real dollars, Euros, Yen or some other currency – for safe-keeping, or storing crypto keys in a cold wallet. The latter then means making a paper copy of the keys and storing that paper in a secure place such as a bank safety deposit box.

Paper can also be used as a type of wallet through software that creates a QR code that can be scanned to enable blockchain transactions. Otherwise, Gartner recommends the use an online exchange with a wallet service that enforces two-factor authentication through push technology. Push technology binds the second factor to a registered mobile phone, so that only an owner's phone can approve an access request pushed out by the exchange wallet's authentication service.

Centralized wallet services have been lucrative targets in the past because hackers could make off with millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency in just a few minutes. But cryptocurrency hackers have also successfully stolen the SIM identity of a mobile phone with a phone-based wallet on it, according to Huseby.

It's important to recognize that determined criminals can circumvent most phone authentication techniques using a variety of methods, according to Gartner. These include ""SIM swaps,"" where a thief registers an existing number to his or her phone, so that push notifications or messages are sent to that phone, instead of to the legitimate owner. Hackers do this typically through social engineering of mobile phone customer service representatives, Gartner's report said.

There have also been thefts of cryptocurrency via malware planted onto a cryptocurrency owner's device, allowing their secret keys to be stolen.

""There are ways to mitigate all of these attacks, but the best solution so far is to use some kind of hardware wallet and also to have a hard copy backup of your secret keys somewhere safe,"" Huseby said. ""The hardest part of wallets is that they are responsible for secure storage of small, highly sensitive data. Most people are not familiar with the levels of security and paranoia that is required to truly defend against people determined to steal your keys.""

Ledger Ledger's Nano S USB-type cold storage crypto wallet.

The danger of lost keys

The main problem with a cold wallet, however, is if you haven't backed up the information on it or stored a hard copy of it somewhere secure – and you lose that device – you lose your digital assets for good. Simply put, you no longer know where your cryptocurrency resides on a blockchain or have the keys to authenticate that you are the owner.

Hot storage wallets, in contrast, have the benefit of service provider support. If you lose your access code to the wallet, there are challenge-and-answer questions that will allow you to recover them.

Conversely, there are limited methods for recovering private keys in a cold storage wallet that has been lost, and they are generally not easy to use. For example, Coinbase allows users a restore mechanism that consists of 24 random word recovery phrase users are supposed to record when they create their wallet.

Blockchain ledgers work based on a trustless consensus mechanism, meaning you don't need to know the person or people you're transacting with on the ledger. A distributed ledger will trust any transaction properly signed by a valid secret key. That's why protecting keys is so important.

""Wallets serve the purpose of storing those keys securely and doing the digital signing necessary for the distributed ledger to accept the transaction,"" Huseby said.

Beyond digital currency: other uses for crypto wallets

While the vast majority of crypto wallet applications are used to store cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple or Litecoin, the software can also store the keys to fungible and non-fungible digital tokens representing goods, financial assets, securities, and services.

For example, a token stored in a crypto wallet could represent concert or plane tickets, unique artwork or goods in a supply chain – virtually anything with a digital value attached to it.

All distributed ledgers with decentralized consensus mechanisms rely on the capability security model, which means possession of an encryption key – proven with a digital signature over a transaction – authorizes the action the transaction represents.

""So any application modeled on a distributed ledger requires users to have wallets that they use to sign transactions that work for that application,"" Huseby said. For Bitcoin, the transactions just transfer bitcoins to another encryption key and therefore to another owner. For things like a supply chain, they sign transactions that track the asset being managed (e.g., electronic parts, raw materials, etc).""

In the future, a new, ""trustless"" global economy could be based on blockchain and crypto wallets that enable everything from individual financial or professional histories, tax information, medical information, or consumer preferences to corporations maintaining employee or partner digital identities and controlling application access.

Digitized representations of traditional identity documents such as driver's licenses, passports, birth certificates, Social Security/Medicare cards, voter registration info and voting records could also be stored in crypto wallets, giving owners control over who has access.

And making those crypto wallets even more valuable, and making it even more important that they be secure.",,https://www.coindesk.com/binances-singapore-fiat-to-bitcoin-exchange-is-launching-next-week,"Cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance will launch its new fiat-to-crypto platform in Singapore next week, its chief financial officer said.

CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao announced in early April that the Singapore fiat “on-ramp” would be coming sometime this month. But speaking to CoinDesk Wednesday from Paris, Binance CFO Wei Zhou gave a more precise timeframe.

“Next week we are going to launch the Singapore simple buy/sell on-ramp,” said Zhou, who was in town for Paris Blockchain Week. “It will actually be a new product we are launching, as a very easy buy/sell platform so users in Singapore can buy and sell bitcoin with Singapore dollars.”

Zhou said that for now in Singapore, “it will just be bitcoin, but we hope to add more [cryptocurrencies]. For a lot of these regulated jurisdictions, it’s easy to start with things that people know and understand and you can gradually build on that.”

Binance began its project of building fiat-to-crypto gateways in January when it partnered with Simplex to let traders use Visa and MasterCard to buy a wide range of cryptos. Then in March, it launched Binance Lite in Australia which allows users to buy bitcoin at newsagents in over 1,300 locations across the country.

The company’s expansion in recent months has been both rapid and eclectic, taking in Europe and the U.K. via the islands of Malta and the British Crown Dependency of Jersey. The company has also set up in Uganda citing the need to bring financial inclusion to the underbanked in that region. It is currently the No. 5 exchange by 24-hour trade volume (when excluding no-fee trades and transaction mining), according to CoinMarketCap.

Asked if the exchange had any designs on North America, Zhou said:

“We have plans for U.S. but I can’t go into these right now.”

Clear the DEX

Binance has also embarked on plans to start a system of decentralized exchange (DEX), which is going to be built on Binance Chain, the exchange’s home-grown ledger to transfer and trade blockchain assets.

In terms of the timing of that, Zhou noted that the Binance Chain testnet is up and running and “we hope to release the mainnet by the end of the month as well.”

He said there are a couple of reasons for pursuing a DEX route. As well as providing trading functionality, exchanges, by their centralized nature right now, hold customers’ assets, making them juicy targets for hackers.

“That is a risk that we do not want to take in the long run,” said Zhou

Speaking philosophically, Zhou also pointed out that change is the only constant in crypto. Two years ago 90 percent of trading was fiat to crypto; today 90 percent is crypto-to-crypto, he said. Hence:

“I think the key here is that innovation is going to happen regardless of whether it comes from us or other people – so we would rather be proactive.”

It’s possible to disrupt your own business model and do so in a virtuous way, Zhou added. “We are almost there, very close.”

Old money

Regarding the expectation that large swathes of institutional investors from the traditional finance world are waiting to enter the crypto sphere at some point soon, Zhou said Binance has seen institutional trading increase some 40 percent to 50 percent over the past six months.

According to Zhou, these institutional traders are leveraging Binance’s application programming interface (API), heralding a new type of institution entering the space. These players wield less capital than, say, a typical tech-focused hedge fund, but they operate in a way that is “highly nimble, highly algorithm-driven and highly efficient,” he said.

This will characterize the new money entering institutional crypto trading, said Zhou, adding:

“I think right now, all the world is focused on what they call ‘old money’ – which is great, but I think the style of a lot of these institutions just don’t move at crypto speed.”

In the context of crypto trading, algorithmic trading strategies interact directly with the technology of an exchange. Traders can develop their own applications, using programming languages like Python, and execute trades using the API.

“It’s basically my code fighting against your code fighting against another code – figuring out each one,” said Zhou.

The news was revealed in a Gemini blog post on April 15.

SegWit is a scalability solution for the bitcoin network, first activated in late 2017. As well as increasing block size, Segwit moves the “witness” signature data to a separate location. It thus solves what is known as transaction malleability, which is conducive to second-layer solutions like Lightning Network (LN).

Claiming that Gemini is the first major crypto exchange to launch full — rather than partial — SegWit support, the blog post’s author, Brian KimJohnson, wrote that Gemini will enable SegWit addresses to be used for both bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The platform has also launched support for transaction batching, he reported.

KimJohnson also wrote that Gemini did not make the decision lightly and that its “choice to use native SegWit addresses was based on block space savings as well as safety concerns.”

His arguments in favor of SegWit emphasize that with its segregation of digital signatures from transaction data, “bitcoin transactions weigh around 30–40 percent less, thus taking up less ‘block space’ on the network and reducing the transaction fee.”

The blog post lastly underscores that the support will lay the groundwork for solutions such as LN — a second-layer solution to bitcoin’s scalability limitations, which works by opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain.

As previously reported, major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase and its professional trading platform Global Digital Asset Exchange GDAX — now known as Coinbase Pro — rolled out SegWit support for bitcoin transactions in early 2018.

Both Coinbase Pro and Gemini have recently been included in a newly-launched index for 10 cryptocurrency exchanges from crypto analytics firm Messari. The index, dubbed “Real 10 Volumes,” was evidently created in response to widespread concerns over allegedly rampant fraudulent trade volume reporting among unregulated exchanges.",

",,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-reveals-timeline-for-bnb-cryptocurrencys-move-off-ethereum,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched its new custom blockchain, Binance Chain, which will support its $3 billion BNB cryptocurrency that currently runs on ethereum.

Announced Thursday, the exchange said it will activate BNB on the new network on April 23, after which holders of the token are encouraged to migrate their balances to the new network. Old ethereum-based tokens will be destroyed as new BNB tokens are created on Binance Chain, the company said, in order to maintain a constant supply across both networks.

The initial total supply for BNB tokens will be 200 million, 48 million of which will be frozen and 11,654,398 of which will be burned on Binance Chain.

On April 23, Binance Chain Explorer and Web Wallet will be open to the public and Binance.com will be able to help users with the mainnet swap. Users will be able to provide a Binance Chain address for BNB withdrawal requests, with the withdrawal then acting “as a mechanism to convert ERC-20 BNB tokens into BEP2 BNB tokens.”

The firm said if users want to keep the ERC-20 version of BNB tokens, they would need to withdraw it into an ethereum wallet before April 23. After that, Binance.com will no longer support the withdrawal of ERC-20 BNB tokens. “Please note that withdrawn ERC20 BNB tokens will only have temporary usage, as all BNB tokens will be migrated to Binance Chain,” Binance said.

Binance noted that the timeline of the above events is subject to change.

Binance first revealed the development of Binance Chain in March 2018. At the time, the exchange also said that it would essentially shift its BNB token to its own native blockchain.

In a recent live ask-me-anything (AMA) chat on Twitter, however, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao explained:

“Binance Coin on the Binance Chain is the same as the Ethereum coin on the Ethereum network. You will have to use it to pay for network transactions, as gas.”

Calculator Answers the Question ‘What if I had Invested?’

Coin Time Machine is an easy to use website that helps answer the question “What if I had invested in cryptocurrency?” It is one of many “FOMO” calculators that are enjoying renewed interest from potential investors. The online platform allows you to estimate what your profit would have been today if you had bought cryptocurrency for a certain amount of fiat on a specific date, or simply didn’t sell your holdings.

The website offers numerous options including major world currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and also the national currencies of countries where cryptos are popular, such as the Turkish lira.

The website can check prices of a great number of cryptocurrencies, including all of the most popular coins. Select a coin and then set a past date in the calendar when you could have made the crypto investment.

Most cryptocurrencies registered significant gains in April. Among those with the largest market cap, bitcoin cash led the pack when prices jumped. According to Coin Time Machine, if you bought $1,000 of BCH exactly a month ago, you would now have 6.15 BCH worth $1,919.50 at the time of writing.

The calculator lets you know the profit you’ve missed to make. In this case, it would have been $919.50 – that’s a 91.95% change. The website also displays a chart showing the price of purchase, which was around $162 on March 18.

If you need a reliable real-time data about the current prices and market valuations of multiple cryptocurrencies, you can always check the Bitcoin Markets cap aggregator. Bitcoin.com also offers you the opportunity to buy BCH and BTC with Visa or Mastercard in USD and EUR.

Cryptocurrencies have disrupted the way we think about money and have evoked strong emotions in those who believe that Bitcoin and the currencies that followed it, heralds a new way of conducting financial transactions, while opponents like Dr Nicholas Weaver, who has been studying the technology believes the entire space ought to be burnt down in a fire. There was even a stronger reaction from Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank who likened cryptocurrency to a “will-o’the-wisp, a malignant marsh dwelling creature that lured travellers from their path to their untimely death and a watery grave.” In a response to Dr Weaver’s attack on Bitcoin, Justin McCarthy, a Fintech specialist from UBU and Project Manager Ricki Allardice has used equally strong words in defending Bitcoin saying Weaver “is another public intellectual who has chosen BTC as a hill to die on” and his arguments are flawed and incoherent. One thing these commentators on cryptocurrencies appear to agree on, is a creative use of language in their arguments. – Linda van Tilburg

In response to Cryptocurrency is cow poo

By Justin McCarthy and Ricki Allardice*

In an article published by Biznews, Dr Nicholas Weaver attacked Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies as technology that is deserving of being destroyed with fire. I rebut many of Weavers claims, several of which are logically inconsistent and patently false. The original interview was conducted on Bloomberg with Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway.

The primary concern raised by Weaver is that BTC doesn’t work as a currency, saying “it cannot compete with payment networks such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard and is significantly less efficient than these incumbent networks.” What Weaver means by efficiency, is unclear as he could be referring to the speed and ease of transferring value, or to integration with other payment gateways.

It’s clear that BTC won’t displace the incumbent networks as the payment processor of choice for the market any time soon. But the network is only a decade old and the development of layer two solutions such as The Lightning Network, are still in testing phases.

Simply, no serious BTC enthusiast expects it to replace Visa anytime soon. This argument is perpetuated by BTC-denialists. However, it’s important to note that BTC is an alternative to the incumbent systems, which gives users choice; to send money privately, quickly and cheaply to anyone who has a BTC wallet, without permission required. This alone is a phenomenal milestone in the development of money and should be celebrated. And because this alternative exists, the incumbent systems are forced to be transparent, as they now have competition from a system that plays by a different and immutable set of rules. The inevitable destructive outcome of fiat monetary systems will eventually manifest, as it always does. Combine this with dangerous central bank monetary policy of zero to negative interest rates (essentially a monoculture across all developed nations) and you have a plausible scenario where BTC may become the currency of choice following a crisis; just look at Venezuela and even Zimbabwe. More importantly, in the event of a global meltdown, BTC could become the global reserve currency overnight, replacing the US Dollar (USD). Even without such a scenario, the chances are increasing daily that BTC will naturally migrate to the global reserve standard.

Elaine Ou:

“Financial institutions make people feel safe by hiding risk behind layers of complexity. Crypto brings risk front and center and brags about it on the internet.”

Weaver attests that BTC is only beneficial to use over conventional payment networks if your interest is criminal activity. A report published last year by The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, confirms that less than 1% of BTC is used for illegal purposes. Enough said.

Regarding BTC acquisition, Weaver claims it is difficult because transactions are immutable. Immutability of the blockchain and the user experience offered by crypto exchanges are separate issues. Purchasing BTC is as simple as opening an account on your local exchange, e.g. Luno, transferring cash from your bank account via EFT and purchasing BTC. If using reputable exchanges, the scam risk is almost zero. Furthermore, the suite of user options to purchase cryptocurrency, range from simple to complex. Entry level users looking for simplicity over privacy, versus advanced users who value their anonymity have various, suitable options available. Weaver details the risk of being defrauded by fake crypto sales as something that even caught Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak out. Presumably this example was used as an emotional play to lead readers into assuming that “if the founder of Apple can’t figure out how to buy BTC, what hope do I have?” Unfortunately Wozniak lost his money, because he didn’t make use of an escrow service, this is nothing more than bad operational security on the behalf of Woz.

The BTC immutability is the most distinguishing feature of the protocol. The fact that transactions cannot be reversed means that no central authority can bully BTC users by blocking or reversing their transactions. This creates an even playing field and a host of benefits for individual user sovereignty.

Security is another concern raised by Weaver. He correctly points out that exchanges and devices can be hacked. This happens regularly. The reason exchanges are hacked is because they act as honey pots for hackers. Once again, this highlights why decentralisation is so important. Exchanges hold large amounts of BTC and fiat currency on behalf of their users, so this custodial risk often leads to security breaches as hackers gain access to wallets connected to the internet. The simplest way to avoid this is by keeping control of your private keys and keeping your BTC on a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor device that is not connected to the internet. BTC allows individuals to become their own bank and just as banks have to secure client funds, so the same applies to BTC users. This is a feature, not a bug.

Furthering the “lack of security in cryptocurrency” claim, Weaver postulates that open source projects, which store their code on Github, may be subject to having code taken over by malicious actors. However, it is broadly accepted that open source projects have higher levels of security than those that make use of proprietary code, as there are more eyes scrutinising it. While it’s true that a hacker managed to inject malicious code into an open source crypto wallet owned by BitPay, the pros of utilising open source libraries far outweigh the cons. This case serves as a warning to other wallet developers that they need to maintain constant scrutiny of their code, regardless of how many contributors they have. Weaver made mention of hacking attempts by North Korea. It stands to reason that North Korea would use BTC if sanctions cut them off from using the USD, which is a feather in the BTC cap. Truth is, BTC protocol itself has never been hacked. Software deployed on top of BTC such as wallets and exchanges are at risk, and for this reason good personal operational security is required by all BTC users.

Weaver further claims that BTC is used by hackers when extorting individuals, as we saw during the Wannacry virus saga of 2017, as well as drug dealers seeking anonymity. By far, the currency most used by criminals, warlords, drug dealers and gangsters globally is the USD. Recent revelations indicate that even commercial banks have been involved with laundering billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels. Money is nothing more than a tool, and blaming it for criminal activity is as asinine as blaming butter knives for the spate of stabbings seen in London recently.

Doubling down on his claim, Weaver questions how long before terrorists use BTC to extort the public with bomb threats and drone strikes. The same could be used against USD or other currencies. Weaver’s unspoken assumption is that BTC transactions are anonymous, which they are not. This is a slippery slope logical fallacy. Admittedly having BTC sent to a wallet is simpler than collecting a suitcase of cash, but spending it is also simpler. This is why terrorists settle for cash – they’re motivated by other factors beyond BTC.

A point made by Weaver around price manipulation within crypto markets is valid. Since the markets are relatively small compared to other capital markets, the ease and prevalence of manipulation is a concern. That said, as the market cap of BTC grows, the influence of individual malicious actors decreases. Concerns of manipulation in the gold and silver markets are present too, with fingers being pointed at the large banks as being conspirators. Similarly, George Soros did damage to the Pound in the early 1990’s. This doesn’t excuse crypto market manipulation, but it does indicate that it is a constant threat across many capital markets. Small alt-coins are more prone to massive price swings than BTC, due to market size, but this comes with the territory of being an asset class that is only a decade old.

Further, Weaver considers every initial coin offering (ICO) securities fraud. While there have been some ICO scams, there are many legitimate businesses too. The ICO model is a new method of raising capital. With the advent of BTC, and later Ethereum, businesses can now raise capital from individuals worldwide, at a fraction of the time and cost of conventional initial product offerings (IPO’s). Incumbents, such as law firms and merchant banks who earn income from the existing IPO framework are not pleased with this. But the ICO model is disruptive, decreasing the red-tape involved in raising capital, including investors who haven’t been involved in stock market investing, and increasing the efficiency of the overall system. Many ICO’s operate in good faith while developing the blockchain industry, which is supported by a recent action of US lawmakers seeking to classify tokens as a separate asset class to securities. While this has nothing to do with BTC, it illustrates the use case for BTC in transferring value from anywhere without permission required.

Weaver welcomes the crackdown of regulators on the cryptocurrency market, but feels that they are reactionary, rather than proactive. Furthermore he claims that the market has all, but collapsed. It’s the nature of bureaucratic institutions to be reactive and regulators are almost always behind the curve as it’s the nature of their role.

To his next point claiming that BTC has collapsed, refer to the chart below.

When speaking about equity markets, it’s commonly known that a five to ten year timeframe must be reviewed before drawing conclusions about the nature of average returns. This is due to varying degrees of annual or bi-annual variations in price. BTC is a volatile asset, and as such, it’s good practice to view it over time when considering the valuation trend. Detractors often reference the bear market initiated in December 2017, when they claim that BTC is dead. Evaluating BTC trends shows the average rate of price growth is 1% per day. Relative to 1 January 2017, the BTC price is still 500% higher as of mid-April 2019. The same cannot be said for all alt-coins, but it’s the nature of the free market. Many projects are destined for zero.

Weaver downplays the point of censorship resistance, which is a key feature of BTC. He claims that if you need censorship resistance, then you can always use cash. He does concede that moving sums of over $1,000 becomes tricky, which indicates that he doesn’t believe his own argument. If you can’t move large volumes of cash around without being censored by the banks, at the behest of governments, then cash doesn’t really provide censorship resistance. It’s particularly distressing is that as of April 2019 the central banks of the Eurozone, Bulgaria, Japan, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland have all implemented zero or negative interest rates. This effectively taxes bank depositors on the capital they have on deposit with their banks. The natural response to this would be to withdraw your cash and keep it in your safe at home, as evidenced in Japan recently. The natural response of the banks and governments in these zero/negative interest rate jurisdictions is thus to outlaw or remove cash. By the admission of the International Monetary Fund on their blog, deeply negative interest rates are only possible in a cashless society, as depositors cannot withdraw their funds from the banking system. This is a very chilling and dystopian future vision. Over the next five years, we might see central banks rolling out crypto versions of their own sovereign currencies, but this is nothing more than an attempt to drive societies cashless. Luckily we have BTC.

The expensive cost associated with BTC and cryptocurrency transactions was cited by Weaver. He claims that Target gift cards are cheaper with a 4% fee. It’s true that in the peak of the 2017 bubble, BTC transactions were expensive, largely due to network congestion. Since then, numerous upgrades to the BTC network have been made to drastically reduce these fees. The most notable are Segwit and the development of Lightning Network. Currently the cost of sending a Bitcoin transaction for $100 at the most expensive rate is around $2.36 via the wallet provider Jaxx Liberty. This fee is reduced if you’re willing to wait a few more minutes. Alternatively, transactions across the Lightning Network cost 1 Satoshi, which is substantially less than the $4 charged for sending a $100 Target gift card. Furthermore, the BTC transaction cost remains essentially the same regardless of the value of the transaction. Traditional middlemen charge a percentage of the value of the transaction, while crypto is a once-off fee. A good case in point, is the first major Lightning Network transaction of $1m of BTC, which took seconds at a cost of just circa $0,02c.

Weaver also makes the case for not holding onto BTC long-term as hackers will steal your coins and price volatility will destroy the value. Neither of these are true. If you’re worried about hacking, secure your BTC private keys in a hardware wallet. If you’re worried about short-term price volatility, convert your BTC into a stable coin such as Maker Dai. Over the long-term, BTC price trends upwards so keeping your money in BTC is a good hedge against volatility. Also, BTC is inflation resistant.

Tether was brought up by Weaver referring to it as a criminal enterprise. While Tether has been central to much controversy, the parent company has yet to be indicted. That said, many stable coin competitors are popping up, and I expect Tether’s dominance to disappear quickly after. Weaver states that Tether is effectively the achilles heel of the crypto industry, and that if US regulators were to crackdown on blockchain enterprises, they should do so by cracking down on Tether. This proves that centralisation creates honey pots ripe for regulatory entrapment. The purpose of BTC is to decentralise. Tether is currently a weak link, but rest assured many blockchain developers are working on a decentralised solution to counter this.

The proof of work algorithm was attacked by Weaver, whereby he claims that it doesn’t provide security against 51% attacks on small chains and that the cost of securing the BTC chain is $5m per day. His first claim is correct. Small chains with low hash-rates are vulnerable to 51% attacks and this is the case with many smaller coins, trying to be currencies. They don’t have the requisite security, from a hash-rate perspective, to be as viable as currencies presently. However, this is not the case with the BTC blockchain, which is currently performing approximately 46,000 giga-hashes per second. This equates to approximately 821,000 Antminer S17 mining units. This is a large amount of hash-power and thus security and would cost close to $1.8bn just to purchase the hardware.

The second claim about the cost of securing the network is an impossible calculation to make accurately. In order to calculate the total electricity cost of the BTC blockchain, you’d need to know what the individual electricity input costs of each mining farm are. This data is simply not available. This is a wildly inaccurate and irresponsible remark.

BTC miners exploit areas with surplus electricity and/or is faced by a distribution challenge. This means BTC miners buy excess electricity from producers who can’t sell their power otherwise. Since BTC mining is highly competitive, the bulk of commercial miners purchase surplus electricity this way, as they can obtain it very cheaply. They tend to aggregate in areas with large excess power capacity, mainly China, India, Georgia and Iceland. The result is that using standard USA household electricity rates when calculating the cost of securing the BTC Blockchain over-estimates the cost by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, what the statistic does not indicate is that BTC mining is a net gain for society, as it uses power that would otherwise be wasted. To go even further, over 77% of all energy used in BTC mining operations globally is sourced from renewable energy sources. Should a malicious actor wish to attack the network, they’d need to purchase electricity at standard rates, since it is presumable that most cheap electricity is already being utilised by BTC miners. The cost to attack the network is far greater than the cost of securing it, which is compounded by the fact that an attacker would need to have a larger amount of hash-power than all other miners combined just to alter the last block mined.

This misinformation was taken further when Weaver insinuated that BTC could enter a mining death spiral if the price of the BTC token does not increase soon. This is not true. Firstly, while the price of BTC has dropped from near $20,000 to $5,000 since December 2017, more than three times the amount of hash-power has been allocated to mining. So it is obvious that there is no imminent mining death spiral.

Moreover, if the BTC price drops, fewer miners will mine as their fixed costs are greater than their profits made from mining. This effect is compounded by the difficulty adjustment algorithm taking two weeks before adjusting difficulty downwards, at which point, the price has dropped more and mining difficulty needs to be adjusted downwards again. So the cycle continues until there are no miners left. In reality this is not the case, as this argument fails to take human action into account. When Bitcoin price drops, some miners switch off their mining rigs, because they are no longer profitable. This is specific to every miner, as they all have different input costs. As miners leave the mining pool, those who remain effectively gain a larger share of the mining pool without having to spend any additional resources, and profitability goes up. This ensures that hash-rate doesn’t drop. Weaver’s argument assumes that BTC nodes will stand idle while watching BTC die, which won’t happen. The rules of BTC can be changed as long as consensus is reached between all parties. Thus in the “Death Spiral” scenario, the BTC community might implement a change in the protocol, which causes the difficulty retargeting algorithm to be implemented every three days instead of every two weeks, for instance, addressing the problem caused by a delay in difficulty retargeting. Either way, this scenario is unlikely to occur, and positive incentives are built into BTC to combat this.

In closing, it appears Weaver is another public intellectual who has chosen BTC as a hill to die on. Many like him have built their reputations on BTC-denialism, but their arguments are flawed and incoherent. BTC provides an alternative to billions of people who may yet choose to opt out of the conventional financial system or at the very least, aid in keeping the incumbent system honest.

The Hawaii congresswoman — who’s in the midst of a long-shot bid for president — signed on to legislation this month that would effectively block U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversight of cryptocurrency.

Gabbard of course made headlines in 2018 when she revealed in her financial disclosure filed with the House that she had purchased shares in both Litecoin and Ethereum, two blockchain currencies similar to Bitcoin.

Unfortunately for Gabbard, her purchases of the two cryptocurrencies — each ranging from $1,001 and $15,000 — came at the height of the market and plummeted shortly thereafter.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat

According to Roll Call, the bill Gabbard endorsed is backed by the blockchain industry. But there are still some who are concerned that the lack of SEC oversight could let bad actors off the hook.

The bill’s main sponsor, however, says it’s the lack of regulation that will allow the technology to thrive in the U.S. so that competitors such as China don’t dominate the market.

“Without it, the U.S. is surrendering its innovation origins and ownership of the digital economy to Europe and Asia,” Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said in a statement announcing the introduction of his Token Taxonomy Act.

“In the early days of the internet, Congress passed legislation that provided certainty and resisted the temptation to over-regulate the market. Our intent is to achieve a similar win for America’s economy and for American leadership in this innovative space.”

Gabbard’s own statement at the time was similarly optimistic.

“In Hawai’i and across America, local and state leaders are looking at the potential for blockchain technology to create and expand economic opportunity,” Gabbard said.

The Token Taxonomy Act, she added, will not only protect investors and foster innovation, but promote new business opportunities that “allow more diverse districts like mine to have greater security when participating in the digital economy.”

Gabbard’s stake is more than personal. It’s a new part of her day job, at least when she’s not too busy traveling the country and running for president.

This year after Democrats reclaimed control of the House she was re-appointed from the Foreign Relations Committee to Financial Services, which is led by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California.

That means Gabbard will be involved in more oversight of the banking industry in general and — with Waters as chair — investigations into President Donald Trump’s own financial dealings.

In February, the congresswoman even put out a call for applications so she could hire a new deputy chief of staff, one she preferred would have a strong background in communications and finance.",2019-04-18 09:28:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/statistics-show-bitcoin-cash-is-a-strong-contender-after-crypto-winter/,"Statistics Show Bitcoin Cash Is a Strong Contender After Crypto Winter

Over the last few weeks, bitcoin cash (BCH) and the network itself have been shining brightly after a year of bearish sentiment and the blockchain split last November. Most notably, this month BCH has shown a significant increase in daily transactions, the price has doubled, and today the network has produced the second highest value of onchain transactions settled in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin Cash Network Processes More Onchain Value Than Most Blockchains

Bitcoin cash has been on a tear lately and it’s not just the markets that have seen significant improvements. The network itself has shone greatly this month by processing a lot more transactions per day and settling roughly $940 million in onchain value over the last 24 hours. The only cryptocurrency ahead of BCH today is bitcoin core (BTC). BCH has processed 2x more onchain transaction value than ETH and 4x more than LTC. This has been a consistent trend ever since BCH doubled in price not too long ago. In addition to the onchain settlement, cryptocurrency exchanges have been swapping a lot more BCH than they had months prior. Exchanges like Hitbtc, Binance, Coinbene, Lbank, Coinbase, and Huobi are contributing to the $1.2 million in global trades swapped in the last day. Bitcoin cash has also consistently captured the sixth most traded coin by exchange volumes within the entire cryptoconomy for a few weeks in a row.

After the blockchain split in November, we mentioned in our Q1 BCH markets and network report that the Bitcoin Cash hashrate was recovering after the overall hashrate dropped below one exahash per second in the middle of December. At the time, news.Bitcoin.com detailed that BCH miners were processing 1.8 exahash per second at the end of Q1. Since that report was published, the hashrate has continued to climb significantly.

According to Coin Dance BCH statistics, miners have gathered 2.5-2.78 exahashes per second on a daily basis. Moreover, since the price doubled, the profitability between mining BTC and BCH has leaned more toward the BCH side in the last three weeks. Meanwhile, unlike other cryptocurrencies that see their fees rise when the price per unit spikes, BCH network fees are still incredibly cheap. At the time of writing it is 188.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC chain.

Increased Transactions and Development

There’s been an increase of BCH usage since the price jumped 91% as there’s been a great number of new projects lately pushing real-world use. The BCH network has seen daily transaction data also increase significantly at the end of March and during the first two weeks of April. On various occasions this week the total number of BCH transactions per day has surpassed coins like dash, litecoin, and dogecoin. The data for Thursday, April 18 according to Fork.lol shows that the BCH chain processed 41,852 transactions in the last 24 hours and around 1,750 per hour.

As mentioned above, there’s been a lot of development lately within the BCH ecosystem and this has contributed to the increase in onchain transactions. There’s the influx of SLP tokens and some of the latest tokens are now held on exchanges with real-world value. The micronation of Liberland’s SLP token, merits (LLM), has a market valuation of $952,253 at the time of writing. Moreover, BCH enthusiasts have made hundreds of SLP tokens onchain and users have been trading these coins for fun. Lots of other development has taken place with projects like Badger Wallet, the Last Will Platform, Cashshuffle, Blockupload, Crescent Cash, Bchgallery, Menu.cash, SLP Lode Runner, Neutrino, Lazyfox, and Taskopus. Cashshuffle has been very popular and there was a total of 2,027 BCH ($622,289) shuffled according to statistics recorded last week. Furthermore, BCH supporters are looking forward to Schnorr Signatures this May. Between Schnorr, Neutrino, and Cashshuffle, the BCH network will be packing a whole lot of privacy protocols.

Additionally, the BCH application Cointext, an SMS-powered BCH wallet that enables permissionless access to borderless cash by allowing people to text bitcoin cash to any mobile phone, is now supported in 42 countries. Overall, across social media and forums, most BCH fans are pleased with the market and network achievements over the last few weeks, deeming these metrics a lot more meaningful than the vitriol that various cryptocurrency factions have expended on Twitter lately.

In the statement, Yang — who is currently vying for the Democratic Party nomination among a crowded field of candidates — indicated his goal to “create clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift.” With the move, Yang becomes the first 2020 presidential hopeful to stake out a specific position on cryptocurrency policy.

Yang cited three problem areas that, in his view, need addressing: “Cryptocurrency and digital asset markets have developed faster than regulations can keep up….Several states have conflicting and varying regulations on digital asset markets….[and] Uncertainty in what regulatory framework will develop is causing US investment in the area to lag behind the investment of other countries.”

“It’s time for the federal government to create clear guidelines as to how cryptocurrencies/digital asset markets will be treated and regulated so that investment can proceed with all relevant information,” the statement reads.

The policy statement additionally cited additional following pledges should Yang be elected president, writing:

“As president, I will…promote legislation that provides clarity in the cryptocurrency/digital asset market space by: defining what a token is, and when it is a security (e.g., recognizing “utility tokens”)….Define which federal agencies have regulatory power over the crypto/digital assets space….Provide for consumer protections in the space….Clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets….Promote the nationwide adoption of recognition of protections afforded by a series LLC….[and] Preempt state regulations when possible to create one national framework.”

Yang’s call for tax clarity is notable, given the push by industry advocates as well as members of Congress on the issue. Coin Center, a D.C.-based firm, also highlighted Yang’s desire to focus on state-based money transmission laws.

“We are happy to see that Mr. Yang is taking the issues facing cryptocurrency developers and users seriously,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, told CoinDesk in an email. “He has identified the most pressing issues affecting this technology and seems have come to the right conclusions on how to best address them.”

Yang’s statement specifically cites the Token Taxonomy Act — which was recently re-introduced to Congress in a bid to cryptocurrencies a clearer regulatory footing in the US — as well as the expansive work done to date by legislators in the state of Wyoming.

CoinDesk contacted the Yang campaign earlier this week for comment regarding its position on cryptocurrencies as well as data on its crypto-related fundraising to date, but has not heard back as of press time.

The 13 deals put the flows on track for a second straight annual record.Such bets, by companies including London Stock Exchange Group and Microsoft Corp, spiked over five-fold to a record $2.4 billion over 117 investments in 2018. This suggests large companies see promise in the nascent technology, even as it struggles for acceptance.They have mostly given digital coins, including bitcoin , a wide berth, avoiding direct investment because of worries over tightening regulation, frequent security lapses and high volatility.The lack of mainstream embrace has sown serious doubts over the potential of cryptocurrencies to evolve from speculative tokens to means of payment capable of rivalling fiat money.Bitcoin slumped by three-quarters last year after nearing a record of $20,000 in its frenzied 2017 bubble. It's still prone to wild price moves, underscored by a recent 20 percent jump that caused puzzlement among traders and analysts.And though blockchain has found some use in sectors such as trade finance, its application has been relatively narrow.Firms are looking at how, and if, blockchain and related technologies can be used in ways that could spark deeper change, said Richard Hay, UK head of fintech at law firm Linklaters.""There are two dynamics at play,"" he said. ""We can get something up and running and achieve cost savings, and also look longer term at ways of deploying the technology in more transformative ways.""Recent examples include a $20 million investment involving the London Stock Exchange and Banco Santander in a London startup whose platform can be used to issue debt on blockchain, the technology that underpins most digital coins.The investments span startups from makers of cryptocurrency mining gear and exchanges, the PitchBook data to April 8 shows.One key driver is a growing expectation that the ""tokenisation"" of assets from stocks to oil - essentially digitising them and allowing them to be traded on blockchain - will upend markets, lawyers and consultants working with fintech firms said.""People are really enamoured by tokenisation - the ability to produce coins or other forms of value - so that's where we see all of the action at the moment,"" said Anton Ruddenklau, global co-head of fintech at KPMG ""They are investing as a technological hedge as much as anything.""Bets involving corporate venture capital are usually small, the data shows. Deals this year had a median value of $6.5 million, a notch below the $8 million of last year.Others are much bigger.Bakkt, a cryptocurrency trading platform founded last year by New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, raised in December over $180 million from investors including M12, Microsoft's venture capital arm.The rush of corporate venture money comes as traditional venture capital (VC) investments also pour into the sector. Last year 617 deals totalled a record $5.6 billion worldwide, the data shows, as venture capitalists assess how the technologies will impact the online economy.""There is a huge experimentation in effectively the basic plumbing for a native economic layer to the web,"" said Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, a fund that has led investment in around eight blockchain-related projects.But with that experimentation has come examples of failure.In December, cryptocurrency project Basis said it would shut down and return funds to its backers including Google owner Alphabet's venture arm GV and Bain Capital Ventures because of concerns over regulation.Cryptocurrency miners and exchanges make up the four biggest VC-backed firms by valuation, according to the PitchBook data.Some have struggled amid the slump in bitcoin prices. The $12 billion-valued Bitmain Technologies, for example, last month shelved a planned initial public offering in Hong Kong.Others have fared better. San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase, valued at $8 billion, saw non-U.S. revenue grow 20 percent last year to 153 million euros ($173 million), a filing to Britain's corporate registry last week showed.The exchange's UK arm, which books the firm's non-U.S. revenue, accounts for almost a third of the firm's overall revenue, said Coinbase UK chief executive Zeeshan Feroz.That suggests, according to Reuters calculations, worldwide revenue of around $520 million last year - a rare glimpse into the financial health of a cryptocurrency exchange.Coinbase declined to comment.",

Per the report, the accumulation phase is expected to bring bitcoin (BTC) to trade in the corridor between $3,000 and $6,500 until the new bull market gains ground. The researchers suggest that bitcoin whales are currently accumulating the leading cryptocurrency which echoes the bear market from 2014 to 2015.

The analysis reportedly showed that most retail traders have left the current market, while agnostic traders and long-term investors have become dominant. That reportedly fits BTC volatility lows analysis, wherein recent bitcoin 60 day volatility slumped below 5% — a level not seen since late 2016. The report further explains:

“During the accumulation phase, the market will trade in a range: the weak hands, who are trying to get out of the market, take profit during rallies and thus create the resistance, and the strong hands, looking to accumulate, buy at the bottom of the range which eventually creates a floor in the piece.”

Millenials are also one of the key drivers of the cryptocurrency market growth, the report says, as 92% of this generation does not trust banks and the majority of bitcoin buyers are also millennials. The researchers forecast that bitcoin will see mass adoption in the coming five years, as well as become widely recognized as a portfolio hedging instrument and reserve asset.

As previously reported, research by blockchain-focused company Clovr revealed that cryptocurrency investing is most popular among millennials earning from $75,000 to $99,999 annually. Millenials are reportedly almost twice as likely as any other generation to invest in digital currencies, with 43 percent of men and 23 percent of women investing in crypto.

Another poll by crypto finance company Circle showed that 25 percent of millennials said they are interested in purchasing digital currencies over the next 12 months, which sets them apart from other generations by more than 10 percent.",,https://www.paymentsjournal.com/will-visa-mastercard-paypal-be-eclipsed-by-crypto-not-soon/,"One needs to evaluate opinions based on the source, so one expects an article placed in Ethereum World News will have a pro crypto slant, but this is a whopper. The original title is “Will Visa, Mastercard, PayPal Be Eclipsed By Crypto? Bitcoin Data Shows It’s Already Happening”.

Oh really?

First, let me state that I recognize there is a major role for crypto in the market, in fact I just wrote “How Banks Can Safely Do Cryptocurrencies,” but replace the global networks? Not yet by a long shot!

By the author’s own admission bitcoin is slow, he states it “would have taken less than an hour if blocks were running on schedule” Oh, just one hour? On the major networks you get penalized if you can’t respond to an authorization request in 300 milliseconds.

The core premise of this article is that it costs less. The problem with this premise is that with the major networks acceptance cost is posted and negotiable if volumes are significant. This isn’t true in Bitcoin where fees will increase based on how much compensation miners get in rewards. The rewards they get are diminishing over time and will continue to decline to zero. So while the author sees a bright future for crypto, I expect increased costs and more exchanges being hacked and more consumer caution – the joys of operating in an unregulated market.

One last thought, the author’s example at the end of article about how much less international remittance would be using bitcoin suggests he is ready to run afoul of several US regulations.

“Since Bitcoin (BTC) garnered some semblance of traction, it has been touted as a viable alternative to traditional digital payment rails, like Visa, Mastercard, or PayPal. As ShapeShift’s Erik Voorhees said in a recent interview, BTC, unlike centralized digital monies, is free to use (accessible), borderless, and uncensorable — arguably making it a perfect substitute. And yes, the leading cryptocurrency is probably best used as a store of value (gold alternative), as scaling efforts are deemed lackluster by pundits, but recent data compiled by BlockData confirms that Bitcoin has potential as a medium of exchange, too.

Through a graphic, Blockdata’s team accentuated that by many measures, traditional merchant payment processors, like Visa and Mastercard, pale in comparison to Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital assets in this age. In fact, as the analytics startup estimated, merchants would see their margins swell by up to 4% if they accepted crypto instead of fiat on credit/debit cards.

As was depicted, a $1,000 purchase through Visa dwindles to $944.20 after all is done and dusted. The financial services firm charges $25.10 as an interchange fee, an intermediary payment processor, PayPal in this case, takes $29.30, and at last, $1.40 is taken as an “assessment fee.” And with that, the end online merchant receives only $944.20 from the $1,000 transaction. It’s the same (slightly worse) with Mastercard.

With crypto, on the other hand, fees across the board are drastically slashed. In a $1,000 Bitcoin transaction, BlockData estimated that the merchant at the end of the equation gets $974.22 deposited in its bank account, if transaction fees are $5 (they aren’t, by the way) and crypto-to-fiat platforms charge a 1% fee. The difference between $944.20 and $974.22 doesn’t seem that noticeable, but it would have a large effect on the retail economy.

And with that, Crypto Michael, an Amsterdam-based trader who reposted BlockData’s chart, claimed that Visa and Mastercard are going to get phased out, as blockchain assets have “outpaced them by a mile” and will “take out the middlemen” making transactions more costly.

Personal anecdote: These statistics aren’t exactly baseless. In fact, mere weeks ago, one of my employers had to pay me through PayPal’s cross-border payment system. Not only did the transaction take days to finalize, but fees surpassed 4%, eating away at my income. If Bitcoin was used, the transaction fee would have likely been under 0.25%, and would have taken less than an hour if blocks were running on schedule. It’s clear to see why so many are taking a liking to cryptocurrencies over their archaic fiat-run counterparts.”

I’ll remain confident in the global networks until I see regulations evolve that establish crypto as a legal form of exchange.

Overview by Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation at Mercator Advisory Group",2019-04-19 19:03:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-accounts-for-98-of-crypto-denominated-ransomware-payments-study,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to account for the lion’s share of crypto-denominated ransomware payments, according to Coveware’s Q1 2019 Global Ransomware Marketplace report, published on April 15.

The report — reportedly based upon aggregated ransomware data from cases tackled by Coveware’s Incident Response Team — indicates that in Q1 2019 the ransomware landscape saw a sharp increase in the average ransom demanded by threat actors.

The average sum — demanded in exchange for the ostensible delivery of a decryptor tool that can help victims recover data after a ransomware attack — rose 89% from a median $6,733 in Q4 2018 to $12,762 in Q1 2019, the report states.

Of these ransoms that were paid in cryptocurrency, 98% were payable in bitcoin. The report outlines that in Q1 2019:

“[H]andling cryptocurrency continued to be a major source of friction for victims, and thus the threat actors as well. It is unlikely that ransomware rotates towards a different cryptocurrency anytime soon as they are even more nuanced to procure and handle.”

Coveware notes that threat actors have scant need to migrate away from bitcoin to other coins as they reportedly face little difficulty using mixing services to exchange bitcoin for privacy-focused cryptos such as dash (DASH) or monero (XMR).

Privacy coins are thus used for only 2% of ransomware payments, according to Coveware’s data, and are largely used later in the process, once the payment has been received and threat actors subsequently attempt to obfuscate the transfer of their ill-gotten funds.

GandCrab — a strain of ransomware that accounts for 20% of the market, according to Coveware’s data — was the only prevalent strain where threat actors accept payment in either dash or bitcoin.

Moreover, the report notes, GandCrab victims who pay with bitcoin face a 10% additional fee due to the costs incurred by the threat actors’ use of mixing services to anonymize the cryptocurrency after payment.

As reported earlier this week, digital payments giant PayPal recently won a cybersecurity patent to protect users from crypto ransomware.

The news was announced in an official FinCEN news release on April 18.

FinCEN — the U.S. Treasury Department’s financial crimes unit — says the move represents its first enforcement action against a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanger.

Eric Powers of Kern County, California, has been served a $35,000 fine and debarred from any future activities that would qualify his work as a money services business, the agency states.

This was determined on the basis that Powers violated his statutory reporting and registration obligations under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as the news release outlines:

“As ‘money transmitters,’ peer-to-peer exchangers are required to comply with the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] obligations that apply to MSBs [Money Services Businesses], including registering with FinCEN [...] maintaining an effective AML [anti-money-laundering] program; filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs).”

According to FinCEN’s assessment filing, Powers conducted over 1,700 transactions as a money transmitter between December 2012 and September 2014, buying and selling bitcoins (BTC) on behalf of customers.

He is reported to have publicized his services on peer-to-peer sites such as bitcointalk.org, and to have coordinated crypto transactions for users of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

The news release states that Powers also processed numerous suspicious transactions — over 100 related to the illicit marketplace Silk Road — without filing an SAR. He is also reported to have conducted business via the dark web client TOR without verifying clients’ identities or the source of their funds.

Over 200 of Powers’ transactions reportedly involved the physical exchange of currency worth $10,000, without filing a CTR. A further 160 BTC purchases — worth approximately $5 million — were reportedly conducted via in-person cash transactions with individuals identified through an online bitcoin forum. The vast majority of these (150) involved the transfer of over $10,000 within a business day — often in coffee shops or other public places.

“We will take enforcement action based on what we have publicly stated since our March 2013 Guidance—that exchangers of convertible virtual currency [...] are money transmitters and must register as MSBs,” FinCEN director Kenneth A. Blanco states.

As previously reported, FinCEN’s director revealed in late summer 2018 that the number of crypto-related SARs filed with the agency had surged, coming to exceed 1,500 per month.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/19/yang-bitcoin-regulations-president-policy/,"Move over John McAfee, there’s a new kid on the block, and they just cemented their position as the cryptocurrency presidential candidate for the 2020 election race.

Andrew Yang released a statement on cryptocurrency and digital assets yesterday, making a bid to regulate virtual assets if elected.

If Yang wins the 2020 race he wants to promote innovation and economic growth by creating clear guidelines for digital assets. He thinks people and businesses should be able to invest without fear of a sudden random change in regulations.

The presidential candidate believes the underlying challenge that needs to be addressed is the uncertainty and confusion of the US’ current cryptocurrency regulations.

He points out that several US federal agencies have taken it upon themselves to try to regulate the industry, but now the country has to deal with a “patchwork of varying regulations.” Yang believes the US has to do better if it’s going to compete in the cryptocurrency space with the likes of China and Europe.

Yang says the US government needs to do more, and act faster, to create a countrywide framework for regulating these assets, though. He says he’ll work with the Token Taxonomy Act and Wyoming legislators, and will model his regulations after their work.

“It’s time for the federal government to create clear guidelines as to how cryptocurrencies/digital asset markets will be treated and regulated,” the announcement reads.

Why do cryptocurrencers love Yang?

Yang has been slowly, but surely, carving himself a foothold amongst the cryptocurrency crowd, becoming a particular favorite on “Crypto Twitter.”

The Democratic candidate started to gain traction after his campaign started accepting donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other coins last July.

In a Facebook “Ask Me Anything” he also declared himself a fan of blockchain‘s “underlying technology.” His apparent pro-cryptocurrency stance has earned himself a band of dedicated followers who call themselves the “Yang Gang.”

He’s also a big proponent of a $1,000 per month “Universal Basic Income,” for US citizens over the age of 18.

But hey, it’s not like politicians always see through on their promises. Take that for what you will, but Yang is certainly doing his best to capture the hearts and minds of hodlers across the US.

Cryptocurrency without privacy is pointless. If your coins aren’t fungible, you lose much of the benefits of using cryptocurrency in the first place. Privacy isn’t just won and lost onchain though. In fact, much of the privacy gains to be made when it comes to sending, spending and trading crypto occur offchain, as you go about your business on the web.

The Never-Ending Quest for Privacy

Privacy is like fitness: a way of life rather than a task that can be ticked off. Just as it takes time, perseverance and focus on different muscle groups to build a better body in the gym, strengthening your privacy calls for undertaking regular exercises to stem the flow of doxable information. Every time you perform an action online, you’re hemorrhaging a trove of data. This can be particularly damaging for cryptocurrency users, whose onchain actions will be recorded indefinitely.

When paired with offchain data points such as IP, email address, and cell number, it’s possible for an adversary to build a complete picture of their target. Given the ever-increasing capabilities of three-letter agencies, it’s safe to assume that in the near future, the state will be able to construct a highly detailed picture of the activities of today’s cryptocurrency users.

tl;dr: privacy matters. Here are five ways to up yours.

Use a VPN

There’s an assumption that using a VPN requires a degree of technical knowledge, and is for privacy zealots only. In fact, the majority of VPNs are foolproof and can be up and silently running in a couple of clicks – no manual port reconfiguration necessary. Opera even offers a VPN now in its desktop and Android browsers. “Enhanced online privacy is a right for everyone,” claim Opera. They’re right. A VPN will provide an added layer of privacy when logging into exchanges as well as masking the IP address associated with Bitcoin transaction relays.

Separate Your Regular Email From Your Crypto Email

Creating a separate email account for every cryptocurrency service you need to log into is impractical. You can, though, segment all of your crypto-related emails into a single account. This will yield twin benefits: if your main account is compromised, the hacker will have no information on or access to your crypto activities. Secondly, if you choose a fully encrypted email account such as Tutanota, prying eyes at border control and other government agencies will have no insight into your penchant for trading obscure shitcoins.

Stop Reusing Addresses

More than half of all bitcoin transactions involve addresses that have previously been used. Creating a new bitcoin address is free, instant, and provides an immediate privacy boost. If the wallet or platform you’re using doesn’t allow you to create a new address at will, stop using it. There’s a wealth of competing services out there, and switching to a more privacy-minded alternative can be done in a matter of minutes. Unless you’re transacting solely in privacy coins like monero, or are using an account-based, rather than UTXO-based, system like ethereum, you should aim for a fresh address every time.

Keep Your Keys and Codes Offline

Where do you store the backup 2FA codes for your trading accounts and the private keys to your crypto wallets? Are they written down, split into parts and stashed offline in a series of very safe places? Or are they hidden in plaintext in a folder on your laptop marked “anime”? You’d be surprised how many people go with the latter. Even if you’ve encrypted the folder containing your keys and codes, it’s dangerous to assume it can’t be cracked by a determined attacker since, statistically speaking, you almost certainly recycle passwords – you and 10 million others.

Keeping your private keys offline will protect you in the event of your computer being physically or digitally compromised. Even if you can’t afford a bank vault or strongbox, separating your key into parts and storing it in multiple locations – with duplicates, to ensure redundancy – will work just as well.

Always Be Shuffling

Coin mixers aren’t for the ultra-paranoid and the ultra-shady: they’re for everyone. If more people ran their coins through tumblers before withdrawing them to hardware wallets, bitcoin would become significantly more fungible, and blockchain forensics companies would suffer a major blow. Even if you can’t be motivated to mix your coins for the greater good, do it for your own. Services such as Cashshuffle for BCH make it easier than ever to obfuscate the origin of your coins, while Coinjoin, incorporated into pro-privacy wallets like Wasabi, do the same for BTC.

There’s something extremely comfortable about having a stash of cryptocurrency that can’t be linked to your identity safely stored in a hardware wallet that’s been backed up. It’s the digital equivalent of having a backyard bunker filled with canned goods and ammo in readiness for the apocalypse. Treat yourself to a privacy makeover and see how good it feels.

The exchange posted a notice on its website saying that as of Tuesday it is no longer operating, adding that users will need to withdraw any funds held on its platform by April 30. The fees for withdrawals and the minimum threshold have been lowered to assist the process, it said.

While the notice was vague as to the reasons for the closure, a Coinnest official told CoinDesk Korea:

“It is a natural result of a decrease in trading volume. Both regulatory issues and business decisions have served as a background for this decision.”

The decision comes after a bad year for the exchange. A year ago an executive of the firm was arrested on suspicion of fraud and was later convicted, receiving a jail sentence and a 3 billion Korean won ($2.5 million) fine.

However, another official at Coinnest played down the connection with the company’s closure when speaking to CoinDesk Korea.

Coinnest also lost $5 million in a mistaken airdrop this January. The firm revealed at the time that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were sent to customers due to a computer error. The exchange had been trying to distribute We Game Tokens (WGT) when the incident occurred.

The publication calculated the sum by looking at a filing to Britain’s corporate registry last week showing Coinbase’s non-U.S. revenue equaled around 154 million euros ($173 million), noting that a Coinbase executive once stated that the non-U.S. revenue is equal to almost one third of the overall revenue

Based on Reuters’ calculations of Coinbase’s 2018 revenue, the crypto exchange has generated 60% less than its stated plans.

In late October 2018, Bloomberg published an article claiming that Coinbase had projected that it would see $1.3 billion in revenue in 2018. Based on unspecified documents, Bloomberg wrote that the San Francisco-based crypto exchange foresaw significant revenue from commissions on trades, as well as from gains and losses in its crypto holdings, despite the bear market.

In January 2018, industry sources reported that Coinbase made about $1 billion in revenue in 2017, overshooting its forecast for that year by 66 percent.

The Cointelegraph team has not found any official data from Coinbase about its revenue for either 2017 or 2018.

This article has been updated to specify that SBI Holdings has made an announcement about the delisting of BCH, and not mentioned listing BSV.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) — the altcoin that emerged during the bitcoin cash (BCH) hard fork last November and which took the moniker “Satoshi’s vision” — has been on the periphery of crypto news this week. BSV is famously backed by Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, chief scientist at his startup called nChain and self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto.

After Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, decided to delist BSV amid Wright’s campaign to deanonymize one of his critics, other major platforms — including ShapeShift and Kraken — followed suit.

As a result, the price of BSV tanked. Meanwhile, Wright and his team have purportedly served some of their critics with court documents, demanding public apologies.

#WeAreAllHodlonaut: How Wright has enraged the crypto community

The delisting marathon was preceded by Craig Wright’s run-in with an anonymous Twitter personality nicknamed Hodlonaut, who also organized the Lightning Torch campaign. According to crypto news outlet Coingeek (founded by billionaire Calvin Ayre, who has been vocal about his support for BSV), Hodlonaut targeted the Australian businessman with offensive tweets, calling him “a very sad and pathetic scammer. Clearly mentally ill,” and allegedly participating in the creation of the #CraigWrightIsAFraud hashtag.

While Craig Wright has repeatedly claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, much of the cryptocurrency community seems skeptical about those statements, widely referring to Wright as “faketoshi.” Back in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported that the Australian computer scientist might be the creator of bitcoin (BTC), but a substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports — both of which cited an anonymous source who had contacted them voluntarily — was soon proved false. Wired subsequently assumed that Wright “was likely pulling an elaborate hoax or con” to present himself as Satoshi to the public.

On April 11, Coingeek went as far as to set a $5,000 bounty in BSV for information regarding the true identity of Hodlnaut, while also demanding that the Twitter user should publicly apologize to Wright both on the social media platform and during an open court hearing. The article contained informal language, alleged pictures of Hodlonaut, his or her approximate location, and explicitly called for deanonymization:

“Wright is demanding that the individual behind the @Hodlonaut account tweet an apology to him, make a statement in open court apologizing to Wright and acknowledge the falsity of the allegations made against Wright. Instead, Hodlonaut seems to have hidden under his mother’s skirt and is nowhere to be found.”

Hodlonaut has since deleted his or her Twitter account. In response, the cryptocurrency community on Twitter began trending a #WeAreAllHodlonaut hashtag to show support. Moreover, an eponymous website was created to crowdfund BTC in order to help Hodlonaut fund his or her legal battle with Wright. According to the information posted on the website, the pseudonymous Twitter user had received a letter from Wright’s legal team before erasing his or her online presence. In it, Wright’s lawyers were allegedly threatening to sue Hodlonaut for defamation in a United Kingdom court (as per Wright’s LinkedIn profile, the Australian entrepreneur currently resides in London. According to earlier reports, he lived in Sydney, and local police had raided his house).

As of press time, more than $28,700 has been raised via weareallhodlonaut.com, which is more than 140% of the initial goal of $20,000. The website states that Hodlonaut personally controls the funds from this campaign and that any excess contributions will be sent to Bitcoin Venezuela, the same charity-focused organization that received donations from the Lightning Torch campaign.

Cointelegraph has reached out to Preston Byrne, an attorney at Byrne & Storm and who claims be to handling Hodlonaut’s case pro bono, but he declined to comment.

Notably, earlier in March of this year, not long before erasing his presence on Twitter himself, Wright tweeted that he will be “taking action aggressively to remove any site that is in error or makes false claims,” referring to people calling him a fraud, among other things.

“You do not have a right to lies under ‘free speech’ nor harassment, nor libel and slander,” he wrote. “If an error is reported in a malicious context concerning me, expect to be living in a barrel when we finish with you.”

Peter McCormack, the host of the podcast “What Bitcoin Did,” is another person who has reportedly been approached by Wright’s legal team. According to McCormack’s tweets, after he tagged Calvin Ayre’s account to declare that Wright is a fraud and provided his personal address in Bedford, U.K. for legal correspondence, he allegedly received a letter from SCA Ontier LLP, a London-based law firm. In it, like in the case of Hodlonaut, he was asked to publicly apologize to Wright both on Twitter and in court.

Moreover, Wright’s attorney reportedly stated that his client “has not fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto” since his client allegedly is Satoshi Nakamoto. The statement further claims that Wright wrote bitcoin’s original white paper, sent the first bitcoin transaction and played an integral role in the network’s development.

McCormack then shared what he calls his “formal response,” where he declined to apologize to Wright and asked him to provide evidence that would confirm that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. On April 18, McCormack was allegedly served with a service claim for 100,000 British pounds (around $130,000).

Seamus Andrew, managing partner at SCA ONTIER LLP, has verified to Cointelegraph that his firm represents Craig Wright and that they are in the process of taking legal action, but did not specify whether or not they were suing McCormack or Hodlonaut.

“I confirm that we act for Craig Wright, and that we are in the process of bringing legal proceedings against certain individuals and entities who have defamed our client,” Andrew said via email.

Cointelegraph has requested for a comment from McCormack to clarify the details of his case, however, as of press time, he has not replied.

Binance, ShapeShift, Kraken and other platforms have delisted BSV

The situation escalated on April 11, when Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binace — currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trade volume — warned that he would delist BSV (which trades under the ticker BCHSV on the platform) if the creator of the altcoin — i.e., Craig Wright — does not correct his behavior. The tweet seemed like a reaction to Wright’s action against Hodlnaut:

“Craig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist!”

The community reacted to Zhao’s warning by asking various exchanges to delist BSV and by kick-starting a #DelistBSV hashtag.

On April 15, Binance officially announced that it will delist BSV. Specifically, the exchange stated that, as of April 22, it will delist the altcoin and cease trading all of its trading pairs. In the accompanying statement, Binance explained that it regularly reviews assets listed on its platform “to ensure that it [the asset] continues to meet the high level of standard we expect.” The firm went on to explain that it only delists a coin after a second in-depth review, noting, “We believe this best protects all of our users.”

Thus, the exchange listed the responsiveness to its due diligence requests, the level and quality of the coin’s development, as well as “evidence of unethical / fraudulent conduct” among the factors that it takes into account before delisting a cryptocurrency.

Later, on April 15, anonymous exchange ShapeShift and crypto data supplier and cryptocurrency wallet Blockchain.com also announced they were dropping BSV. On Twitter, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees confirmed that the company came to a decision to stop listing the altcoin for reasons similar to those of Binance:

“We stand with @binance and CZ's sentiments. We’ve decided to delist Bitcoin SV #BSV from @ShapeShift_io within 48 hrs.”

Other crypto platforms took a slightly different approach, letting their users decide whether to delist or keep BSV via Twitter polls. For instance, instant crypto exchange service ChangeNow wrote:

“As a service strongly disagree with Craig Stephen Wright's policies and business decisions - everything, really.

However, we believe that the @BitcoinSVNode community should not suffer because of some decisions one man made.

So, do you think we should #DelistBSV? $BSV #BSV”

Similarly, major United States crypto exchange Kraken has decided to delist BSV following the results of a Twitter poll. In the official press release, the platform said that BSV had “engaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for.”

BSV price had tanked as much as 20% following the series of delisting announcements, according to data obtained from CoinMarketCap, but currently shows signs of a slight recovery. As of press time, it is trading around $60, gaining back around 5% during the past few days.

Notably, the delisting announcements drew a negative response from some community members. “I have no love for bsv but I also take no joy in seeing a biased, bot infested platform like twitter being used to shut coins down with the impression they are democratic votes on a unbiased platform,” a Redditor wrote on the r/btc subreddit.

“Delisting bitcoin SV from some of the popular exchanges certainly was harmful to the project,” Matthew Greenspan, eToro senior market analyst, told Cointelegraph over Skype after a warning that it was difficult for him to comment on the case since he knew Hodlonaut and participated in the Lightning Torch experiment.

“I would say it was a slap to bitcoin SV and its founders. […] Some of their opinions and threats have been extremely unpopular in the crypto community,” he said. “Now it will be harder for people to buy and sell it [BSV], and it will be harder for it to gain real liquidity in the market.” Greenspan also added that the results of the polls held by Kraken and other crypto platforms are “self-evident.”

Wright’s company, nChain, which designed bitcoin SV and is responsible for its technical development, has denounced the #DelistBSV campaign. “The sudden delisting of Bitcoin SV by some exchange is absolutely unjustifiable and sets a terrible precedent for the cryptocurrency industry,” Jimmy Nguyen, the chairman of nChain, told Cointelegraph.

According to Nguyen, the BSV network became much stronger after Binance, Kraken and other exchanges listed it on their platforms after November’s hard fork of the BCH network. Since then, more mining pools, wallets, applications and services have begun working with BSV, nChain’s chairman added, while the daily average block size of BSV was increased as well, showing technical development of the altcoin. “Therefore, there is even more reason to list BSV, not delist it,” Nguyen argued.

“The delisting decision is driven by personal dislike of Craig Wright and retaliation for steps Craig has taken to pursue personal legal rights against people he believes are defaming him,” Nguyen said. That, according to him, is a menacing sign for the community:

“A dangerous precedent has been set if an exchange uses its CEO’s personal dislike of a coin’s individual supporter as the reason to make delisting decisions. What if one day Vitalik Buterin took personal actions that offended an exchange CEO? Should that be the basis to delist Ethereum?” Nguyen asked. “Whether you agree with Craig Wright’s personal legal actions or not, Craig’s invoking of legal remedies are for a court of law to decide — not crypto exchanges.”

The nChain chairman also criticized the idea of using Twitter polls to decide whether to delist BSV, calling it “ridiculous.” He went on, saying:

“It’s not hard to imagine the Twitter polls are just providing cover for a delisting decision already made. Twitter polls are not even limited to the exchanges’ customers, can be easily manipulated by bots and multiple anonymous accounts, and create the climate for mob rule. I expect regulators around the world to take a critical look at this Twitter poll charade.”

When asked whether he condones Wright’s behavior, Nguyen repiled:

“Like every person, Craig is entitled to invoke whatever legal rights are available to him, and let the legal system decide. He is defending himself after years of cyber bullying. Craig now simply wants a court of law, rather than the Twitter-sphere or exchange CEOs, to decide.”

Alternative measures: Some platforms kept BSV or even delisted BCH instead for political reasons

Some crypto platforms deliberately chose not to follow suit and left BSV on their platforms. Thus, on April 16, OKEx, a massive cryptocurrency exchange that is currently ranked the number one exchange on CoinMarketCap based on adjusted trading volume, announced that it decided not to delist Wright’s controversial cryptocurrency after conducting “a rigorous review on BSV in terms of technology development, liquidity, and compliance.” The exchange wrote:

“According to the OKEx Token Delisting and Hiding Guideline, BSV currently does not meet our delisting criteria. As such, OKEx has no intention to delist BSV for the time being.

“As a neutral platform, OKEx respects the efforts of all dedicated teams in advancing the technology of Bitcoin and has no inclination to certain technical directions.”

Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings went even further and declared it will delist BCH from its virtual currency exchange in June 2019.

As per the original statement on the matter, SBI Holdings delisted BCH because of “a significant decrease in the market capitalization” and a “high possibility” of a 51% attack.

“If so [SBI Holdings delisting BCH while keeping BSV], it would be quite funny for them to delist Bitcoin Cash ABC [BCH] due to the possibility of a 51% attack and not to delist other coins,” market analyst Matthew Greenspan told Cointelegraph. “If you look at crypto51.app it shows you that a possibility of a 51% attack and Bitcoin Cash ABC is very low on that list, even lower than Ethereum… and Bitcoin SV is at the 5%.”

Notably, as Cointelegraph Japan reported, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and representative director of SBI Holdings, has a connection with the BSV founder, with Wright having revealed their close relationship in a tweet in January, demonstrating that he and Kitao spent time together and claiming that he treats Kitao as “a friend and man I respect a lot.”

Regardless of what happens next, the latest BSV drama has showcased the power that the community has over the market. Greenspan agrees with that statement. “Historically, we can see that community has an incredible influence over the technology and the paths that crypto takes,” he said. “Satoshi Nakamoto also predicted this as he spoke about hard forks and splits of the network. His sentiment was basically that the stronger fork or network will always survive whereas the lesser fork will be in deep trouble and we can see that clearly here.”",,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-44-ytd-gain-crypto-bull-market-imminent/,"

Bitcoin has gained nearly 50% of its value since the turn of 2019 to stroke the flames of the next crypto bull rally. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: Year-to-date, the bitcoin price has increased by 44 percent against the U.S. dollar from $3,700 to $5,320, becoming one of the best-performing assets in the global market alongside oil.

The initial 20 percent rally from bitcoin in early April from $4,200 to $5,000 drastically changed the sentiment around the crypto market and investors generally expected bitcoin and the rest of the market to slow down following a strong upside movement.

In the past few days, bitcoin has continued to increase in value, surpassing $5,300 to record a 32 percent increase in price within one month.

The momentum of bitcoin as well as the significant rise of Binance Coin (BNB), the seventh most valuable cryptocurrency in the market, led the valuation of the crypto market to surge by around $70 billion since February.

Can Binance Coin Improve Sentiment Around Crypto?

Since January, in less than four months, Binance Coin (BNB) has surged by 322 percent against the U.S. dollar, becoming the first cryptocurrency to break its all-time high since 2017.

Some traders have suggested that the rally of Binance Coin, triggered by the highly anticipated launch of Binance Chain, may fuel the recovery of alternative cryptocurrencies.

Previously, the rise in the price of Ethereum (ETH) to $1,500 led to an increase in demand for ERC20 tokens and alternative cryptocurrencies at the height of the 2017 bull market.

“Thinking if BNB could trigger the new altcoin bull run as ETH did in the past,” one recognized trader said.

While reports have shown that an unexpectedly large number of institutional investors have invested in the crypto market in the past 12 months, the impact of the inflow of institutional capital into the crypto market remains uncertain.

It is more likely that funds that are already in the crypto market sitting on the sidelines in the form of stablecoins, hedge funds, and fiat on exchanges would have a larger effect on the short-term performance of the market.

Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, previously said:

Theres an estimated $2 billion in cash sitting at crypto funds/holdcos. Theres another $2 billion+ sitting in stablecoins, and another $2 billion sitting at exchanges/silvergate/signature. This is $6 billion fiat already onboarded to crypto to buy your bags. Imagine thinking we need new money to hit $10k.

If existing capital in the crypto market begins to move back into the market due to improving sentiment, it may allow the market to recover last year’s losses.

Will Binance Coin Change the Landscape of Alternative Cryptocurrencies?

Speaking to CCN.com in an exclusive interview, the Binance team said that it encourages projects that do not rely on smart contracts to migrate to Binance Chain in the near-term.

Several projects including Mithril have already moved to Binance Chain.

The Binance team explained:

Binance Chain was created to support the issuance and exchange of digital assets. Any project can issue new tokens on Binance Chain, and existing tokens that don’t depend on smart contracts are welcome to migrate to Binance Chain, to natively exchange on Binance DEX and gain the benefits from this low latency and high throughput network. This will inspire more economic freedom, and more projects participating in Binance DEX will help further the long-term vision of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading.

Whether the entrance of Binance Chain in the high throughput blockchain space would be sufficient to change the landscape of tokens is too early to determine, but based on the interest of the market around it, the expectations of investors that Binance could play a key role in the next upside movement of the market can be justified.

Cryptocurrency is now an official issue in the US presidential election.

You're probably most familiar with cryptocurrency by way of bitcoin, which soared in value in 2017 then mostly collapsed in 2018. But the technology spreads far beyond that, and presidential candidate Andrew Yang says now's the time for clearer government rules to encourage its development in the US.

Yang, a tech entrepreneur and now one of at least 18 Democratic challengers to Donald Trump, is far from the frontrunner for an election that's still a year and a half away. But the fact that he's weighing in at all shows that cryptocurrency and related technology, like blockchain, isn't just an obsession of crypto-anarchists who want a high-tech alternative to a safe full of Krugerrands.

If Yang gets his way, cryptocurrencies could become more useful and move beyond early problems like initial coin offering (ICO) scams and criminal payment uses. Maybe they'll even be something you use in your daily life.

Today's rules, including federal and some state laws, have had ""a chilling effect on the US digital asset market,"" and laws haven't kept up with cryptocurrency developments, Yang said in policy paper published Thursday. ""Uncertainty in what regulatory framework will develop is causing US investment in the area to lag behind the investment of other countries.""

Now playing: Watch this: Presidential candidate Andrew Yang talks geo-engineering,...

Cryptocurrencies are far more complicated than the rise and fall of bitcoin. People have mostly treated them as assets to invest or speculate in. Cryptocurrencies can also serve a purpose similar to plain old money used to buy and sell things, or to store value.

The accounting mechanism behind cryptocurrencies, called blockchain, can be used for all sorts of record keeping, like the sale of houses or the tracking of inventory. ""The blockchain has vast potential,"" Yang wrote.

Yang: Not every crypto asset is a security

Yang argues that US regulations must differentiate between cryptocurrencies used as money and cryptocurrencies used as securities, like company stock, that you can invest in. He also calls for consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions, as well as simpler tax rules for buying and selling digital assets.

Today, the IRS treats cryptocurrency largely as a security. If you buy some cryptocurrency and it rises in value, you have to pay tax on any profits you make when you sell it. That tax treatment is at odds with the idea that cryptocurrency can function as money.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

Though Yang shows a certain enthusiasm for cryptocurrency issues, at least compared with his Democratic rivals, that doesn't mean everybody in the cryptocurrency world is a fan. One person's clear regulation and consumer protection is another person's government meddling.

For example, one person in Reddit's cryptocurrency forum assessed Yang's cryptocurrency proposal as an effort to ""tax it to oblivion"" and require us to report all past and current cryptocurrency holdings to the IRS.

Andrew Yang, cryptocurrency candidate

Yang had already staked out a claim as the cryptocurrency candidate in his 2018 announcement, in which he said he'd accept donations in bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. The process isn't simple, though, and requires ""a 15-minute phone call with a member of the compliance team.""

Meanwhile, Yang also would like to see the US get rid of a financial instrument he sees as obsolete: the penny.

Jesse Orrall/CNET

""It costs more to make a penny than it is worth,"" which means taxpayers have to pay $70 million a year, Yang argues. ""Getting rid of them will save us money and time. Good for the environment too.""

Yang, the son of an IBM researcher and university systems administrator, is a techno-savvy candidate. In an interview at CNET in March, Yang discussed everything from drones to deplatforming people on social media to Trump's Space Force. Among other technology related stances in his policy positions, Yang wants to:

It'll be difficult to finding political consensus on any of those issues, much less to win an election on them. But as the digital revolution spreads to every corner of our lives, expect more politicians to acquire Yang's taste for tech.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/these-next-generation-mining-rigs-pack-a-ton-of-hashpower/,"These Next-Generation Mining Rigs Pack a Ton of Hashpower

Last week, mining manufacturer Bitmain launched its latest Antminer 17 series. Now Canaan Creative has published its own device specifications and pricing for the new Avalonminer 10 series that process between 31-33 trillion hashes per second (TH/s). In addition to Canaan’s latest miners, two more China-based companies are releasing next-generation miners this summer that mine at maximum hashrates between 46-70TH/s.

Avalonminer 10 Series: 31-33 Trillion Hashes per Second

Bitcoin mining machines that process the SHA256 consensus algorithm are growing ever more efficient. Last year, a number of newly improved mining rigs were released by various manufacturers and this year there’s a bunch more on the horizon. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on Bitmain and Canaan’s new miners but Canaan hadn’t published the latest Avalonminer 10 specifications or prices. The new Avalonminer 10 series documentation is now available on the company’s website and interested buyers can sign up for the waiting list.

There are two models available on Canaan’s store – the Avalonminer 1041 and the 1041F. Interestingly, even though one unit is a bit more effective than the other, they are both listed for the same price at $1,057 per mining rig. The 1041 unit processes the SHA256 algorithm at 31TH/s and power efficiency of 56 joules per terahash (J/TH). Another thing to note is that the 10 series models both use 16nm chipsets rather than the next-generation 10nm or 7nm chips used by competitors.

In addition to the chips used, the 1041 machine puts out 70 decibels (dB) of sound and weighs around 8kg. The more effective Avalonminer model, the 1041F, processes 33.5TH/s according to the 1041F specifications page. Canaan says the 1041F comes with top tier power efficiency by giving owners 63J/TH. The machine is a touch lighter at 6kg and also puts out 70db sound which Canaan calls a “traditional” output. Each machine has a 180-day warranty from when the mining rigs are received.

Strongu’s U8 Model: 46 Trillion Hashes per Second

In addition to the latest mining rigs being sold in 2019, the top three mining giants Ebang, Bitmain and Canaan have smaller competitors trying to make strides in the industry. Two models being sold this summer aim to give miners higher hashrate for their money. The first mining rig expected to go on sale this July is Strongu Mining’s STU-8 (also known as the U8) which claims to pack a maximum hashrate of 46TH/s. The model’s power consumption takes about 2100W off the wall according to specifications. A few vendors online expect the U8 model to sell between $1,520-1,883 per unit. The U8 is a bit louder too as the unit’s fan has a noise level of around 76dB. The U8 model will be sold in pre-sale batches as well (25 units per order) according to the Strongu website. However, the China-based firm does not disclose what type of chipset is used for the latest U8 model.

Microbt Whatsminer M20S: 70 Trillion Hashes per Second

Another mining rig expected this summer stems from another company headquartered in China. The manufacturer Microbt claims the new Whatsminer M20S will process a maximum hashrate of around 70TH/s. The machine has a power consumption of around 3360W and has a noise level of around 75dB. Microbt plans to sell the mining rig in August and the rig’s official distributor Pangolin is selling each unit for $2,349. The Pangolin website does disclose the type of chip used in the new M20S models, revealing it to be a 12nm TSMC made semiconductor.

Despite the crypto winter, bitcoin mining manufacturers have continued to develop faster models with next-generation chips. Both BTC and BCH hashrates have risen significantly in 2019 and global data shows the mining economy is still booming. It’s likely that next-generation machines will relentlessly push the envelope within this industry. With the Microbt Whatsminer M20S, Strongu’s U8, and the new Antminer 17s from Bitmain producing hashrates of over 50 trillion hashes per second, mining competitiveness is guaranteed to increase. Soon enough, mining participants and facilities will find that low hashrate-producing mining rigs will be far less efficient to the point of not being worthwhile to run, unless they’re combined in great numbers.

Binance Coin has had a stellar performance since the beginning of 2019. Up more than 315 percent since January 1. BNB has managed to surpass its former all-time high values from January 12th, 2018.

The First to Breach Former USD ATH

As Bitcoinist reported earlier this week, Binance Coin is one of the top performing cryptocurrencies, having a breakout year against Bitcoin.

BNB 00 continues its surge not only against BTC, but also against the US dollar. The cryptocurrency managed to become the first one to soar past its former ATH value against the USD which was achieved back in January 2018 – right around the peak of 2017’s historic bull-run. Back then, BNB was trading at $24.46.

Against BTC, Binance Coin is also doing splendidly, again surging to another ATH.

At the time of this writing, BNB is up around 13 percent in the last 24 hours alone.

Reasons For BNB’s Surge

It’s safe to say that there is more than just one reason for BNB’s strong performance throughout 2019. So let’s take a look at a few of them.

Utility

Binance Coin’s main purpose was to allow traders to receive significant discounts on trading fees when using BNB to pay for them.

According to the official whitepaper, those who use BNB to pay their fees will receive a 50 percent discount in the first year, 25 percent in the second year, 12.5 percent in the 3rd year, and 6.75 percent in the fourth year. This applies to exchange fees, withdraw fees, listing fees, and any other fees on Binance.

BNB Burning

The initial supply of BNB was set to 200 million. However, the Malta-based exchange has said that it will be destroying the BNB equivalent of 20 percent of their quarterly profits until 50 percent of all coins are burned, leaving just 100 million BNB in circulation.

So far, there have been 7 quarterly burns, which have removed a total of 10,677,344 BNB from circulation.

Initial Exchange Offerings

Binance was also the first cryptocurrency exchange to begin conducting initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Essentially, these are fundraising events where the exchange is selecting a certain project, issuing tokens through a dedicated platform and listing them immediately for trade once the IEO has finished.

The catch, however, is that you can only use the exchange’s native token to participate. Hence, those who wish to buy in an IEOs conducted by Binance would have to first buy BNB. Even more so, Binance has implemented a new rule which requires those who wish to participate to hold BNB for a minimum of 20 days prior to the event.

So far, Binance Launchpad has completed four IEOs, each one of which has ended in a few seconds with thousands of people lining up to take part.

Binance Chain

Another major development around Binance has been the recent launch of its mainnet for the decentralized exchange Binance Chain.

It created a serious hype in the cryptocurrency community, especially as every crypto that’s migrating to Binance Chain is pumping in price.

Changpeng Zhao

Community sentiment surely plays a role in the price of cryptocurrencies and it’s safe to say that the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is amongst the most prominent individuals out there.

Not only is he constantly outlining the achievements of Binance, as well as those of other projects which attribute to the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies, he also manages to appeal to many in the space. This became even more so after he came through with his promise that Binance would delist Bitcoin SV following the ongoing feud between Craig Wright and certain members of the community.

The above are just some of the reasons for the strong performance of BNB. However, with the Binance Chain token swap incoming in a few days, it’s interesting to see whether BNB will maintain its steady course upwards.

Is BNB leading the next market bull-run? Let us know in the comments below!

On Dec. 1, 2018, however, Cointelegraph reported that the Thai SEC declared Thai-related security token offerings (STOs) in international markets to be illegal and said that it will take appropriate legal action against companies that attempt to distribute STOs created in Thailand to overseas markets.

Tipsuda Thavaramara, the deputy secretary of the Thai SEC, reportedly said:

“The regulator will have to consider how to deal with STOs for issues such as share ownership, voting rights and dividend. At the moment, we have not decided whether STOs fall under the SEC Act or the Digital Asset Act, but it depends on the STO's conditions and the details in its white paper.”

The government’s initial stance toward the approval of STOs in the local market contradicted the Thai SEC’s plans to legalize ICOs and allow companies to raise capital from investors in the public market.

This month, the Thai SEC reportedly approved the launch of the country’s first ICO portal, with plans to approve an ICO project in the near future.

Archari Suppiroj, the director of the fintech department at the SEC, said that the launch of the ICO portal could lead to the approval of STOs in the local market:

“The next step is for an issuer to offer security tokens in the primary market.”

Importance of STOs on foreign investment

Andreessen Horowitz, billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and several more major venture capital firms have funded security token projects throughout the past year, betting largely on the value security tokens with high liquidity and fungibility can bring.

Josh Stein, the CEO of Harbor, which raised $28 million from Andreessen Horowitz, said that no major regulators and government agencies that the company has engaged in discussions with in the past several months have expressed a negative sentiment toward well-structured security tokens.

He said that, primarily because STOs are strictly regulated investment vehicles that are fully compliant with local regulations, governments are generally open toward regulating the security token market.

Placing an emphasis on the absence of legal boundaries between STOs and global financial regulations, Stein said:

“There’s a misconception that there’s a regulatory problem or that somehow the regulations need to change. They don’t. You need to comply with rules around the world. If the compliance doesn’t work, nothing else can happen. We have talked with a number of regulators in the U.S. and around the world. No one has given us negative feedback and no one has signed off on it, but our fundamental opinion is that we’re complying with the rules.”

Assets that are represented by STOs are real-world assets that are tangible and can be approved by the authorities. Security tokens merely offer a cryptographic representation and a proof of ownership, which, as a result, increase the liquidity and fungibility of the physical asset.

Traditional assets, like properties and artwork, can be represented by tokens using a cryptographically encrypted blockchain network, allowing investors to obtain ownership of certain assets by purchasing tokens.

Security tokens enable investors to purchase a portion of an asset without having the pressure of wholly acquiring it. One of the major reasons cryptocurrencies have appealed to millennials since early 2017 is the ability for young investors to invest a small amount in digital assets. With real estate and many other physical assets, it is not possible to do so.

Even when security tokens are utilized in complex deals, it is possible for the issuer to freeze trading on a certain security token asset upon the request of the government and move back to paper. While it leads to administrative expenses and reputational exposure, the government and the security token operator can cooperate to create a physical version of the security token if an issue were to arise.

With no major regulatory boundaries and with significant benefits in liquidity, fungibility and transportability, investors that have been involved in the traditional financial sector — like Hong Joon-ki, the CEO of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency exchange Cumberland Korea — have said that, eventually, various assets like artwork, real estate, sports teams and hedge funds will be tokenized:

“The global cryptocurrency sector will rapidly change to security tokens at an exponential rate. Venture funds, hedge funds, sports teams, artworks, real estate, and a variety of real world assets will be tokenized on the blockchain. Currently, the majority of financial institutions entering the cryptocurrency sector with the backing of institutional investors are driven by the potential of tokenized assets and security tokens. These institutions are expanding their operations rapidly by working with cryptocurrency researchers and blockchain technology startups.”

State of Thai regulation

Despite the shifting trend toward security tokens and the rising interest in tokenized assets in the global market, the current regulatory landscape of Thailand’s cryptocurrency market was nowhere close to permitting the distribution of regulated security tokens less than three months ago.

In July, the Thai SEC officially legalized registered ICOs, allowing companies to run token sales with guidance from the SEC. At the time, the Bangkok Post reported:

“The SEC will allow seven cryptocurrencies, used for initial coin offerings (ICOs), to be traded as trading pairs. They are bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, litecoin, ripple, and stellar. [...] All market participants, including ICO issuers, digital exchanges, brokers and dealers involved with digital asset transactions, are required to register with the SEC within 90 days of the effective date. [...] The participants must also receive the Finance Ministry’s approval to conduct digital asset business.”

The implementation of a new policy regarding the legalization of regulated and registered ICO projects portrayed the willingness of the Thai government to facilitate the growth of local cryptocurrency startups, as long as their operations are in compliance with existing regulations.

More importantly, the decision of the Thailand SEC to facilitate the needs of blockchain projects to conduct ICOs showed the intent of the government to help lay the groundwork for ICO and STO projects in the future.

Conceptually, security tokens are similar to registered ICOs in the sense that both are cryptographically encrypted assets that operate under the guidance of the Thai SEC, given that only registered companies that meet the SEC’s criteria can run a token sale and that the sale is limited to accredited investors.

The open-minded approach toward ICO by the Thai government may translate to optimism toward security tokens, particularly because security tokens pose less threats to investors in the public market and to the government, since the authorities can exercise relatively strong control over security tokens.

Based on the policies the Thai government has implemented since early 2018, the roadmap of the government seems to be to address every major problem from the ground up, beginning with the basics.

In May, the Thai authorities waived a 7% taxation rate for individual cryptocurrency investors, relieving pressure from investors who invest through local digital asset trading platforms. In the following month, the Thai SEC released a framework for legalizing registered ICOs. Then, in August, the government approved seven cryptocurrency companies to operate legally in the country, officially giving them the ability to sustain their operations without facing banking- and regulation-related issues.

If the government determines that basic issues in the cryptocurrency exchange market, ICO market, and taxation are addressed and sufficient investor protection is imposed, then the government could shift its attention to emerging sectors within the broader cryptocurrency space, including security tokens.

Overall, Thailand is continuing to see some progress and changes in the local market in terms of regulation, adoption and growth. Merely eight months ago, ICOs were completely banned in Thailand, registered or not.

With the G-20’s lead on cryptocurrency regulation, Thailand and other regions in Asia are expected to regulate their respective digital asset markets with stricter policies, and as a result, the Thai government could eventually get to security tokens in the long term.

But, in the near term, it is fairly unlikely that the Thai government will allow retail investors or individual investors to be involved in security tokens as of yet, especially during a period in which the United States, Japan and South Korea have yet to make any major move to adopt security tokens.

China’s ban on STOs

On Dec. 1, less than 24 hours after Thailand issued a warning against security tokens, China imposed a blanket ban on security token offerings.

Huo Xuewen, chief of Beijing’s Municipal Bureau of Finance, said in a roughly translated statement:

“The ICO model is being left behind for a new concept called STO. I want to issue a warning to anyone considering running an STO in Beijing. Don’t do it in Beijing — it is illegal. You can only engage in such activities with approval from the government. You will be kicked out if you do it.”

Seven days following the release of Xuewen’s statement, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) officially imposed a blanket ban on security tokens.

At an internet finance forum in Beijing, Pang Gongsheng, the deputy governor at PBoC, explicitly described that the act of offering security tokens is illegal under existing laws in China. A rough translation of Pang’s statement reads:

“The STO business that has surfaced recently is still essentially an illegal financial activity in China. […] Virtual money has become an accomplice to all kinds of illegal and criminal activities.”

China has firmly opposed security tokens because of the country’s strict capital controls and laws that make it difficult for foreign investors to purchase properties in the country. The purpose of a security token is to increase the fungibility and transportability of a physical asset. Only China-based companies operated by Chinese individuals can purchase properties, and as such, security tokens in China offer less benefits.

The value security tokens could bring to Thailand

Although foreigners are not allowed to purchase land in Thailand, they are allowed to purchase apartments and condominiums, and obtain long leases for land.

For a foreign citizen to purchase a condominium in Thailand, regardless of the value of the property, minimal paperwork is needed to prove the investor’s identity.

For such deals, security tokens could simplify the process of settling payments and proving ownership through a digital piece of evidence that can also exist in a physical form.

Throughout 2018, Thailand has not been as aggressive as other major economies in Asia — such as Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea — in appealing to cryptocurrency startups and bringing in talent for its blockchain sector. With practical regulatory frameworks in place and by allowing the creation of a new industry in security tokens, Thailand could obtain an edge over the rest of the cryptocurrency sector in Asia.

For now, Thailand and its financial authorities may not be ready to properly legalize the distribution of tokenized assets — at least to foreigners — and based on various factors, security token offerings will likely remain restricted in the near term. But, in the long term, Thailand may move toward supporting STOs, as hinted by Thai SEC Director Archari Suppiroj.

But, as Cointelegraph reported on April 5, the Thai government supported a blockchain-based remittance service provider, expressing its intention on facilitating the growth of blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related businesses.",,https://www.coindesk.com/the-hidden-effects-of-crypto-money-laundering-rules,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team.

Ever since Emperor Vespasian held up a gold coin that came from taxing urine and pointed out that it smelt just as clean as others, the separation of money from its origin has been on regulators’ minds.

The accelerating flows of digital money around the world, as well as the rising threat of terror attacks and powerful crime cartels, have given the dialogue an added urgency and resulted in a flurry of rules and guidelines from national governments and supra-national organizations.

Obviously, these were, at some stage, going to affect cryptocurrencies given the concern of many authorities that bypassing third parties would make it much harder to stem the flows of illicit funds.

Exhibit A: AMLD5, a Europe-wide law that will end up affecting crypto businesses around the world. Recent signs from other jurisdictions also point to increased attention around this issue. As usual with encroaching compliance regulation, the short-term pain in terms of higher costs and lower privacy is a concern, and there are signs that regulators still don’t fully understand how the technology works.

But longer-term, even the most onerous requirements will end up evolving and are likely to stimulate sector development in unexpected ways.

Now my watch begins*

(*pardon the Game of Thrones quotes, I couldn’t resist)

First, some background.

In June of 2018, the European Parliament and Council published an update to the bloc’s anti-money laundering (AML) directive. Known as AMLD5, the deadline for its implementation is January 2020, less than a year away.

Under the new rules, all crypto exchanges and wallet custodians operating in Europe will have to implement strict know-your-customer (KYC) onboarding procedures and will need to register with local authorities. They will also be required to monitor transactions and to report suspicious activity to the relevant bodies.

Furthermore, national authorities, including tax collectors, will be able to obtain crypto user information from the relevant exchanges.

The concern about illicit transfers is not just limited to Europe. Last week US-based crypto exchange Bittrex was denied a BitLicense due to KYC and AML shortfalls in its onboarding procedures (an assessment the exchange rejects).

On a broader scale, in December of last year, leaders from the G20 nations reiterated their pledge to develop comprehensive AML rules for cryptoassets. And the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body set up in 1989 to tackle money laundering, is due to publish guidelines and enforcement expectations for crypto exchanges around the world by June of this year.

Fear cuts deeper than swords

A draft of the FATF proposals was released in February. In a comment published last week, cryptoanalytics firm Chainalysis responded to this draft, pointing out that it is not always possible to know the beneficiary’s details, and in most instances an exchange does even not know if the destination is an exchange wallet or a personal one.

The EU Commission, on the other hand, seems to be aware of this and has been mandated to present, by early 2022, a further set of amendment proposals concerning self-reporting by virtual currency owners, and the maintaining by member states of central databases with users’ identities and wallet addresses. You can imagine the pushback that this will get.

Some of the more vocal objections to the encroaching oversight point out that it defeats the purpose of cryptocurrencies, which were designed to circumvent control by central authorities and avoid the risk of censorship.

Others have expressed concern that these rules will divert transactions to the less transparent crypto-to-crypto and/or decentralized exchanges that fall outside the scope of AMLD5.

And there’s the business risk, too: Operating expenses are a worry for any project, and the growing burden of reporting requirements could slow down the growth and professionalization of market infrastructure.

Make it your strength

Yet while the concerns are valid, the intensifying AML attention is more likely to help rather than harm the sector.

First, the AMLD5 enshrines in law what is probably the first “official” definition of virtual currency: “a digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority, is not necessarily attached to a legally established currency and does not possess a legal status of currency or money, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange and which can be transferred, stored and traded electronically.”

The use of the phrase “means of exchange” could end up giving entrepreneurs and lawyers support from which to construct further innovation, and regulators a base from which to develop more detailed definitions.

Another plus is the likely increase in banks’ confidence when dealing with crypto exchanges. One of the main reasons virtual currency businesses have such a hard time getting bank accounts is the financial institutions’ concern over money laundering allegations. Remove those, and the greater operational ease that comes with having access to a banking network is likely to encourage further infrastructure growth and development. This in turn could enhance the sector’s reputation and liquidity, as well as make market prices less volatile.

It could also pave the way for eventual custody by traditional financial institutions of cryptocurrencies themselves, which would further enhance demand for cryptocurrencies for both transactional and investment purposes.

Wear it like armour

A growth in the liquidity of cryptocurrencies will boost more than their price: It will also boost interest in and feasibility of using the underlying technology for tracking purposes.

As Chainalysis pointed out in its FATF comment, an effective use of blockchain technology would make it much harder to launder money using cryptocurrencies than digital fiat money, and would enable market participants to simultaneously collaborate with law enforcement while complying with trends in privacy legislation.

Sharing a wallet address with market participants in other jurisdictions is not the same as sharing personally identifying information and does not trigger infringements of Europe’s stringent privacy laws. This would make it easier for law enforcement to monitor and investigate suspicious activity, while protecting user privacy until a determination is made that more information is needed.

What’s more, the transaction history preserved on public blockchains gives greater credibility to data integrity and protects evidence from manipulation or human error. With blockchain-based assets, prosecutors could have access to a much deeper data trail than with fiat currencies. And a long enough time horizon, combined with sophisticated analytics, should provide a more holistic view of patterns, enabling enforcement officials to develop preemptive strategies that could further reduce the cost burden of the surveillance.

With this, we may even enter a world in which regulators see cryptocurrencies as the “cleaner” option. This could encourage them to recommend their adoption for money transfers across borders, instead of focusing on erecting barriers to their use. This could also lead to more official support for innovation around money, even from central banks, which in turn would accelerate the transformation of the banking industry as we know it.

Indeed, what is seen by many as crypto’s greatest threat could end up being its greatest opportunity.

Until recently, Bitmex, Deribit and a handful of established exchanges were the only places where traders could get their leverage fix. This has now changed with the emergence of dozens of exchanges offering leverage and plenty more on their way. Binance and Kucoin – two platforms famed for driving this year’s other exchange trend, the IEO – are believed to be mulling the introduction of margin trading. In 2019, it seems, everything’s being served with leverage.

Margin Trading Is so Hot Right Now

Margin trading and initial exchange offerings (IEOs) have proven to be the dominant trends among cryptocurrency exchanges this year. Bibox is the perfect case in point: the exchange, which offers up to 3x leverage on BTC, recently entered the IEO game, announcing the launch of no less than four projects on Bibox Orbit simultaneously to commence on April 22: The Force Protocol (FOR), Ludos (LUD), Staking (SKR), and X-Block (IX).

FTX is another platform that encapsulates one of 2019’s defining crypto exchange trends, in this case for leverage. The derivatives exchange, backed by trading firm Alameda Research, offers futures, leveraged tokens at up to 3x, and OTC trading. With leverage of anywhere from 2-100x, these exchanges multiply the thrill – and the risk – of going long or short on bitcoin and other digital assets. Where once traders had a handful of options, now there are dozens, as the number of platforms offering margin and derivatives products has proliferated.

The Perils of Offering Leverage

On market data sites such as Coincodex, Coinlore, and Coinpaprika, the number of exchanges offering leverage now runs to more than 50. Some provide margin trading on leading coins such as BTC, ETH, and BCH, while others have gotten more adventurous, offering products such as leveraged futures on Telegram’s still unreleased gram token. For traders lured by the prospect of tripling their money through little more than cranking up a slider and letting the multiplier effect take care of the rest, there are a few perils to be aware of – aside from the obvious risk of being liquidated.

Bitmex takes pride in the size of its insurance fund, which currently stands at close to 24,000 BTC, but the majority of leveraged exchanges aren’t nearly so well equipped. With smaller exchanges, a large trader’s account going bankrupt can lead to clawbacks from other accounts to cover the loss. Poorly designed risk management systems exacerbate this risk. The complexities of offering leverage are significant, necessitating collateral to be posted for separate margin wallets for each digital asset. Newly launched futures exchanges also typically suffer from low volume and poor liquidity due to a small customer base, which in turn makes it more difficult to attract customer flow and market makers.

It’s not just new exchanges that can get things from when it comes to managing margin, either: last year Okex suffered a $9M clawback after a trader placed a large BTC order and was then liquidated after the asset crashed. As FTX notes, “If a user has a leveraged futures position on and markets move against their account enough that their net asset value is negative, then someone has to pay for that loss.” It continues:

In crypto you can’t repossess assets from the bankrupt account’s owner from outside the system, so you’re stuck with other users — the users who aren’t getting liquidated — footing the bill.

With the public’s appetite for leveraged everything and IEOs for everything showing no signs of being sated, expect to see plenty more of both in 2019. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, with hundreds of platforms jostling to gain a foothold, margin, despite its hazards, is seen as a key way to attract traders and stay relevant.

Yes, most by now understand that it is the original Bitcoin following the original design, protocol and vision of Satoshi Nakamoto based on the white paper and other sources. Most everyone smart also by now agrees that Craig Wright is the inventor of Bitcoin.

However, the distraction caused by the endless trolling and cyberbullying of Craig and his legal efforts to stop them are not what is important. What is important is to understand the different between Bitcoin SV and all other copycat platforms and why they are all so scared of Bitcoin SV.

Binance and a cartel of these altcoin-dependent exchanges just launched a delist attack on Bitcoin SV under the guise of it being about Dr. Craig Wright. I am sure the young and inexperienced leaders of Binance and the cartel think this is smart. It is not.

They are right that Bitcoin SV is an existential threat for them all. Bitcoin SV is designed to be the “power everything” platform, and can scale to do everything that all other blockchain and DLT projects claim to do and far, far more. It can power Internet of Things Dr. Craig Wright’s greater vision of the Metanet, where Bitcoin SV subsumes and powers the entire Internet and monetizing all data.

This means that if Dr. Wright’s vision comes to pass, the world will operate on a single global blockchain, just like we operate on a single public internet. There will be no other public blockchains or cryptocurrencies, and the only tokens other than BSV itself will be financial and other real world assets tokenized on top of BSV.

The Bitcoin SV vision also means that the future of crypto exchanges will change. Currently, exchanges list far too many tokens in order to inflate fee revenue from trading as many cryptocurrencies as possible and generating casino-like fervor. This model will come to an end. The future is the model of FloatSV, a newly-launched and BSV-focused exchange. As stated on its website, FloatSV “only supports tokenized real assets” and does so “by committing to list only blockchains running Proof of Work SHA256 and real assets such as commodities and currencies.” The casino style speculative exchanges without banking will ultimately cease to exist.

This is the real reason Binance and some other exchanges are afraid of Bitcoin SV, and why they illegally banded together to try to incite a mob mentality on social media to harm Bitcoin SV. Craig’s legal actions to defend himself from trolling was just the excuse they choose to justify this. That and his prior social media conduct when Craig is not even on Twitter anymore.

But this is the amazing part. None of these youngsters in this cartel understand that Bitcoin SV does not need the casino-style exchange to succeed. We are building a blockchain that has real utility for businesses and consumers, to enable massive amounts of real payment and data transactions, to support the BSV token with real long-term value. Therefore, its “use case” is not trading against other cryptocurrencies to make money, like the speculative investment scheme for most other tokens. It is a utility platform for the BSV token to actually be used on BSV blockchain, so it only needs fiat on and off ramps. At some point, the BSV ecosystem will also need regulated secondary markets for security and commodity tokens of real world assets, such as FloatSV is anticipating. But at no point in its life does Bitcoin SV’s ecosystem need casino-style speculative exchanges for trading against large numbers of coins that are not real assets. Bitcoin SV is a utility backbone to run everything and this makes it unique as no other blockchain platform has this plan or ability.

This means that in launching this attack, all these exchange guys have done is sped up the inevitable march of regulation over their actions. This was coming anyway as on June 19th, 2018, the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5) was published in the official journal of the European Union. Among other things, the EU Directive extends all the traditional anti-money laundering laws to virtual currency platforms and wallet providers. I can’t wait for this Directive to be implemented in all EU countries. I’m sure the crypto exchange landscape will quickly change.

Meanwhile, all Bitcoin SV needs is to finish restoring the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable and keep massively scaling. If it does that, big enterprises will come build on BSV what they cannot do on other platforms, and BSV will consume – by its superior technology – the entire crypto ecosystem of the world. This is Dr. Craig Wright’s vision and that is why it really does not matter who invented Bitcoin, because he sure as hell invented Bitcoin SV and in doing this he has changed the world for the better.",2019-04-21,https://cointelegraph.com/news/everything-but-crypto-or-how-the-crypto-movie-does-not-live-up-to-its-name,"Edward Zuckerman is a journalist and an Emmy-winning television writer.

The best news for crypto enthusiasts about the movie “Crypto” is that “Crypto” has very little to do with crypto. It is mainly concerned with Russian mafiosi, money laundering and a main character who plods through the heavy plot with the affect of a depressed zombie.

Cryptocurrencies do make three appearances in the movie:

1. It is revealed that a major bank, because (one character explains) such banks are terrified of being made irrelevant by cryptocurrencies, is secretly buying crypto in order to drive the price up, on the theory that high prices will make cryptocurrencies unaffordable and dissuade people from buying them. I am not sure this makes sense, since I was under the impression that rising prices make cryptocurrencies not less but more attractive to the general public (hence the bitcoin buying frenzy at $20,000). But this is not a major plot point.

2. The Russian mob, which is laundering money through that same bank, is doing some of its laundering by the use of crypto. The details of this are vague, but it is apparently being done in league with one of the bank’s employees, so #2 may be linked to #1 above. Or maybe not.

3. One major character — who owns a failing discount liquor store — is making a lot of money by investing in initial coin offerings. He is also mining crypto with a computer set-up in his store’s back room. It’s that easy!

All of this is explored, or stumbled upon, by the film’s main character, Martin Duran, played by Beau Knapp. Martin is allegedly a top-ranked business school graduate who has a fairly mundane job as a compliance officer for the major bank. After he angers the bank’s brass by nixing a proposed big client, he is punished by being transferred to the bank’s branch in his own home town, a small farming community. Although many scenes are set in that bank branch (which does not look like a bank), no customers ever appear. Regardless, Martin’s new job as the branch’s compliance officer involves a specific brief to keep an eye out for money laundering. I was not aware that individual bank branches had compliance officers, but never mind.

Martin’s attention is soon drawn to a high-end art gallery where pictures sell for millions of dollars. (We are told the town has a newly gentrified section, although we never see any of the gentry.) The women working at the gallery find Martin attractive, which is among the film’s least likely plot turns. Martin is a thin, sallow fellow who speaks in a low monotone and sports traces of what might or might not be an attempted beard. (Even a casual viewer may have the urge to tackle him to the ground and administer a shave.) He also wears the same dark suit, black tie and dress shoes in every scene, even when he is hiking through the woods on a date with an attractive gallery assistant played by Alexis Bledel (former star of “Gilmore Girls,” who deserves better). She suggests he wear more appropriate shoes next time.

The gallery’s finances are suspicious, and indeed the place is linked to the Russian mob, represented locally by Vincent Kartheiser (of “Mad Men” fame, who ditto). The mob gets wind that Martin, with the help of his friend — the failing liquor store owner, who also happens to be a genius hacker — is looking into its affairs. The mob disapproves. Kartheiser gets his revenge by out-acting Knapp (Martin). Also there is mayhem and violence.

A parallel story involves Martin Duran’s family, from which Martin has been estranged. His brother (played by Luke Hemsworth), a damaged Iraq war veteran, is no happier to see Martin than we are. His widowed farmer father, played by Kurt Russell in one of the grimiest t-shirts ever seen onscreen, is gruff but affecting and seems to harbor the wish that his boys will reconcile.

In the end (spoiler alert!), they do. And all is well. Martin departs the depravities of Wall Street to return to the family farm, where he helps his father and brother dig up potatoes. Martin and his brother smile for the first time in the film. And Martin sets up a crypto mining operation in a home office.

The exchange announced on its corporate website on Friday that, as of Monday, April 22, the firm will have signed over its business to publicly listed Japanese investment firm Fisco and full operations will be reinstated Tuesday.

The plan for the takeover was first aired in October 2018, and sees the exchange pass from its previous owner, Tech Bureau, to an existing crypto exchange owned Fisco. Friday’s post indicates that the deal cost Fisco 5 billion Japanese yen ($44.675 million).

In its September 2018 hack, Zaif lost approximately 7 billion yen ($62.5 million) in the bitcoin (BTC), monacoin (MONA) and bitcoin cash (BCH) cryptocurrencies.

Since then, Zaif said Friday, registration of new members has been suspended, while trading, depositing and withdrawing MONA has been on hold since October 10, 2018. As of tomorrow, those services will be reinstated.

As pledged previously, the exchange has now refunded users that lost holdings in the breach. The firm explained that holders of BTC and BCH were refunded in their original cryptocurrency, but, due to liquidity issues with the token, MONA holders received about 60 percent in the crypto and the remainder in Japanese yen for compensation at a rate of 144.548 yen per MONA.

As reported last November, cybersecurity experts at Japan Digital Design, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), working in conjunction with other security firms, said they had found possibly revealing information on the Zaif hackers.

After investigating the outflow of monacoin from the exchange soon after the hack, Japan Digital Design said it was able to identify the “source” of the attackers. While the details of the findings were not disclosed, the team said it had shared this information with the authorities.

Crypto payment processing startup Moon announced today that any lightning-enabled wallet can now also be used through Moon’s browser extension. Before this lightning feature, roughly 250 beta users already used Moon to spend crypto on e-commerce sites by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase.

Moon CEO Ken Kruger told CoinDesk:

“[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.”

To be clear, Amazon itself never touches bitcoin. Kruger declined to specify which traditional financial institutions are helping convert the bitcoin to fiat on the backend so that Amazon merchants actually receive fiat currency for their wares. However, Kruger added that by 2020 the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site, regardless of whether that platform accepts bitcoin directly.

“There’s no direct merchant integration,” Kruger said, clarifying that Moon also manages payment channels and merely offers a simple interface for sending payments.

“We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction,” he said.

Moon was founded in New York last year and grew to a staff of three people with just $100,000 invested by the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. The accelerator’s managing director, Murat Aktihanoglu, told CoinDesk he sees Moon as one of the “anchor” crypto businesses with lucrative potential over the next five years.

“We invested in Moon as a long-term portfolio company,” Aktihanoglu said.

In the meantime, Kruger said his startup is looking to raise a Series A in 2019 and continue learning from user behavior.

“There’s a lot of opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems and getting people onto the lightning network, increasing adoption in that way,” Kruger said. “We’re going to engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps. We’d love to step in and help whenever possible.”

UPDATE (April 22, 14:10 UTC): The extension’s lightning network functionality is still being reviewed by the Chrome Web Store and is now anticipated to launch on Wednesday, according to Moon.

According to the founder of Airdrop Venezuela, the charity that aims to donate US$1 million worth of cryptocurrencies to Venezuelans, the nonprofit has registered 60,000 beneficiaries and raised $292,000 in donations so far. Moreover, bitcoin cash (BCH) has led the pack as far as the most donations are concerned with roughly 670 BCH ($194,900) gifted to date.

Airdrop Venezuela Gathers 60,000 Beneficiaries and Close to $300K in Digital Donations

During the end of 2018, a cryptocurrency fundraiser was initiated to help citizens of the crisis-stricken South American nation of Venezuela. The charitable effort, dubbed Airdrop Venezuela, was created by the digital currency startup Airtm, a nonprofit that aims to raise $1 million in digital assets for Venezuelans. The leader of the campaign, economics professor Steve Hanke, announced during an interview on April 21 that the project has more than 60,000 registered beneficiaries and has raised $292,000 since the launch.

The humanitarian aid campaign hopes to onboard Venezuelans into the world of cryptocurrencies. The Airdrop Venezuela project started on Nov. 27, 2018, and has continued to raise money for Venezuelans in need for the last few months. Hanke explained this past weekend that the main reason for the venture is to provide citizens with economic freedom.

“There’s really no particular political motivation. It’s just to help people to give them some purchasing power — The money comes from private donations,” Hanke explained during his interview. The economist added:

[Airdrop Venezuela] will be a demonstration of how relief agencies all around the world can easily deliver aid and relief to people in need.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Donations Capture the Lead by a Landslide

The beneficiaries of the fundraiser will be a total of 100,000 ID-authenticated Venezuelans and the funds donated, no matter which cryptocurrencies they are, can be quickly converted to dollars. Since the crowdfunding started, donors have been able to send bitcoin cash, airtm, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin core, zcash, dash, dai, komodo, and a few other coins. During his discussion, Hanke said the method used to fundraise eliminates inefficient donation schemes like “driving a pickup truck around filled with cash that you’re giving away or filled with medicine or clothing or food.” Hanke revealed that beneficiaries can simply use the Airtm platform to exchange the cryptos for U.S. dollars and use the proceeds to buy food, medicine, and other necessary supplies.

“When the currency in your country is literally melting in your hand and — knowing that, the key is getting people hard currency that they can actually use to purchase something — So that was the general attraction,” Hanke stressed. “And the technology of using this internet platform is just what the doctor ordered.”

According to the Airdrop Venezuela website, the most donated cryptocurrency by far is bitcoin cash (BCH). In addition to 670 BCH donated, other leading cryptocurrency donations include airtm, bitcoin core, zcash, dai, and ethereum. When the project distributes the funds to registered Venezuelans, the cryptos will be donated on a weekly basis to recipient Airtm wallets. Hanke noted this method of donating funds is not only more efficient but a “very safe way” to distribute money to individuals who need it most.

At 04:00 UTC, the world’s premier cryptocurrency, whose market capitalization accounts for more than half of all other cryptocurrencies combined, picked up a bid and saw its price climb as high as $5,650 in less than 10 minutes on April 23 – its highest price since Nov. 18, 2018.

At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price has since pulled back slightly, now trading across exchanges at an average price of $5,586, according to CoinDesk’s price data.

Also up roughly 1.48 percent on the day, bitcoin’s individual market capitalization rose to its highest value since mid-November, $96.9 billion, while its percent share of the broader cryptocurrency market, also known as its “dominance rate,” is currently at 53.2 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.

CoinMarketCap data also reveals the cryptocurrency’s exchange trade volume reached 15 billion in the last 24 hours, yet those figures may be misleading as suggested by a recent report from asset management firm Bitwise, which identified 95 percent of the reported trading volume on CoinMarketCap to be fake, with only 10 exchanges reporting honest figures.

These 10 exchanges combined, which include the likes Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp and more, reported $1.7 billion worth of total bitcoin trading volume in 24-hours, according to Messari.io.

Generally accompanied by a strong move in bitcoin’s price are similar movements in the USD value of most other cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, the broader market is flashing green today with nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap rank reporting gains above two percent, the strongest performer of which, Cardano (ADA), is now up 9.71 percent on the day, CoinDesk data shows.

In all, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market increased roughly 6.3 billion during today’s rally and now stands at $184.3 million, down roughly 78.2 percent from it’s all-time high of $835 billion achieved on January 7, 2018.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

Is cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s delisting of bitcoin SV a form of censorship?

And if so, doesn’t that make hypocrites out of all the Bitcoin Core supporters and Craig S. Wright haters who cheered the downgrading of the latter’s competing bitcoin project? Are they not applying a double standard by simultaneously arguing for immutable, “censorship-resistant” blockchains?

These are the questions bitcoin skeptics are putting to a cryptocurrency community they view as failing to comply with the Voltairean maxim that one should fight for someone’s right to say something regardless of whether you agree with it. (Yes, I know it wasn’t actually Voltaire who said that…)

Whether this “gotcha” is fair or not, it has given rise to a far more interesting crypto debate than the tiresome, yearlong squabble between Craig Wright-supporting BSV holders and Craig Wright-loathing BTC holders, the one that triggered the delisting in the first place. (Before Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, made his decision, BTC supporters had pressured him to punish Wright for filing defamation lawsuits against Twitter accounts that had refuted the bitcoin SV founder’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.)

A popcorn-worthy debate

It’s not all that clear who’s winning this debate. If anything, it has provided a reminder that the words used by both blockchain utopians and their hard-nosed realist critics often fail to adequately capture the nuances of what’s happening in the crypto ecosystem or, for that matter, in the wider world of social media and online communities.

The bitcoin critics’ main point is compelling. It’s that a decision to delist BSV cannot be about whether CSW is a jerk (there is almost universal consensus that the Australian “Faketoshi” meets that characterization). Jerks should not be censored just for being jerks, and doing so contradicts the Cypherpunk ideal of censorship-resistance to which many bitcoin believers subscribe.

(Full disclosure: Craig Wright blocked me on Twitter for using the j-word against him – this from his @ProfFaustus account, which, intriguingly, appears to have been deleted in recent days.)

As I munched on my popcorn, I found myself sympathizing with the ever-astute Angela Walch, a constant, formidable critic of blockchain advocates’ sweeping, hand-wavy claims to the magic of “decentralization.”

In a stage-setting tweetstorm, Walch pointed out that the cheerleading for Binance’s move exposed the “cognitive dissonance in what the space claims to be about.”

Do I have this right…one guy thinks what another guy said is not true so says no one can trade a censorship-resistant, decentralized digital asset on the first guy’s exchange. #crypto #blockchain #veilofdecentralization — Angela Walch (@angela_walch) April 15, 2019

But then, along came investor Ari Paul, who gave the whole thing a different context.

You see, Paul said, the standard of censorship resistance does not extend to private entities that provide services on top of open systems, much as Binance does with the bitcoin protocol and those of other blockchains. These private agents are free to deal with their clients as they wish.

1/ Freedom of speech is a value near and dear to my heart, so it’s frustrating seeing people misuse “censorship” and conflate radically different cases. It’s not censorship for Amtrak to have a quiet rail car. Let’s explore Binance/BSV: — Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul) April 16, 2019

That seemed fair enough too. It accurately distinguished between the decentralized rule-setting of each system’s underlying blockchain – the layer to which the aspiration for censorship-resistance applies – and the centralized entities that access it.

And on that basis, Paul’s point matched how U.S. courts approach First Amendment lawsuits. To preserve free enterprise, courts routinely allow privately-owned entities to pick and choose whom they deal with and what information they publish, whereas they will curtail government entities’ efforts to restrict the speech of private citizens and businesses.

Similarly, we could argue that a price-quoting and trade-executing crypto exchange whose business decisions occur off-chain isn’t subject to the rigid, quasi-constitutional on-chain rules for equitable treatment that govern the decentralized network running a blockchain’s publishing protocol.

An exchange can refuse the prices and transactions of whomever it pleases. Doing so does not compromise the integrity of the free-speech/anti-censorship standards of the underlying blockchain’s governance system.

Holding the big guys to account

The problem is there are countless different blockchains. And within that environment, exchanges such as Binance don’t so much operate an application (i.e. run a private business) and subject it to a single blockchain’s governance system, but rather service the needs of people moving across those systems.

Using the same constitutional analogy, they are flag-less shippers carrying information across borders; they aren’t jurisdictionally bound by any one government.

In playing this role, cryptocurrency exchanges aren’t executing the censorship-resistant rules of a blockchain but, as the on- and off-ramps between different blockchains’ assets, they are nonetheless vital to the functioning of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.

That’s why critics like Walch are rightly highlighting their actions. So far, exchanges represent pretty much the only proven business use-case in this space. They are the cryptocurrency industry. Surely, they should be held to high standards of neutrality.

Comparisons can be drawn to the debate over “deplatforming” on Twitter, Facebook and other social media entities. On the one hand, these can be viewed as private entities free to censor whomever they like.

On the other, because of their giant networks, the public naturally wants to hold them to a different standard. Given the enormous role they play in our communication system, there’s a strong case for regulating their publication decisions, much as governments regulate public electricity or water utilities.

Due to its size, Binance could be characterized as the cryptocurrency equivalent of a dominant social media network. Just as being banned from Twitter and Facebook can seriously hurt the economic performance of a social media influencer, so too can a Binance delisting seriously hurt the value of a crypto token.

The role of regulation

That brings us to another analogy proffered by critics of Binance’s actions. Imagine the outcry, some said, if leaders of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – both integral to a functioning capital market ecosystem – suspended trading in a company because they didn’t like the comments of its CEO. The point: Binance should be held to similar standards of impartiality.

But the comparison is imperfect. The NYSE and Nasdaq, as well as countless other formal stock exchanges around the world, frequently delist companies for reasons of wrongdoing. It’s just that they apply a highly regulated framework when doing so.

Take a look at the most up-to-date list of “issues pending suspension or delisting” at Nasdaq and you’ll see that the reason many companies are on that list is, very often, one of “regulatory/non-compliance” issues.

In other words, whatever “censorship” decisions that sophisticated, traditional exchanges make tend to occur on the basis of rules set by an external governance system.

In the U.S., it’s an interconnected hierarchy that includes exchange members; self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Industry (FINRA); the exchange’s own internal compliance teams and oversight boards; various bodies of legislation; and external enforcement agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Now consider a thought for CZ. He was under enormous pressure from both sides of the BTC vs. BSV fight to decide what he felt would best serve his and the industry’s long-term interests. But he did so without a set of external rules to refer to. If he had one, he could more comfortably have argued that his hands were tied.

I don’t expect CZ to call for more regulation. But the fact is that regulation, by externalizing the listing rules criteria, would, at least in these kinds of matters, help crypto exchanges manage their public image.

It might be tempting to believe these are just temporary problems because new decentralized exchange models will let clients maintain custody of their assets and independently execute their trades. But execution isn’t the main reason we depend on exchanges; it’s that, as centralized hubs, they bring many buyers and sellers together in one place, enabling effective price discovery.

The harsh reality is that, until someone achieves the extremely difficult goal of creating an effective, fully open-source trade-matching and price-discovery algorithm running on an entirely decentralized network, cryptocurrency ecosystems will depend upon the network effects that these necessarily centralized entities generate. And that’s why consistent listing standards, and the question of how to enforce them, matter.

In the absence of consistent, externally enforced rules, it’s perhaps unfair to hold Binance – a centralized entity, not a miner in a blockchain – to a “censorship-resistance” standard. CZ had to make a decision amid the chaotic hurly-burly of a boisterous community. By the same token, we can perhaps excuse the seemingly hypocritical stances of many BTC investors who supported that decision.

But that should not stop users from demanding that crypto exchanges establish and adhere to more consistent standards and rules. A company of such size and influence over the crypto ecosystem must be held to account – a standard no different from what we should demand of banks in the fiat ecosystem.

This, and not the tortured discussion over what “censorship” means, is the most important lesson to take from the latest bout of crypto agita stirred up by my Aussie compatriot.

Censorship image via Shutterstock",2019-04-22 08:00:24+00:00,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/22/bitcoin-hacker-sentenced-to-10-years-in-first-ever-conviction-for-sim-swap-scheme/,"SAN JOSE — A Boston-area resident has been sentenced to a decade in a California prison in what is believed to be the country’s first-ever arrest and conviction for “SIM swapping,” commandeering victims’ smartphones to steal millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.

Joel Ortiz, 21, was sentenced Friday after pleading no contest in January to eight counts of identity theft and computer crimes. He was originally charged with 41 counts and linked to 13 identified victims; the plea involved agreeing to pay restitution to the eight who suffered some monetary loss.

Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Erin West, whose office runs the South Bay-based Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team that handled the case, credited the team — which includes Sheriff’s Office detectives — with being on the forefront of high-stakes financial tech crime.

“I’m very proud that the Santa Clara County courts were able to recognize the significance of this crime and the complete devastation in which it leaves the victims,” West said. “It’s under-reported and under-investigated, but it’s a major threat to our country’s financial security.”

All told, authorities believe Ortiz stole more than $7.5 million in digital cryptocurrency — including $5.2 million from a Cupertino cryptocurrency entrepreneur — from upward of 40 victims, though the charges and conviction reflect just a portion of those figures.

“Ten years should send a strong message to would-be hackers that Santa Clara County will not tolerate crime,” West said.

In SIM swapping, hackers get a mobile phone carrier to transfer access to a targeted person’s phone number from the registered SIM card to one of theirs. Some cases involve internal sabotage — like having a connection at a phone carrier — though many digital intruders answered security questions by combing through a person’s social media profile, or through phishing emails and chain-style Facebook posts. Having access to text messages allows someone to bypass most digital security barriers to banking, social media and cryptocurrency accounts.

REACT investigators first got onto Ortiz’s trail in February 2018 when a Santa Clara County resident suspected he was the victim of such a scheme, and eventually discovered that he had lost $10,000 worth of bitcoin. Within a few days, the presumed hacker called the victim’s wife and sent text messages to his daughter including the message “TELL YOUR DAD TO GIVE US BITCOIN.”

That led to detectives tracing the hacker’s SIM and smartphones used to access the man’s accounts, and found emails that identified Ortiz, including a photo of him holding his Massachusetts ID card. That led to the discovery of at least $1.5 million in activity. Several of the victims linked to Ortiz attended the same May 2018 cryptocurrency conference in New York.

Online, Ortiz flaunted a lavish lifestyle presumably funded by the stolen funds that included designer clothing and posh mansion rentals in Los Angeles, where he was arrested July 12 while trying to fly out of LAX.

Since Ortiz’s arrest, the REACT task force has made other notable SIM swap arrests, including in August of 19-year-old Tracy resident Xzavyer Narvaez, who was reportedly implicated by emails found on one of Ortiz’s phones.

Kansas City resident Joseph Harris was arrested by REACT in Oklahoma City in September and later charged with stealing $14 million worth of cryptocurrency tokens from the San Jose-based tech firm Crowd Machine. New York City resident Nicholas Truglia, 21, was arrested in Manhattan in November and implicated in at least 11 SIM swap cases, with victims including a San Francisco man who lost $1 million in digital funds he had saved for his daughters’ college education, and a Cupertino resident.

Kalvin Ung was arrested Dec. 20 in Fresno and later charged with a SIM swap ploy targeting 12 victims for a total loss of $500,000, after a Bay Area resident reported a cryptocurrency theft last fall. The cases of Narvaez, Harris, Truglia and Ung are in various stages of prosecution, with Ung being the furthest along with a preliminary examination hearing scheduled in May.

In Ortiz’s case, only about $400,000 has been recovered, with the rest either believed to be spent or otherwise unaccounted for.",2019-04-22,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-koreans-invest-an-average-6-000-in-cryptocurrency-says-new-survey,"More South Koreans are buying cryptocurrency than ever before and spending more fiat to do so, local daily news network Arirang Daily News reported April 20.

Referencing the results of a December 2018 survey from nonprofit organization the Korea Financial Investors Protection Foundation, Arirang revealed 7.4% of the 2,500 adults surveyed said they had bought cryptocurrency.

That figure was up 1% on the year before, despite the industry facing hurdles locally in the form of shifting regulation and various exchange hacks.

Not only the number of purchasers had changed: out of those who now owned crypto, many were buying more of it than before.

Compared to 2017, the average investment per person shot up 64% to over $6,000, Arirang said.

According to the survey, it was older investors who were the most common crypto buyers — those in their 50s, followed by 30-40-year-olds.

As Cointelegraph reported, bitcoin’s (BTC) price uptick to $5,300 at the start of April has spurred the reemergence of a bullish trend peculiar to the South Korean market.

Williams took to the social media platform late last week to announce her VC firm Serena Ventures – which was secretly founded in 2014 – and listing some of its investments, including Coinbase and startups in areas such as fitness, clothing, food and women’s health and community.

Williams said in the post:

“In 2014, (yes I know I can keep a secret) I launched Serena Ventures with the mission of giving opportunities to founders across an array of industries. Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity.”

The Serena Ventures website states that the company’s portfolio includes over 30 firms with a total market capitalization of $12 billion. It is not clear how much was invested by her VC firm in Coinbase or in which round(s).

According to Crunchbase, Coinbase has seen investments totaling $546.6 million since its seed round in 2012. It most notably raised $300 million in a Series E round in October 2018, valuing the firm at $8 billion.

Forbes indicates that, in 2018, Williams became the highest paid female athlete globally for the third year in a row, with earnings of around $18 million. She also has her own line of clothing and accessories.

As an athlete, Williams has achieved won a world record 23 Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era. She’s also achieved 14 Grand Slam doubles titles alongside her sister Venus, and won four gold medals at the Olympics.

The Coinbase investment may not be such a surprise, as Williams’ husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, was an early backer of the exchange through his venture capital firm, Initialized Capital.

Disney has reportedly been offered a controlling stake in NXC, the parent company of South Korean video game publisher Nexon, which specializes in online games for PC and mobile. Nexon is the biggest game developer in South Korea and is the world’s second-largest online games market. NXC owns two major cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg, and Korbit, based in South Korea.

Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is the world’s longest-running Bitcoin exchange.

According to a report by Korea Herald, Jung-ju met with a representative at Disney, offering to sell his stake in NXC to the entertainment giant.

Billionaire and NXC chairman, Jung-ju Kim, is selling the 98.64% stake that he and his wife hold in NXC, which owns 47.02% of Nexon. He has been trying to sell his stake since January with final bids set to take place on May 15.

Says Jung-Ju,

“What I envy the most about Disney is that they do not force money out of kids … (consumers) gladly pay Disney. Nexon has a long way to go. Some people hate Nexon to death.”

Last year NXC subsidiary NXMH, a Belgian-based investment group, acquired Bitstamp, one of the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges by volume in the European Union. It supports major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and XRP, and fiat-crypto pairs in US dollars and euro.

Bitstamp currently has a 24-hour trading volume of $56.7 billion, according to data compiled by CoinMarketCap, with BTC/USD comprising 57.12% of its daily volume, valued at $32.4 billion. Bitstamp is among crypto researh firm Messari’s “Real 10 Volumes”, one of 10 select crypto exchanges, along with Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and Gemini, that are used to track what it considers to be legitimate volumes.

NXC also owns a majority stake in rival crypto exchange Korbit through its subsidiary. Nexon acquired 65% of Korbit in 2017 – the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea and the first Bitcoin exchange in the country. Korbit has a daily trading volume of roughly $9.8 billion, at time of writing.

Reuters reports that NXC is also fielding bids from Chinese gaming giant Tencent, South Korean internet giant Kakao and a few private equity firms including Bain Capital, MBK Partners and KKR.

Bitcoin’s daily chart is reporting a “golden crossover” – a bull cross of the 50- and 200-day moving averages – for the first time since October 2015. The crossover represents a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

A convincing close today above $5,466 (April 10 high) would establish another bullish higher high and boost the prospects of a rally to $6,000.

That rally, however, may be preceded by consolidation or price pullback, as the golden crossover is accompanied by the overbought readings on the relative strength index and a neutral long/short ratio.

The case for a pullback to $5,000 would strengthen if the price fails to close (UTC) today above $5,466 (April 10 high).

With bitcoin’s (BTC) move to five-month highs Tuesday, a notable bull cross of key moving averages has formed for the first time in nearly four years.

The crypto market leader jumped to $5,627 on Bitstamp earlier today – the highest level since Nov. 18 – having revived the short-term bullish case with a repeated defense of key support at $5,170 last week.

Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed the 200-day MA from below, confirming a long-term bullish pattern known as a “golden crossover” in technical parlance. This is the first golden crossover since October 28, 2015. Many analysts consider the indicator an advanced warning of stronger price gains in the long term.

The crossover, however, is based on moving averages, which are backward-looking in nature. For instance, the 50-day MA is based on 1.5-month old data, while the 200-day MA responds to more than six-month-old price action.

Hence, the indicator is more a confirmation of the recent bull run, rather than a signal of further price gains.

That said, the investor community may take heart from the fact that bitcoin’s previous bull market began just two days after the golden crossover in 2015.

Daily charts 2015/2019: Golden crossover confirmed

As can be seen (above left), the 50-day MA last crossed the 200-day MA from below on Oct. 28, 2015, and prices confirmed a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later.

The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017.

This time round, the confirmation of the golden crossover has been preceded by the violation of the bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2.

While there is a reason to be optimistic, the golden crossover lags price, as discussed earlier. Further, it tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-term if the market is looking overbought, which looks to be the case currently.

RSI and Long/short ratio

The cryptocurrency’s move to five-month highs has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 70 – a sign of overbought conditions. Hence, a price pullback cannot be ruled out in the short term.

Supporting that argument is bitcoin’s long/short ratio, which has shed the bullish bias. The ratio of BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex (right) is currently hovering just below 1.00 – the lowest level since early January – having printed a high of 1.53 on April 8.

The sharp decline indicates the sentiment has turned from bullish to neutral over the last 15 days. Note that a reading well below 1.00 indicates a bearish bias, while an above-1.00 print represents a bullish market.

Daily chart: UTC close is key

A close above the April 10 high of $5,466 would establish another bullish higher high and strengthen the case for a rally toward $6,000.

However, with the golden crossover accompanied by the overbought readings on the RSI, as well as a bullish-to-neutral shift in the long/short ratio, prices may fail to close above $5,466 or the bullish close could be short-lived.

The odds of a fallback to $5,000 would rise if today’s candle ends in the red well below $5,466, validating the lower high (bearish divergence) of the RSI.

While Bitcoin is more bullish than it’s been since its all-time high of $20,000 back in December 2017, altcoins, which had been experiencing massive gains in price over the last few months, have suddenly turned extremely bearish.

Across social media, crypto analysts are issuing warnings on how to handle altcoin investments in the face of renewed bearish sentiment, and offer insight into what this means for the rest of the crypto market.

Bitcoin Price Rally Causes Altcoins To Bleed Out

While Bitcoin’s first large movement through resistance at $4,200 that resulted in a nearly $1,000 upward movement over the course of an hour brought altcoins along with it for the ride, this most recent move has caused an increasing amount of bearish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s crypto cousins.

Many altcoins are still posting small percentage gains across the board in USD value, though nearly the entire market in value relative to Bitcoin has sank considerably. Any alts that only have a trading pair with BTC were hit exceptionally hard. Nano, Tezos, and a few other outliers managed to grow in relation to BTC value, however the rest of the market is a sea of red.

The good thing about alts nuking is that the next alt season is going to be that much sweeter.

Just let them go down 30-50% more and then stuff your bags and you'll be just fine for the next round.

On top of that as long as they nuke holding BTC longs is way comfier. — DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) April 23, 2019

One particular crypto analyst, DonAlt, in a tweet hinted at the downside potential for altcoins as falling as much as “30-50%” as Bitcoin rallies further. The trader says that alts “nuking” is a “good thing” as it’ll make the next alt season “that much sweeter.”

Some altcoins, such as Ethereum and Ripple, have underperformed relative to Bitcoin over the last few months. If Ripple fell another 30-50% from here, it’d set new bear market lows, as Bitcoin enters what could be the start of a bull run.

Altcoins: Switching from BTFD to STFB Mode

Another prominent trader has recommended that crypto investors cease “buying the dip” across altcoins, and instead suggests that traders sell each bounce at support.

In an EOS chart accompanying the tweet, support is clearly shown as being broken. And each time support broke previously on the chart, resulted in a deep decline for EOS. While the exact price action won’t play out across all altcoins, many charts do appear similar in structure, and often the entire altcoin market moves in parity.

For a few weeks there, crypto analysts were watching Bitcoin dominance for a break below 50% which could have sparked an all-out altcoin season, while Bitcoin consolidated further. Instead, BTC dominance rebounded and is currently sitting at 53.5% which is responsible for the bleeding witnessed across the altcoin space.

If DonAlt is right about the next altcoin season being that much sweeter due to the impending decline across the alt space, further accumulation at the bottom of the coming range could end up being a profitable investment for the long term as crypto markets begin to build hype once again.",2019-04-23 20:00:22+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-is-quietly-testing-bitcoin-based-product-under-cxerx-indice-analyst-suggests,"The world's second-largest stock exchange, Nasdaq, is allegedly testing trading of a bitcoin (BTC)-based product, according to a tweet by an analyst at quantitative trading analytics service StrongMarket on April 22.

Twitter personality Cryptopolis, a quantitative analyst at StrongMarket, tweeted that he bought one bitcoin through an account on retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ: AMTD) on Monday.

Cryptopolis suggested that bitcoin was trading on the platform against United States dollar under the unknown symbol “CXERX,” which is purportedly listed on the Nasdaq. The analyst added that BTC/USD trading pair was launched on April 10, 2019, based on the platform's chart.

Following his findings, Cryptopolis reached out to TD Ameritrade’s support for further information. However, support declined to comment on the matter, stating that “it is not a symbol we trade on the live side so Im not really able to speak on it.”

While the analyst concluded that it was not a real trade on his account, he still alleged that Nasdaq is quietly testing a new bitcoin-based asset that is available only through their Paper Trading platform.

In late 2018, Nasdaq reportedly confirmed its plans to launch bitcoin futures in the first half of 2019. VanEck Director of Digital Asset Strategies Gabor Gurbacs also told Cointelegraph that Nasdaq has been discussing futures with Nasdaq, MVIS Indices and other market participants for about 18 months.

In February 2019, Nasdaq started listing two cryptocurrency price indices from United States blockchain and crypto market data company Brave New Coin (BNC), including BNC’s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX).

In turn, TD Ameritrade, which provides investment services to up to 11 million clients, previously announced its backing of new crypto exchange ErisX.

Meanwhile, bitcoin has continued gaining momentum, having broken the $5,500 threshold for the first time in 2019 today. The biggest cryptocurrency is up about 5% over the past 24 hours and 9% over the past 7 days, trading at $5,589 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/21-year-old-jailed-for-10-years-after-stealing-75m-in-crypto-by-hacking-cell-phones,"A 21-year-old man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after becoming one of the first people in the United States to be convicted of stealing cryptocurrency by hacking into cell phones. Prosecutors in Santa Clara announced the jail sentence on April 22.

In February, Joel Ortiz had pleaded guilty and to theft and accepted the 10-year plea deal.

Ortiz stole more than $7.5 million from at least 40 victims: the press release notes that he then spent $10,000 a time at Los Angeles nightclubs, hired a helicopter to fly him and his friends to a music festival, and bought top-end Gucci clothes and luggage.

In May 2018, one cryptocurrency entrepreneur in Cupertino lost $5.2 million in a matter of minutes, prosecutors note.

Prosecutors described the one-time high school valedictorian as a “prolific SIM swapper who targeted victims to steal cryptocurrency and to take over social media accounts with the goal of selling them for bitcoin (BTC).”

Illegal SIM swaps often involve duping phone companies into switching cell phone numbers to a new SIM card by providing stolen addresses and social security numbers. From here, hackers can circumvent two-step authentication measures that are designed to keep crypto safe.

Ortiz was detained at the Los Angeles International Airport last year, and investigators say they have only been able to recover $400,000 of the stolen funds. They believe the rest has either been hidden or spent. Prosecutor Erin West said:

“These are not Robin Hoods. These are crooks who use a computer instead of a gun. They are not just stealing some ethereal, experimental currency. They are stealing college funds, home mortgages, people’s financial lives.”

Oritz had been sentenced on April 19 by a judge after two hearings where victims described the financial devastation caused by his crimes.

In February in a separate case, an individual was indicted in New York for stealing identities and funds, including crypto, in the state’s first SIM swapping prosecution.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/survey-shows-south-koreans-increased-crypto-holdings-by-64-last-year/,"Survey Shows South Koreans Increased Crypto Holdings by 64% Last Year

Over the last few years, South Korea has become a hotspot for cryptocurrencies and the region captures a large amount of the world’s digital asset trade volume. A survey published on April 20 by the Korea Financial Investment Association shows that the average South Korean cryptocurrency trader has increased their crypto holdings by 64.2% over the last year.

South Korean Crypto Investors Increase Holdings

The South Korean news outlet Arirang Daily News revealed the results of a new survey conducted by the Korea Financial Investment Association (KOFIA). The self-regulatory organization’s poll surveyed 2,500 South Korean residents who invested in cryptocurrencies like BCH, ETH, and BTC. Surveys help bolster KOFIA’s goal of ensuring fair trading practices are taking place and enables them to monitor South Korea’s capital market and financial investments. The results of the survey stemmed from a poll taken in December 2018 and the examination reveals 7.4% of the 2,500 individuals surveyed said they own digital currencies. Moreover, South Koreans between 25 and 64 years old who had purchased cryptocurrencies over the last year invested more than $6,000 on average.

The $6,000 average is up two-fold since the organization’s last survey. Interestingly, Arirang’s report also details that older individuals in South Korea were more inclined to invest in cryptocurrencies stating that the most common buyer was in their 50s or older. The second set of surveyed traders who participated in buying more cryptos last year were between 30 and 40 years old. It seems the crypto winter didn’t stop South Korean optimism for digital assets as the average local trader increased their crypto holdings by 64.2% in the past 12 months. The 7.4% who professed to own cryptocurrencies is also up from the year before when the last poll recorded only 6.4% of investors, which indicates traders are a touch more positive this time around.

The Last Few Months Indicate a Resurgence of South Korean Interest in Cryptos

In 2017, cryptocurrency markets were extremely popular among South Korean traders and numbers that year definitely outshone the recent KOFIA poll published this week. According to another survey, one third of South Korean workers were crypto investors in 2017 but the average investment was less at $5,260 per investor. Another difference between then and now was the amount of younger (20s and 30s) South Korean investors was about 80% of the respondents polled. At the time, the South Korean won captured a third of the world’s crypto trade volume in 2017 behind the USD and JPY. Today the currency is still usually a top five trading pair, according to data from sites like Coinlib.io and Cryptocompare.

The recent KOFIA survey shows positivity has increased despite the regulatory crackdowns and a hack that occurred on one of the most popular South Korean trading platforms. South Korean traders have been dealing with much stricter crypto regulations, six cryptocurrency-related bills that were submitted to the National Assembly last December, and Bithumb dealt with a hack that saw the loss of $18 million last March. However, since the cryptocurrency price trend reversal over the last two months, South Korean interest in trading digital assets is growing strong once again. During the first week of April, local traders in South Korea dealt with a ‘Kimchi Premium,’ which saw traders paying more money for cryptos compared to the average global exchange rates. Moreover, trade volumes on Localbitcoins in South Korea have surpassed 2017’s all-time highs during a few weekly periods in February, March, and April 2019.

Japan is preparing to share its experience regarding cryptocurrency regulation with finance ministers and central bank governors from other G20 countries at the upcoming summit which it will host in June. According to local media, Japanese regulators have a solution for crypto regulation to offer the G20 countries.

Crypto Regulatory Manual

Japan is often known as one of the most crypto-advanced countries, having legalized cryptocurrency as a means of payment in April 2017. According to local news outlet Sankeibiz, Japanese regulators will create a handbook “that each [G20] country can use for regulations, such as measures to prevent the outflow of virtual currency.” This matter will be discussed at the G20 summit in June.

“International rules are being developed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, with virtual currency restrictions in place,” the news outlet described Monday. “On the other hand, there are no rules in terms of the protection of customer assets and the soundness of the market, so it is the first time that certain ideas are shared internationally.”

A wide range of regulatory measures are being adopted by the G20 countries, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported, with some currently over-regulating crypto assets. The publication conveyed:

Since it is difficult to establish common rules, we [Japan] decided to put them in a guidebook, to have the know-how in a form that suits each country, and to raise the level of regulation.

According to the news outlet, the manual will address key regulatory areas such as “Necessary measures to protect customer assets,” “Measures against cyber attacks,” and “Ways of providing information to customers.”

The Japanese Experience

Japan is drawing from its own experience after two major cryptocurrency exchanges in the country were hacked last year — Coincheck in January and Zaif in September. Following the hacks, the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), increased its oversight of crypto exchanges including conducting on-site inspections and issuing business improvement orders. The agency has also been holding study group meetings which have resulted in many new proposed measures for the crypto industry.

Earlier this month, the FSA released a guide containing reference cases to help financial institutions identify suspicious crypto transactions and report them to the authorities per Article 8 of the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds.

Crypto transactions involving a large amount of cash or foreign currency and high-value transactions that do not match customer income or assets are suspicious to the FSA. Transactions in accounts that frequently receive crypto remittances from multiple addresses are also suspicious, especially if large withdrawals are made immediately after receiving them, the agency explained.

The FSA also warned of transactions in accounts suspected of being fake or with names that appear to be fictitious, adding that customers with a large number of accounts, especially under different names, should also be red-flagged.

Moreover, the regulator noted that transactions employing “anonymization technology when a customer deposits virtual currency into an account” are suspicious. Also on the list are transactions from multiple accounts using the same IP address, those that appear to be domestic but have foreign IP addresses and languages, and ones “that make tracking IP addresses difficult.”

The news was reported by Moon’s official Twitter on April 22.

While Moon’s regular Chrome browser extension is already available on the Chrome web store, the startup tweeted to note that the lightning feature update is still under review, and is expected to launch imminently.

As previously reported, the bitcoin Lightning Network is a second-layer solution to bitcoin’s scalability limitations, opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.

With Moon serving as intermediary, e-commerce sites like Amazon notably will not handle or process the crypto directly. Rather, Moon will process users’ lightning payments and convert them into fiat currencies, before settling the transaction with a given e-commerce merchant, according to Coindesk.

Moon CEO and founder Ken Kruger underscored to the crypto media outlet that “there’s no direct merchant integration” with e-commerce sites such as Amazon, outlining that:

“We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.”

In a discussion of the extension’s functionality, Kruger revealed that at checkout, users will be provided with a QR code that contains the lightning invoice. Having made their payment, they will be redirected back to the regular payments confirmation page of the e-commerce site.

Consumers who want to use their crypto holdings to shop at e-commerce sites like Amazon are also able to use other third party extensions such as Purse.io, or apps like Gyft and eGifter to buy Amazon gift cards with cryptocurrency.

As previously reported, blockchain development firm Lightning Labs announced the initial release of the Lightning Network offramp Lightning Loop this March, providing a non-custodial way to receive funds via the network.

That same month, Bitcoin mining and development firm Bitfury entered into a partnership with United States payments processor startup HadePay to allow its merchants to accept Lightning Network transactions.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/23/masayoshi-son-invested-in-bitcoin-and-reportedly-lost-130-million.html,"Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, the founder of conglomerate SoftBank, personally lost over $130 million when he sold his position in bitcoin, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

Son made the investment in late 2017 the report said, near the digital currency's record high near $20,000 in December of that year. Bitcoin has traded around $5,000 in recent weeks. While it is unknown exactly how much bitcoin Son bought, he sold early last year after the speculative digital currency's value collapsed.

The move reportedly followed Son receiving a recommendation by a ""bitcoin evangelist."" SoftBank had bought the investment firm of that person earlier in the same year, the report said. Despite his reputation as a keen investor, the bet on bitcoin is not the first such quick, risky bet by Son. He is known widely as someone who will make multi-million dollar investments in companies after only spending a short time with founders and CEOs.

SoftBank is the largest venture capital firm in the world, with a total net asset value estimated as high as $190 billion. Son's focus on long-term investments in tech companies helped him lead the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, with stakes in Uber, Nvidia, Flipkart, WeWork, OneWeb and more.

BlockFi announced the update in a blog post on April 23.

In the announcement, BlockFi also states that it will implement some policy changes starting from May 1, 2019. Specifically, the company says that the minimum deposit to earn interest has been lowered. Bitcoin (BTC) balances of 0.5 BTC and more will begin earning interest on their deposits, while ethereum (ETH) deposits up to 250 ETH will earn 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY).

BlockFi has previously amended some of its policies. In March, the company lowered the interest rates for its biggest cryptocurrency deposit accounts. The company said then that balances of up to or including 25 BTC or 500 ETH would still earn the 6.2% APY, while all balances over that limit were set to earn a 2% rate starting on April 1.

BlockFi has said that it will add a fiat withdrawal fee of 0.0025 BTC and 0.0015 ETH in April, although all withdrawals submitted prior to that will reportedly remain free. “These small adjustments are necessary to ensure that BIA can support as many clients as possible while maintaining the high quality services we provide to the average crypto consumer,” BlockFi explained.

Government-approved cryptocurrency trading platforms in Japan are undergoing changes with big players entering the market. News.Bitcoin.com talked to Japan’s top financial regulator to learn about the regulatory implications of the changing business models and internal systems of regulated exchanges.

Changing Crypto Exchange Landscape

Crypto exchanges in Japan are rapidly transforming with the launch of new exchanges as large corporations entered the market. Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), explained to news.Bitcoin.com Monday that when a crypto exchange is acquired by another company:

There is no need to re-register. If its business model or internal control system are to be changed, FSA will rigorously review them from the perspectives of user protection and others.

The agency further clarified, “If there are changes of entries (such as major shareholders or board members) in the registration application, notification of those changes must be submitted.”

On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the FSA “raided” two crypto exchanges — Huobi Japan and Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange. However, according to the regulator, the visits are routine measures for all exchanges that have undergone internal changes. Huobi Japan recently acquired Bittrade exchange while Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange acquired Zaif.

New Exchanges in Japan

A subsidiary of Yahoo Japan Corp. recently acquired a regulated exchange called Bitarg and changed its name to Taotao on Feb. 4. The new trading platform began accepting pre-registrations on March 25 and is expected to start trading in May. Taotao will only support BTC according to the FSA’s website.

E-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. has acquired Everybody’s Bitcoin exchange which had been in operation since March 30, 2017. The exchange’s name was changed to Rakuten Wallet on March 1 and the old service ended on March 31. The new service became available on April 15. Rakuten Wallet offers the trading of BTC, ETH, and BCH against the Japanese yen. Another registered crypto exchange, Decurret, also began operations on the same day, offering trading of BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, and XRP.

Earlier this year, Bittrade exchange ended its service and began operating as Huobi Japan. The platform offers the trading of BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, MONA, and BCH. Meanwhile, Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange has finalized the asset transfer process from Zaif exchange after the latter was hacked in September last year, the exchange announced Monday.

Adding More Coins

All approved crypto exchanges have to declare what cryptocurrencies they will handle at the time of their application with the FSA. Currently, there are 19 approved crypto exchanges in Japan. The regulator told news.Bitcoin.com:

When a crypto-asset broker-dealer wants to add more crypto-assets or to change old ones into new ones to be traded on its platform, it is required to notify that in advance by the current laws and regulations.

Since some exchanges are owned by foreign companies, the FSA confirmed that “There is no difference between the registration process of a foreign crypto-asset broker-dealer and a Japanese one.” According to the current law, “when a foreign crypto-asset broker-dealer conducts crypto-asset exchange business in Japan, it is required to register as a crypto-asset broker-dealer with the FSA after the establishment of a company limited in Japan,” the regulator concluded.

Cryptopolis, who identifies as a quantitative analyst at trading analytics service firm StrongMarket, says Nasdaq may also be collaborating with TD Ameritrade.

According to Cryptopolis, customer support at the brokerage firm wasn’t forthcoming with information about the matter beyond saying it wasn’t a real trade.

Litecoin creator, Charlie Lee also pointed out that trading is not only being tested for Bitcoin but for Litecoin (LTC) as well. The test shows both cryptocurrencies are being traded against the USD.

Cryptopolis reported that TD Ameritrade customer service seemed unaware of the symbol. Is it a forex symbol or perhaps an index?

The CXERX chart shows the BTC/USD trading pair coming online on Wednesday (April 10, 2019) with the trades based on data from Nasdaq.

Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin

Live spot trading of Bitcoin on the Nasdaq could potentially increase BTC’s institutional appeal. It would also open another vista of institutional adoption for BTC and cryptocurrencies.

Already, firms like Fidelity Investments and Intercontinental Exchange are set to launch custody and futures trading platforms respectively. Nasdaq has also expressed plans to establish a Bitcoin futures trading platform sometime in 2019.

The addition of BTC spot trading would effectively constitute a trifecta of institutional-grade crypto adoption. Experts believe that the influx of big-money players will also act as a tailwind to push the BTC price even higher.

Currently, Bitcoin price 00 is up about 50 percent since the start of 2019. Analysts and commentators alike say the top-ranked cryptocurrency has bottomed out and will experience parabolic gains in the next bull cycle.

If this is indeed the case, then brokerage giants like TD Ameritrade will likely benefit from the increasing interest in Bitcoin and price gains.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Unlike the previous bull market, recovery this time is likely to be a long one because every higher level will bring in huge supply, causing the market to correct. We also expect the markets to take a dip intermittently to shake out the weaker hands.

Many still doubt the future of this nascent asset class. In a recent survey of a few European nations, 63% of participants were confident that cryptocurrencies will exist in 10 years in some form or the other. However, the respondents were not that upbeat on Bitcoin, as only 49% believed that it will exist in 10 year from now. Even fewer, only 7%, hope to see Bitcoin as an investment and security tool in 10 years. This shows that some are still oblivious to the huge potential of this space.

However, companies across the world have been experimenting with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Societe Generale SFH is working towards improving the transparency and transferability of bond issuances. In this regard, it has issued 100 million euro bond as a security token on the Ethereum blockchain.

Samsung might launch its own cryptocurrency named Samsung Coin, according to anonymous sources. Walt Disney Corp. is in talks to buy out online gaming giant NXC Corporation, which in turn has stakes in Korbit and Bitstamp crypto exchanges.

Bitfury has obtained approval for a dedicated bitcoin mining fund for institutional investors from Liechtenstein. This will give an opportunity to the institutions to invest in the interesting world of bitcoin mining.

Currently, altcoins are tumbling. Do any of them offer a buying opportunity? Let’s find out.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently facing some resistance close to $5,600. However, both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is still close to overbought levels. This shows that the bulls are in charge. On the upside, a breakout of $5,600 can propel the price to the next critical zone of $5,674.84–$5,900. We anticipate the bears to defend this zone. Hence, traders can book partial profits on their remaining long positions above $5,600 and keep the stop loss on the rest at $4,800.

Conversely, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the next support at $4,914.11. This is a critical support, which might hold. A breakdown of this level will hurt sentiment as it will weaken momentum and indicate that the bears are still shorting at higher levels. If the bulls fail to defend $4,914.11, the digital currency can dip to the 50-day SMA. The next few days are critical as it will determine whether the recovery is over or if this is only a shakeout.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) again reversed direction from the overhead resistance at $180 on April 23. The price has broken down of the 20-day EMA and has re-entered the triangle, which is a bearish sign. This shows that the breakout from the triangle did not find any buyers at higher levels.

If the bulls fail to push the price back above $167.32 within the next couple of days, the ETH/USD pair can drop to the 50-day SMA. A break of this support can sink the pair to $144.78. Hence, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150. We would have suggested closing the entire position but the moving averages are still sloping up and the RSI is at the midpoint, which shows that the bulls are still in the game.

If the bulls quickly push the price back above $167.32, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance zone of $180–$187.98. It will pick up momentum above $187.98.

XRP/USD

After holding the 50-day SMA for four days, Ripple (XRP) plunged below it today. This is a negative sign. It can now drop to $0.27795, which is a critical support. If this support also gives way, a retest of the yearly low at $0.24508 will be in the cards.

However, if the support at $0.27795 holds, the XRP/USD pair might remain range bound for a few more days. The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the RSI has dived into the negative territory, which suggests the bears are back in command. The pair has been one of the weakest digital currencies as it has not participated in the recent recovery. This shows a lack of demand for it. We therefore withdraw the existing buy recommendation. We will wait for the price to signal a trend reversal before suggesting a long position in it.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and is on its way to the next support at $255. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is at the center, which points to a consolidation in the near term.

If the bulls fail to defend $255, it will be a negative sign. The next stop is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally at $241.97. If this level also fails to hold, the drop can stretch to the 50-day SMA. The trend is gradually turning in favor of the bears, but if the BCH/USD pair finds buyers at $255, it will remain range bound between $255 and $335.63 for a few days.

EOS/USD

The attempts by the bulls to push EOS back above the 20-day EMA did not sustain. It has plunged below the support and is on its way to the next support of $4.4930. The uptrend line of the rising wedge is at this level and the 50-day SMA is placed just above it. Therefore, we expect a strong defense by the bulls.

But if the price breaks down of the uptrend line, it will complete the bearish rising wedge pattern that has a target objective of $2.80. However, there are a slew of supports between $3.8723 and $3.00. We expect one of these to hold. With the 20-day EMA weakening and the RSI in the negative territory, the bears are attempting to regain the upper hand.

Nonetheless, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the price back above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. If successful, a rally to $6.0726 and above it to $6.8299 is possible. We suggest traders wait for the price to stabilize and signal a turnaround before attempting to go long.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) failed to rise above the 20-day EMA after breaking down of it on April 21. This attracted further selling and the bears broke down the immediate support of $74.6054. The price is presently at the 50-day SMA, which is a strong support. If this support also breaks, the drop can extend to $62.450.

Conversely, if the LTC/USD pair rebounds from the 50-day SMA, it will attempt to rise to the overhead resistance of $91. The 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the RSI has declined into the negative zone. This suggests that the bears are making a comeback. Considering the weakness, we have withdrawn the buy proposed in our earlier analysis. We will wait for the uptrend to resume before suggesting a trade in it.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) has pulled back to the 20-day EMA after failing to make a new high on April 20. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the trend is bullish. The RSI has also corrected the overbought levels. If the price rebounds from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to retest the lifetime highs.

However, if the BNB/USD pair slips below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the uptrend line of the rising wedge. The 50-day SMA is just below this level, hence, we anticipate a strong support at this level, but if the price fails to hold this support, it will complete a bearish rising wedge pattern that has a minimum target objective of $13.60. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has broken down of the 50-day EMA and the immediate support of $0.1090. It is currently trying to find some support at the uptrend line. The 20-day EMA is starting to turn down and the RSI has dived below 50. This shows that the bears have the upper hand.

If the bulls defend the uptrend line, the XLM/USD pair might attempt to bounce back above the moving averages. If the price ascends the moving averages, it will then face resistance at the downtrend line.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line, it will become negative and can slide to $0.08.

ADA/USD

Though Cardano (ADA) broke out of the channel on April 23, it hit a roadblock at $0.082952. Currently, the price has dipped to the 50-day SMA, which is a strong support. But if this level gives way, a fall to the support of the channel is probable.

The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone. This shows that the bulls are losing their grip over the ADA/USD pair. It will show signs of strength if it can break out of the channel and rise above the overhead resistances of $0.082952 and $0.094256. We will wait for the price to stop falling before turning positive.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) triggered our suggested stop loss on the long positions at $0.024 on April 23. The bulls have failed to push prices higher. Hence, it can now drop to the next support at $0.02094452. The 20-day EMA has turned down and the RSI has dipped into the negative territory. This shows that the bears have the upper hand in the near term.

If $0.02094452 holds, the TRX/USD pair might remain range-bound for a few days, but if the support breaks, the fall can extend to $0.0183. Any attempt to recover will face resistance at $0.02815521. Considering the repeated failed breakout attempts, we shall wait for the price to rise above $0.035 before suggesting any fresh positions once again.

The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has also dipped into the negative territory. This shows that the bears are gaining an upper hand in the short-term.

Charts for analysis are provided by TradingView.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/63-of-europeans-say-that-crypto-will-exist-in-10-years-but-only-49-believe-in-bitcoin,"63% of Europeans are confident that crypto will still exist in 10 years, according to new research from bitFlyer. London-based fintech publication FStech reported on the survey on April 24.

Tokyo-based crypto exchange bitFlyer, which was licensed to operate in the European Union in 2018, reportedly polled 10,000 respondents in Europe to find out what they think about cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC).

The exchange reportedly surveyed the following ten countries: the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain.

When asked about crypto in general, the majority of Europeans claimed that they believe that crypto will exist in 10 years, with more than 50% of respondents in each country predicting that will still exist in some form.

Specifically, Norwegian respondents turned out to be the most optimistic about the future of crypto, with 73% thinking that crypto will exist. On the other hand, French respondents were the most pessimistic about the future of crypto, with only 55% claiming that they believe in crypto in the long-term.

Fewer Europeans turned out to be confident about the biggest cryptocurrency — bitcoin — with an average of 49% of respondents thinking that bitcoin will exist 10 years from now. According to the study, French respondents were the least optimistic about bitcoin, with only 40% of respondents claiming that the crypto will still be around, while Italian and Polish respondents expressed the most confidence about the major cryptocurrency, with 55% and 53% speaking in favor of bitcoin, respectively.

More particularly, very few Europeans expressed the belief that bitcoin will be an investment and a security tool in 10 years, with an average of 7% of Europeans stating that they believe so.

Andy Bryant, COO at bitFlyer Europe, reportedly said that the poll results indicate that the reputation of cryptocurrency has moved beyond hype and become more established. Bryant concluded that the industry disruptors should promote particular benefits and use cases of crypto, so that people can understand how the technology will come to be used in society.

Recently, Reuters reported that France is going to try to convince other EU member states to adopt cryptocurrency regulations similar to its own.

On April 15, Corporate Traveller, the largest travel management firm in the UK, announced it started accepting bitcoin for payments.",,https://www.coindesk.com/samsung-invests-2-9-million-into-crypto-hardware-startup-ledger,"South Korean technology giant Samsung has invested 2.6 million euros ($2.9 million) into crypto hardware startup Ledger.

The investment gives the startup a valuation of roughly $290 million, French business magazine Capital reported Wednesday. A spokesperson for Ledger confirmed that Samsung backed the startup, but could not confirm further details. A Samsung representative did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The news, coinciding with Ledger promoting Pascal Gauthier to CEO, follows previous funding rounds by the company, including a $7 million Series A fund raise in 2017 and a $75 million Series B in 2018. It is unclear whether Samsung’s investment is part of a larger funding round.

Ledger’s previous CEO and co-founder, Éric Larchevêque, confirmed the investment but declined to comment further, Capital reported. On Twitter, Larchevêque seemingly confirmed the news as well, saying in one tweet (translated from French) that “We will always need hardware wallets, but to accompany a revolution crypto based on a personal sovereignty accessible to all, the smartphone will actually play a central role.”

According to his Twitter bio, Larchevêque now serves as Ledger’s executive chairman.

A logical match

Ledger is currently working with various banks and other firms to offer a number of custody options. A custody venture with Japanese bank Nomura is expected to launch by 2020, while the hardware developer is simultaneously collaborating with Hong Kong-licensed Legacy Trust to offer custody services for ethereum-based tokens.

For its part, Samsung recently stormed into the crypto and blockchain space. It recently announced that a forthcoming new line of flagship smartphones – the Galaxy S10 series – will include crypto wallet functionality. And the company is now said to be working on its own unique blockchain based on ethereum.

Indeed, Samsung may one day issue its own token, according to CoinDesk Korea.

Ledger confirmed Samsung’s investment Thursday, saying in a statement:

“We are excited to confirm Samsung Ventures’ investment in Ledger. We believe Samsung Ventures will add value to further enhance our position as a leading provider of best-in-class security solutions as we continue to deliver innovative hardware wallet technology to meet the demands of both today’s and tomorrow’s mobile consumer market.”

An exclusive CoinDesk Korea report on Tuesday, citing a person “familiar with Samsung’s internal situation,” said that the company’s blockchain task force – part of its wireless division – is building a blockchain mainnet based on ethereum. The work, however, is still at the “internal experimental” stage.

The source said:

“Currently, we are thinking of private blockchain, though it is not yet confirmed. It could also be public blockchain in the future, but I think it will be hybrid – that is, a combination of public and private blockchains.”

When the development of the blockchain is completed, Samsung may also move to launch a “Samsung Coin” token, according to the report.

The person said:

“The market expects Samsung Coin to come out, but the direction has not yet been decided.”

If the company develops a public blockchain in the future, then Samsung Coin could be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges just like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Samsung could also bring blockchain technology to its payments app Samsung Pay, but the move is not yet decided, according to the source.

Samsung’s blockchain task force has been in active development for at least a year, and is working on a number of projects, according to the report.

Two months ago, the company made a leap into the blockchain arena with the unveiling of its flagship cellphone, the Galaxy S10, which has the ability to store cryptocurrency private keys and other features such as support blockchain-based digital signatures.

In March, Samsung officially revealed the cryptocurrency wallet, which is compatible with ether (ETH) and ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, although notably not bitcoin in early glimpses. According to some reports, the wallet is not yet available in some jurisdictions.

The S10 also supports decentralized apps (dapps) such as crypto gaming platform Enjin, beauty community Cosmee, crypto collectibles platform CryptoKitties and merchant payments service CoinDuck.

On April 24, Gifto announced that it’s moving house from Ethereum to Binance Chain. In doing so, it joins half a dozen other projects that have recently committed to the most talked about new blockchain in town. Blockchain migration can occur for a number of reasons, but beyond providing an instant shot of publicity, does making the move yield any long-term benefits?

Tokenized Projects Can’t Stop Chain Hopping

“While we have tremendous respect for what the Ethereum community has built, it’s time for Gifto … to move to a new blockchain that better suits our aggressive plans for mainstream adoption,” reads the blog post released today by the South Korean gifting protocol. “One where the real usage and growth of the Gifto ecosystem can be shown today without incurring massive fees or slow transaction times which negatively impact user experience.”

Gifto’s reasons for moving to a faster and more payment-centric chain make sense given that its GTO token has little need for Ethereum’s smart contract functionality. The fact that Gifto was the first tokenized project to feature on Binance Launchpad meant that when the project began eyeing alternative blockchains, there was only going to be one winner. The reasons quoted for the switch – fees and network congestion – are the most commonly cited for projects jumping ship.

Impatience and Irreconcilable Differences – Two Reasons for Abandoning Chain

One of the reasons why Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) has begun to be used for token issuance is on account of the low onchain fees and fast confirmation times that are a hallmark of the Bitcoin Cash network. While it’s early days for SLP’s tokenized ecosystem, the participation of projects such as Liberland has heightened interest. Ongoing delays to the Lightning Network have caused some cryptocurrency users to switch to Bitcoin Cash, as onchain fees for BTC have begun to creep towards the $2 mark in recent weeks. Similarly, the promise of decentralized Lightning apps – or “Lapps” – has yet to materialize, making the prospect of building on BCH seem appealing to some developers.

Aside from scalability issues, there’s another reason why projects may elect to switch blockchains: for publicity. Latching onto the coat tails of the hottest new blockchain can be a way to fleetingly revive the fortunes of a flagging project. When EOS launched in 2018, a number of ERC20 projects chose to entrust their fate to Dan Larimer’s latest creation, and promptly set about initiating token swaps. While news of a blockchain migration can inflate a token’s price, the effects are short-lived. Ultimately, it will require more than a new crypto network to generate sustained interest.

Multiple Chains Existing in Tandem

In its announcement on April 24, Gifto made no bones about its reasons for leaving Ethereum, explaining: “Let’s face it, fancy features like smart contracts are great, but when they slow down transactions and open up security vulnerabilities, they are not worth it if all you want to do is to pay cryptocurrency for a virtual gift. As consumer application developers, we should not need a sub-industry of smart contract security audit companies every time we want to add a crypto payment method to our apps.”

For outsiders, peering curiously into the world of cryptocurrency, blockchain networks and their never-ending array of token swaps and chain migrations must appear like some strange form of digital cannibalization. In addition to tokenized projects merrily chain hopping, networks themselves often begin life on a rival’s chain. EOS launched as an ERC20 token, for example, before swapping once its own mainnet was ready. Binance is currently doing the same with BNB, which is transitioning to Binance Chain.

Whereas holders of EOS ERC20 tokens were given a strict timeline in which to upgrade or risk being lumped with worthless tokens, Gifto is taking a more relaxed approach to its chain migration, and will support ERC20 and Binance Chain’s BEP2 in its wallet simultaneously for the foreseeable future. As its announcement cheerily concludes, “Welcome to the cross-chain world.”

Prove ownership on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain for only 0.0005 BCH. Using the Bitcoin.com Notary.",2019-04-24 11:46:11+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/new-york-state-sees-first-conviction-for-crypto-money-laundering,"A case involving millions of dollars in bitcoin and Western Union payments has resulted in New York State’s first conviction for cryptocurrency money laundering.

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday that defendants Callaway Crain and Mark Sanchez, both 35, laundered $2.8 million earned through sales of controlled substances carried out over the internet.

Between 2013 and 2018, the two men sold steroids and other drugs including Viagra across the U.S. via their website “NextDayGear” and on the dark web. They sold over 10,000 packages and accepted payments in cryptocurrency and fiat currency via Western Union, which they then laundered.

Customers usually paid in bitcoin, the Attorney’s Office said, with the defendants laundering the proceeds via one or more “intermediary” cryptocurrency wallets to obfuscate the source of the funds. The bitcoin was then converted to U.S. dollars using a cryptocurrency exchange platform before the cash was deposited into their bank accounts.

Western Union payments, on the other hand, were laundered through the use of false identities or international wire transfers from receivers outside of the U.S..

The duo has now pleaded guilty and faces a jail term of 2.5–7.5 years, with sentencing expected to take place on July 12.

Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., said:

“These defendants raked in crypto and cash worth millions on their full-service website that sold prescription-free counterfeit steroids and other controlled substances to customers in all 50 states.”

“Online drug sellers who do business in New York should take note: whether you’re operating in plain sight or in hidden corners of the dark web, my Office has the skills and resources to follow the money, shut down your business, and hold you accountable,” Vance warned.

Just last week, the same DA’s office also indicted three individuals for dealing in drugs and laundering $2.3 million in cryptocurrency by using preloaded debit cards and withdrawing cash at ATMs in Manhattan and New Jersey.

The Gaza-based Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which is proscribed by the United States and the European Union, has been calling on its supporters to donate using the digital currency in a fundraising campaign announced online in late January.

Originally, it asked donors to send bitcoin to a single digital address, or wallet.

However, according to research shared with Reuters by leading blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, in recent weeks it has changed the mechanism, with its website generating a new digital wallet with every transaction.

This makes it harder for companies around the world to keep tabs on the group’s cryptocurrency financing, the researchers said. A single digital wallet can be red-flagged to cryptocurrency exchanges, in theory allowing them to prevent funds moving through their systems to that destination.

But a different wallet for each donation makes this so-called tagging far more complicated, Elliptic said.

Between March 26 and April 16, 0.6 bitcoin - worth around $3,300 - was sent to the website-created wallets, Elliptic’s research found. All told, the four-month fundraising campaign has raised around $7,400, the firm said.

A spokesman for Hamas, which has ruled the Palestinian territory of Gaza since 2007, declined to comment on Elliptic’s research.

Such funds are a fraction of the tens of millions of dollars in annual funding that Israel and the United States says Hamas receives from Iran. Yet the campaign gives insight into how a proscribed group has gone about bitcoin fundraising.

“They are still in experimentation stage - trying it out, seeing how much they can raise, and whether it works,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson.

Iran has not publicly detailed its funding of Hamas, though it has not denied its support for the group. Hamas has said Tehran is the biggest backer of the al-Qassam Brigades.

London-based Elliptic and U.S. rival Chainalysis are the most prominent blockchain analysis firms, and have gained traction as watchdogs, cryptocurrency companies and firms such as hedge funds seek tools to track digital coins.

Backed by investors including Banco Santander’s venture capital arm, Elliptic’s clients include financial firms, regulators and law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States.

Since 2016 it has won contracts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service and Drug Enforcement Administration, according to USAspending.gov here, a database of U.S. government contracts.

Examples of cryptocurrency funding campaigns by proscribed groups are rare. But the research underscores headaches for companies in the emerging sector in identifying and stamping out exposure to potentially tainted digital coins, even as tools for tracking and tracing cryptocurrencies grow more sophisticated.

Dealing with illegal usage is seen as vital if cryptocurrencies are to grow from niche, speculative tokens to assets embraced by the mainstream. Most big financial firms have steered clear of bitcoin and its kin, with money laundering chief among concerns.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. Others, including Britain, have proscribed only the al-Qassam Brigades.

Such a designation means that, in the United States for instance, it is illegal to provide money or training, with financial firms in control of related funds obliged to report them to the authorities.

A two-minute video on the al-Qassam Brigades website lays out step-by-step instructions in Arabic on how supporters can avoid the traditional financial system and donate cryptocurrency.

“How to support the Palestinian resistance via Bitcoin?” it asks.

With polished graphics and English subtitles, it explains how to send bitcoin directly, through a money-exchange office, or via a cryptocurrency exchange. “Use a public device so that the wallet is not linked to your IP address,” it says.

Elliptic uses a database of information linking digital coin addresses to exchanges, darkweb marketplaces, and proscribed groups to track cryptocurrencies.

It pinpointed wallets created by the website by tracking patterns in their unique addresses. The firm monitored these addresses, later identifying multiple transactions that sent funds from the addresses to a major Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange.

Thirteen of the donations were made from a separate exchange, also from Asia, said Elliptic, which declined to give further details of the exchanges. It was not clear whether the bitcoin had since been converted to traditional currencies, the firm said.

PATCHY REGULATION

Hamas’s finances are suffering. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi in 2013 closed hundreds of tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border, preventing the smuggling of weapons and goods from cows to cars, depriving Hamas of tax income.

Funding from Iran has also declined following Hamas’s condemnation of the killing of Sunni Muslims in Syria’s civil war, analysts say.

Bitcoin could provide respite in that cash squeeze.

“It makes it difficult for such funds to be tracked by financial authorities,” said Lotem Finkelshtein, head of threat intelligence at Check Point Technologies, a cybersecurity firm in Tel Aviv.

“It’s not so simple to link wallets to organizations.”

Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, defense ministry and military declined to comment.

Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who is also a member of the national security cabinet, told the website Ynet TV this month he was unaware of the fundraising.

Regulators and law enforcement agencies have long worried about the potential of digital money - relatively anonymous and easily available online - to finance terrorism.

Cryptocurrency regulations vary from country to country. The global watchdog for money laundering, aware of gaps in rules, is due to bring in the first international standards on cryptocurrency oversight by June.

But with regulation still patchy, the risk of exposure to tainted coins has kept most big investors away.

Even indirect exposure to tainted cryptocurrencies would present problems for financial firms, said Kyle Phillips, a lawyer at Fieldfisher law firm.

“There are real issues with establishing the beneficial owners,” he said.",2019-04-26 06:09:51+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/at-least-95-percent-of-crypto-crimes-involve-bitcoin-chainalysis-executive-says,"At least 95% of cryptocurrency crimes investigated by law enforcement involve bitcoin (BTC,) the co-founder and COO of Chainalysis told Fortune on April 24.

Jonathan Levin, whose company offers investigation software for law enforcement to pursue bad actors, said BTC is “by far the favorite” for hackers and criminals.

He revealed that law enforcement needs to take more sophisticated approaches to tackle darknets — and warned that the crypto industry was starting to see the beginnings of terrorism financing.

Levin said the records left behind by crypto transactions has led to many arrests, as officials in the United States tackle the deadly opioid crisis and try to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country, often from China. He told Fortune:

“What we’ve seen is that there is the ability to tie some of those cryptocurrency transactions either to the pharmacies in China or actually to the services that people are using to distribute fentanyl.”

According to Levin, the transparency of cryptocurrencies is helping law enforcement to build cases against suspects quicker than in traditional finance, namely because investigators no longer need to rely on obtaining records from foreign banks.

Even though bitcoin is overwhelmingly used by crypto criminals, Levin noted that Chainalysis has launched real-time transaction monitoring for 10 cryptocurrencies, as well as a basket of stablecoins, because law enforcement agencies are trying to investigate hacks on crypto exchanges where other tokens are stolen.

Levin also said he has been investigating the case of QuadrigaCX, the major Canadian crypto exchange that was officially declared bankrupt earlier this month. The company lost access to cold wallets and corresponding keys following the CEO’s death in December last year, and reportedly owes more than $195 million to 115,000 customers.

In the interview, the Chainalysis executive suggested Quadriga “was operating on fractional reserve and in deep trouble”:

“We were looking at the bitcoin holdings and also tether holdings of Quadriga and what we found very quickly was that Quadriga as an exchange actually didn’t have those customer funds that were reported in the media to be lost. Those funds actually never existed.”

Levin also repeated claims made in a Chainalysis report earlier this year that two hacker groups have been responsible for stealing $1 billion in cryptocurrency, representing the majority of the funds lost in scams.",,https://www.coindesk.com/how-crypto-markets-are-reacting-to-the-tether-bitfinex-allegations,"The cryptocurrency markets endured a loss of as much as $10 billion around 21:00 UTC on Thursday, following allegations that the Bitfinex exchange covered up an $850 million shortfall using the U.S. dollar-pegged Tether (USDT) stablecoin.

The New York Attorney General’s office alleged in a statement on Thursday that Bitfinex lost $850 million and used customer and corporate funds from the affiliated stablecoin operator Tether in a coverup.

The allegations appear to have affected USDT’s peg to the U.S. dollars, and have shaken market confidence that triggered an overall sell-off with larger cryptos by market cap such as ether and XRP down 6.99 and 4.8 percent, respectively.

Based on data from CoinMarketCap, the overall crypto market’s capitalization dropped by $10 billion to as low as $167 billion around early Friday morning UTC time, and has since then climbed back above $172 billion as of press time.

Daily chart – Tether

At 21:00 UTC on Thursday, the price of USDT began to fall from the desired set price of $1.00 to as low as around $0.955, according to data from the Kraken and OKCoin U.S exchanges – the two that provide trading pair for USDT against the U.S. dollars.

The USDT price has since then climbed back and is currently changing hands around $0.97 on both Kraken and OKCoin, and may see further price uncertainty as the day continues to develop.

Other stablecoin assets such as USDC, TrueUSD and GUSD are all in the green up between 0.25 and 3 percent as a result of shifting investor funds toward some of the other more regulated alternatives.

Interestingly, Maker (MKR), the crypto asset behind the MakerDAO stablecoin project is down 14.65 percent over a 24-hour period, having dropped $73 in value and is currently the worst performer among the top 25 crypto. All despite recent upgrades to stabilize its value through a fee increase.

Daily chart – Other markets

Meanwhile, as seen above, the reaction to the Bitfinex and tether allegations has been negative with the majority of cryptocurrencies flashing red today.

Bitcoin has since recovered slightly and is changing hands at $5,138 after dropping to a low of $4,953 on the Coinbase exchange late Thursday.

And Whale Alert, a Twitter service that monitors blockchain transactions, notified that hours after the news, 3,999 bitcoin, which was worth $20 million, got moved out from Bitfinex’s exchange wallets to unknown addresses.

Such recent moves are indicative of trader’s sentiment who are currently seeking to reduce their risk by transferring funds away from the allegedly troubled exchange.

However, others have fared better than some with the majority of stablecoins seeing upside action as investors shift their preference away from Tether to other viable options such as Circle’s USDC or Gemini’s GUSD.

Ether is today’s worst performing asset amongst the top 3 major networks, down 6.91 percent and is struggling to find a strong bid beyond $152 after falling from $165 at 21:00 UTC yesterday.

According to a recent survey of 10,000 European residents, 63% believe that cryptocurrencies will still be around in 10 years. However, polled respondents were not so confident about bitcoin core (BTC) lasting over the next decade as only 49% of participants believe BTC will be around.

63% of 10,000 Polled Europeans Believe Cryptocurrencies Will Still Exist in 10 Years

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Bitflyer was recently licensed to operate in the European Union, and on April 24 the company’s European arm published a poll of 10,000 residents from various countries to find out how popular digital currencies are today. The survey was sent to residents from Norway, France, Belgium, Germany, and other regions while the researchers also parsed the responses by country. The biggest question on the survey asked participants if they believe cryptocurrencies will still exist in 10 years. Out of the entire lot of respondents, 63% think cryptos will still be around within the next decade.

Residents from Norway seem extremely positive as 73% believe that digital currencies will continue to trend in the future. This is followed by those in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Denmark, and Germany who voted above the 60th percentile. Respondents from Belgium, the U.K., and France showed stronger pessimism (59% or lower) toward cryptocurrencies lasting over the next 10 years. Andy Bryant, COO of Bitflyer Europe, said the poll results indicate that people are looking past the prior cryptocurrency hype and digital assets have become more established.

“It’s very easy to forget just how new cryptocurrencies still are; we’ve only just celebrated bitcoin’s 10th birthday, so for the majority of consumers to believe in crypto’s future is without a doubt an achievement,” Bryant stated after publishing the poll.

Lack of Confidence in BTC Dominance

As for the coin with the largest market capitalization today, bitcoin core (BTC), Europeans are less confident in its existence going forward. Only 49% of all the European respondents think BTC will exist 10 years from now. When separated by country, Italy (55%), Poland (53%), Spain (51%), the Netherlands (51%), and Norway (50%) expressed the most confidence in BTC. The poll also shows that Denmark (49%), Belgium (45%), the U.K. (43%), and France (40%) are the least optimistic about BTC’s future. Only 7% of all the European respondents believe that BTC will still exist as “an investment” in the next decade.

Respondents in Poland are positive BTC will still exist as an investment in the next decade but only 11% of them feel this way. This is followed respectively by Italy (9%), Belgium (9%), Germany (8%), the Netherlands (7%), Norway (6%), Denmark (6%), Spain (6%), France (6%), and the U.K. (4%). The poll indicates that a good portion of Europeans think digital assets will do well in the next 10 years in regard to the cryptoconomy as a whole. On the other hand, respondents showed considerably less optimism in BTC over the next decade, and BTC market dominance is also a good indication of the declining popularity of the digital asset.

BTC’s market dominance plummeted after staying above 78% for seven years. The decline took place on March 6, 2017, and BTC dominance has been wavering between 33-56% since Jan. 8, 2018. Furthermore, the Bitflyer poll capturing the opinions of 10,000 unique individuals from various countries across the European Union is a nice data set in regard to the sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in 2019 and beyond.

The San Francisco-based firm sold a total of $169.42 million in XRP in Q1, compared with $129.03 million in the previous quarter, it announced Wednesday.

Ripple further said that direct institutional sales of XRP totaled $61.93 million in Q1 – 54 percent more than the previous quarter. Programmatic sales of the cryptocurrency, meanwhile, grew from $88.88 million to $107.49 million, an increase of 21 percent.

It’s not all good news, though. The total volume of XRP traded globally decreased by about 2 percent to reach $53.85 billion in Q1 as compared to $54.82 billion in Q4 of last year.

Further, looking at the year-on-year figures, XRP sales have not shown significant growth. In Q1 of 2018, the firm sold $167.7 million-worth of XRP, which is just 1.03 percent less than Q1 of this year.

Ripple said that it released 3 billion XRPs out of escrow accounts in Q1 2019 and an additional 2.30 billion XRPs were returned and put into new escrow contracts. “The remaining 700 million XRP not returned to escrow are being used in a variety of ways to help support the XRP ecosystem,” the firm explained.

XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is now listed on around 120 exchanges, as 19 new exchanges moved to list the cryptocurrency in Q1 2019, according to Ripple’s data.

January to March 2019 was also the second-lowest volatility quarter since Q4 2013 for XRP, Ripple added, as “rolling volatility of 30-day returns steadily declined throughout the quarter.”

Blockfi Launching in India

New Jersey-based crypto startup Blockfi announced Tuesday that it has expanded service to users in India. Its flagship Blockfi Interest Account (BIA) for BTC and ETH is now available in 65 countries.

“As of this month, over $53 million in client crypto is stored with Blockfi,” the company shared, adding that “We saw a huge amount of demand from India over the last month and we’re excited to welcome their crypto community to our platform.”

A Blockfi representative told news.Bitcoin.com Wednesday:

All of Blockfi’s products will be available to retail and institutions in India. Blockfi have already had clients from India sign up for our services.

Launched in March, BIAs pay interest in cryptocurrency at the beginning of each month. The company explained that it generates interest on assets held in these accounts by lending them to institutional and corporate borrowers.

The account offers 6.2% annual interest compounded monthly for customers with balances of up to and including 25 BTC or 500 ETH. All balances over that limit will earn a tiered rate of 2% interest. The 2% rate was introduced on April 1 due to “unanticipated demand from businesses like crypto hedge funds and VC firms,” the company detailed at the time.

Blockfi CEO Zac Prince confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com Wednesday:

We plan to support additional assets in the interest account but are not able to disclose which ones or specific timing at this point.

Lower Minimum Requirements

Blockfi also announced Tuesday that, starting May 1, the minimum required BTC balance to earn interest will be lowered to 0.5 BTC, with an expectation to lower it further in the near future. Furthermore, the lower balance requirement will be applied retroactively as of April 1 so customers with balances of between 0.5 BTC and 1 BTC this month will be eligible to receive interest at the end of the month.

Deposits of up to 250 ETH will also earn 6.2% APY. However, Blockfi revealed that “Over the past month, demand for borrowing ETH has dropped, and as a result, ETH tier rates will be adjusted in tandem.”

Local Exchange Competing

In comparison, local Indian crypto exchange Coindcx launched a lending program on March 21 that lets users earn up to 2% interest monthly, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. Six cryptocurrencies are eligible with more to be added in the near future. The interest rate on deposited BTC is 2%, USDT 1%, BNB 1%, TUSD 1%, XRP 0.75% and ETH 0.75%.

CEO Summit Gupta told news.Bitcoin.com Wednesday that, on his platform, the “annualized interest rate is 26.82% on BTC,” adding that he has seen high interest among users since launch “because the interest rates are good … and users can cancel anytime.”

While Blockfi offers an annual interest rate of 6.2% on BTC, Gupta claims that his exchange offers 24% and requires only 0.01 BTC or 0.01 ETH minimum deposit to earn interest versus Blockfi’s 0.5 BTC and 25 ETH. He further noted that the lock-in period for his exchange is 7 days while it is 1 month for Blockfi, elaborating that withdrawals are also instant on his exchange while Blockfi usually takes 24 hours but could take up to 7 days.

“We use the borrowed funds to provide margin to our Dcxmargin users,” Coindcx explained, noting that while KYC is not required for lending cryptocurrencies, it is for users wanting to withdraw more than 2 BTC per day.

Similar Programs Worldwide

There are similar programs around the globe such as Ledgerx’s Ledgersavings program which currently offers an annualized implied rate of around 16% on BTC. Nexo offers up to 6.5% annual interest on stablecoins. Ethereum-based Compound service offers varying interest rates on users’ BAT, DAI, REP, WETH, and ZRX.

Several regulated crypto exchanges in Japan also have similar programs. GMO Coin started paying up to 5% interest annually on BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, and XRP in May last year based on the need of the exchange which could change monthly.

Coincheck has a lending program for BTC, paying up to 5% annually. Prior to the January hack, the exchange paid interest on 12 different cryptocurrencies. Bitbank, another regulated Japanese exchange, is paying between 3% to 5% interest annually. While only BTC is currently supported, the exchange plans to add BCH, ETH, LTC, XRP, and MONA to the program.

The Malta Financial Services Authority’s (MFSA) new guidance note intends to warn the public about cryptocurrency investments and related risks, and educate people on how to identify and avoid scams and fraudulent schemes.

The guidance reportedly outlines the most common types of digital currency-associated scams, which include fake iInitial coin offerings (ICOs), crowdfunding ventures promising higher gains which are availed of once the coin becomes active, and fake exchange platforms and fake e-wallet apps.

The document also provides a list of the 11 most common warning signs potential investors should consider, including “unrealistically high rates of return which are usually higher than the market average; promises that any funds deposited are 100% guaranteed; aggressive selling techniques which put pressure and rush you to secure a sale; contradiction between documents and spoken information” among others.

In early April, the MFSA approved its first 14 crypto assets agents that previously sought a license. The approval came five months after the Virtual Financial Assets Act, which was adopted by Maltese government last year, came into power. The agents are now obliged to evaluate their customers’ business plans and ensure they are properly prepared before submitting an application to the MFSA.

In March, the MFSA appointed blockchain security firm CipherTrace to monitor activity by crypto businesses in Malta. CipherTrace is now responsible for overseeing regulatory processes and audit risk management of virtual asset businesses licensed in Malta. The United States-based blockchain security company will assist the MFSA in combating money laundering and financing terrorism risks associated with entities involved in crypto businesses.",

The entire market shed about $10 billion in value in the space of an hour late Thursday, CoinMarketCap data showed. This after the New York attorney general accused the operator of bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and tether issuer Tether Limited of hiding an $850 million loss.

The state's top lawyer alleges Bitfinex used at least $700 million from Tether's cash reserves to cover up the apparent loss of $850 million of client and corporate funds. Its findings were detailed in papers filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.

Tether is a cryptocurrency that is meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar — otherwise known as a stablecoin. Worries have been raised over whether Tether Limited holds enough dollars to back all the tokens in circulation.

The price of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has fallen 4% over the last 24 hours, according to industry website CoinDesk. In the same time period, the prices of ethereum and XRP — the world's second and third-largest virtual currencies by market value — also dropped 6% and 3%, respectively. Tether's price fell over 1%, coming off its dollar peg.

The attorney general's office said Thursday that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly ""engaged in a series of conflicted corporate transactions"" — where Bitfinex gave itself access to Tether's cash reserves.",2019-04-26,https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/bitfinex-alleged-850m-fraud/,"In what seems like a historic moment in crypto, the New York state attorney general’s office has announced that it is investigating iFinex, the company behind exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin Tether, over an alleged $850 million fraud.

Attorney General Letitia James’ office said on Thursday that it is looking at how the company (apparently) lost $850 million, which is said to have gone missing through a deal with Panama-based Crypto Capital. iFinex reportedly selected Crypto Capital as a payment processor to handle customer payouts after a series of banks refused to do business, including Wells Fargo, which had previously taken transfers from its Taiwan-based accounts.

When it became evident that the money wouldn’t be returned, iFinex is said to have taken “at least” $700 million from the reserves that (apparently) back Tether, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar. The deal was not declared to investors.

“Those transactions treat Tether’s cash reserves as Bitfinex’s corporate slush fund, and are being used to hide Bitfinex’s massive, undisclosed losses and inability to handle customer withdrawals,” Attorney General James’ office argued in a release.

iFinex also stands accused of allowing New York-based investors to use Bitfinex to trade Tether without holding a license to operate in the state of New York.

In response, iFinex has claimed that “the New York Attorney General’s court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions.”

“We have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded. We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released. Sadly, the New York Attorney General’s office seems to be intent on undermining those efforts to the detriment of our customers,” the company said in a statement.

Tether and Bitfinex have long attracted suspicion within the crypto space and beyond. Tether has been accused of moving the market by printing new tokens. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that news of the investigation sent crypto prices down.

At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is down four percent over 24 hours, while Ethereum is down six percent. In fairness, given the scale of the alleged fraud, and involvement of a branch of the U.S. government, those losses seem quite minimal.

Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs are increasingly at risk of being left behind as cryptocurrency funds are the fastest growing segment of the hedge fund industry.

Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Are Growing the Fastest

A few months ago, Wall Street seemed to be embracing Bitcoin, and giants such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were developing infrastructures to trade Bitcoin. But then, after the value of digital coins collapsed last year, Wall Street top bosses got cold feet and shelved their projects.

Now, 2019 Bitcoin economic activity is hitting fresh highs and its value is rebounding. However, Wall Street is not reacting to seize the opportunity. The Street writes,

Yet giant U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of New York Mellon that dominate Wall Street trading in everything from bonds, stocks, commodities, and foreign exchanges are increasingly at risk of missing out due to their own reluctance to jump into the cryptocurrency market.

Wall Street executives’ excuses abound, ranging from lack of federal regulations to the potential of nefarious activities executed using cryptocurrencies.

Another Wall Street concern is regulators’ inertia. Several key initiatives that would help to trigger an explosive expansion of the crypto market have yet to receive regulatory approval.

Nevertheless, investors continue to inject money into the crypto market. Thus, spite the 2018 crypto winter, worldwide, the rate at which new crypto-related funds were launched increased. The Crypto Fund Research underlines, “We are on pace for a record 200+ new launches for 2018, including crypto hedge funds, crypto venture funds, and crypto private equity.”

Granted, financial instruments focusing on the nascent crypto assets market are still small. “All crypto funds combined make up less than 1% of total hedge fund assets,” according to a Crypto Fund Research report, which specifies,

There are currently more than 700 cryptocurrency/blockchain investment funds. The majority are set up as hedge venture capital funds, while a large number are hedge funds or hybrid funds. There are also a handful of crypto ETFs and crypto private equity funds.

The United States is the country were most crypto funds have been launched. However, the launching of new crypto funds is also increasingly occurring in Europe, Asia, offshore (Cayman Islands), and Mexico. See the comprehensive list of crypto fund launches here.

The Crypto Fund Research report concludes,

Crypto hedge funds are the fastest growing segment of the hedge fund industry.

Moreover, crypto assets under management continue to grow, as the graph below shows:

Bitcoin-Based Startups Are Springing Up

On the other hand, smaller but visionary companies continue creating new Bitcoin-related solutions.

For instance, Coinbase is now launching a solution that offers financial investors the opportunity to earn interest on specific cryptocurrencies they hold.

Additionally, Square is searching for talent to staff teams that will work on the crypto space. To attract candidates, Square offers to pay developers and crypto engineers in bitcoin.

Moreover, help to increase the growth of the overall crypto market might indirectly come from social media giant Facebook. In effect, Facebook is reportedly planning to use cryptocurrency technology to transfer money via Whatsapp.

Ross Sandler, an internet analyst at Barclays, Facebook believes Facebook’s cryptocurrency “could be part of a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. According to CNBC,

Sandler forecasted as much as $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021 from ‘Facebook Coin.’ Conservatively, the firm sees a base-case of an incremental $3 billion in revenue from a successful cryptocurrency implementation.

The Indian government has been progressing on cryptocurrency regulation. A recent report from the Ministry of Finance confirms some recommendations. Meanwhile, local media reported Friday that a draft bill on the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is being circulated among relevant government departments.

Ministry of Finance’s Confirmation

The Ministry of Finance recently published a summary report of the government’s activities in 2018. “An inter-ministerial committee under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs with representatives from concerned departments has been constituted for considering all aspects related to virtual currencies and crypto assets,” the document begins to explain.

The Indian government was supposed to submit a report containing the legal framework for cryptocurrency to the supreme court in March but the court adjourned without addressing the matter. The next hearing date is July 23 and the community expects this matter to be addressed at that time. The Ministry of Finance’s report reads:

Various options for treating virtual currencies and crypto assets including banning/regulating are being examined by the committee.

India Working With FATF

The report also reveals that India’s Department of Revenue has been working with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on various aspects including cryptocurrency. India is a member of the FATF, an international body which sets standards and promotes the implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering and terrorist financing globally.

The Department of Economic Affairs used to work with the FATF but the work was transferred to the Department of Revenue per Gazette Notification dated Nov. 9, 2017, the Finance Ministry detailed, noting:

Department of Revenue has been actively involved in the working papers being developed by the FATF on various issues (such as virtual currency, proliferation financing among) which will act as guidance for the member countries.

FATF’s Recommendations

The G20 countries, including India, have reaffirmed their support for the FATF as “the global anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, and proliferation financing standard-setting body,” according to the FAFT report submitted to the G20 this month. The G20 also asked the FATF to clarify how its standards apply to virtual asset activities. Among other recommendations, the FATF replied:

Jurisdictions should apply a risk-based approach to virtual assets, virtual asset financial activities, and virtual asset service providers.

The FATF further stated that it will update the “Risk-based Approach Guidance on Virtual Currencies” by June for the G20 summit. This approach will assist “jurisdictions and the private sector, in implementing a risk-based approach to regulating virtual asset service providers, including their supervision and monitoring,” the FATF wrote.

Rumor of a Ban Recommendation

Local media reported Friday that the Indian government is in the process of discussing a draft bill on cryptocurrency. The Economic Times claims to have reviewed the minutes of a meeting of the government committee which includes representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs, the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority.

According to the publication, the minutes showed that the ministries were “of the view that already there is a lot of delay in taking action against cryptocurrency. There is an urgent need to ban [the] sale, purchase and issuance of cryptocurrency.”

An unnamed government official claiming to know the details told the news outlet that the draft bill entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019” has been circulated to relevant government departments for discussion. The publication, however, did not explain the “Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” part. In addition to this being a draft bill and information was based on anonymous sources, the news outlet emphasized that based on the feedback:

A final law will be proposed to the next government that takes charge after elections at the end of May.

This is also not the first time the media have reported that the Indian government is considering banning cryptocurrency based on anonymous sources. In December last year, Cnbc TV18 reported on a ban recommendation. However, another media outlet reported soon afterward that there was also a recommendation to legalize cryptocurrency with strong riders, leaving the public confused about what the recommendations actually were.

SBIVC exchange, launched by Tokyo-based financial services giant SBI Holdings, reportedly recorded a profit before tax of almost 360 million Japanese yen ($3.2 million) for the full fiscal year from April 2018 to March 31, 2019.

SBI also made a number of major announcements in its new financial report. As such, SBI revealed that it is considering the launch of a security token offering (STO) later this year, adding that the firm is awaiting the revision of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which is scheduled for June 2019.

As well, SBI said it is planning to continue to expand its recently established crypto mining arm SBI Mining Chip (SBIMC), expecting to see an increase of the mining hash rate.

In addition, SBI said it will continue to strengthen its relationship with its major crypto partner Ripple, the firm behind the third-largest crypto by market cap XRP. Particularly, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and representative director SBI, has been recently appointed as an executive of Ripple Labs and noted his desire for the two entities to work together.

First announced in April 2018, SBI Virtual Currencies was registered as a business in late 2017, according to data from SBI’s new financial report. As the report notes, SBI Virtual Currencies went live in June 2018 with a limited amount of orders, while account registration started in July 2018.

As previously reported, SBI Virtual Currencies initially supported major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP and bitcoin cash (BCH). In mid-April, the exchange officially announced its plans to delist bitcoin cash. Subsequently, SBI executives clarified that the removal of BCH from the exchange was not a result of other deslistings involving bitcoin SV (BSV) — a controversial hard fork of BCH — by a number of non-Japanese exchanges.",,https://www.coindesk.com/new-crypto-mining-malware-targeting-asian-firms-with-nsa-tools,"A new form of malware is targeting enterprises in Asia to mine monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.

Cybersecurity software provider Symantec published the news in a blog post Wednesday, saying that over 80 percent of victims are located in China, with nations such as South Korea, Japan and Vietnam also seeing activity.

Dubbed “Beapy,” the malicious code is a file-based crypto miner, not a browser-based one, the firm said. It works by sending a malicious Excel file to victims as an email attachment, downloading the DoublePulsar backdoor onto the victim’s system if the file is opened.

DoublePulsar (notably developed by the U.S. National Security Agency before it was stolen then released to the public in 2017) was also used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, according to the post.

Once DoublePulsar is installed on to a victim’s machine, the miner is downloaded. At the same time, it uses another leaked NSA tool, EternalBlue, to propagate across the infected network via unpatched computers where it can steal credentials to further access patched machines.

Cryptojacking malware can have a major impact on enterprises, Symantec said, including slowing down device performance, reducing employee productivity and increasing costs.

Although cryptojacking activity has decreased by about 52 percent over the last year, it is still an area of interest among hackers which largely target businesses.

Symantec said:

“Looking at the overall figures for cryptojacking, we can see that there were just under 3 million cryptojacking attempts in March 2019. While a big drop from the peak of February 2018, when there were 8 million cryptojacking attempts, it is still a significant figure.”

The firm said it first noticed Beapy in January of this year, but activity has increased since early March.

Monero’s privacy features make it by far the most popular cryptocurrency among hackers deploying mining malware. A recent academic study estimated that cybercriminals have mined around 5 percent of the total monero in circulation.

Earlier this year, researchers at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks discovered a form of malware that takes administrative control to first uninstall cloud security products and then injects code to mine monero. The same team also discovered another variant that steals browser cookies and other information on Apple Mac computers to directly steal cryptocurrencies.

The law will enter into force next week. Crypto service providers will need to register with the country’s Financial Supervisory Authority and meet statutory requirements.

Finland Approves Crypto Law

Finland’s Ministry of Finance announced Friday that the president of the country has approved the Act on Virtual Currency Providers. The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fin-FSA), responsible for regulating Finland’s financial markets, independently announced Friday:

The Act on Virtual Currency Providers enters into force on 1 May. In accordance with the act, the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fin-FSA) will act as the registration authority and supervisory authority for virtual currency providers.

Registration Requirements

The Fin-FSA explained that registration is required for “virtual currency exchange services,” “custodian wallet providers,” and “issuers of virtual currencies.” These providers must comply with statutory requirements. For example, they must be reliable and able to hold and protect client money. They must also segregate client money from their own funds and comply with AML and CFT regulations.

The Finnish financial watchdog elaborated:

Going forward, only virtual currency providers meeting statutory requirements are able to carry on their activities in Finland. Virtual currency providers which do not comply with statutory requirements will be prohibited from continuing their business activities, enforced by a conditional fine.

The law has a transitional provision which allows existing crypto service providers to continue to operate in the country without registration until Nov. 1. The Fin-FSA will hold a briefing on May 15 at the Bank of Finland to explain the new rules to both existing crypto service providers and those planning to start offering related services.

Complying With EU’s Legislation

The Fin-FSA noted that these new requirements are based on the May 2018 amendments to the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (the Fifth Money Laundering Directive), adding:

All EU member states must include services related to virtual currencies within the scope of AML/CFT legislation by 10 January 2020.

Further, registration with the Fin-FSA does not allow the service provider to operate in another EU country as each member state has its own law that must be followed.

Prior to the president approving the law, Helsinki-based crypto marketplace Localbitcoins announced that it had been working on improvement measures to conform to the new regulation and had launched “a new account registration process where users can verify basic information already during sign-up.”

Similar stories have already emanated from the likes of Facebook and JPMorgan Chase, with analysts speculating on various use cases for these cryptocurrency tokens.

While not yet confirmed officially, a “Samsung Coin” could find application as a payment means on the company’s app store and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. The company has revealed that its flagship Galaxy S10 smartphone will have a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.

With these mega-corporations delving into the blockchain scene, it is perhaps important to see how their virtual currency implementation compares with each other and the rest of the virtual currency ecosystem.

Samsung readies new ETH-based blockchain mainnet and cryptocurrency token

On Wednesday (April 24, 2019), an inside source within Samsung revealed that the company’s blockchain division was developing an Ethereum-based blockchain mainnet. According to the source, the project would also create a virtual asset dubbed “Samsung Coin.”

Currently, the Samsung hierarchy has offered no confirmation of the proposed blockchain mainnet and token. However, the reports appear to be consistent with the recent activities of the company in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology space.

Answering questions at the Blockchain Expo in London on Thursday (April 25, 2019), the business development and fintech chief at Samsung SDS Europe, Moritz von Widekind, said the company hadn’t decided on anything concrete yet.

According to the Samsung executive, various departments within the company are working on the project. Von Widekind also added that the proposed token could be launched on the company’s NextLedger enterprise blockchain platform.

Samsung recently participated in a $4 million investment round for ZenGo — a smartphone cryptocurrency wallet app. NextLedger continues to receive significant interest from companies around the world, most recently by Indian IT behemoth Mahindra.

In the absence of an official word from Samsung, it is impossible to know for certain the way in which the rumored token would work. However, given the electronic giant’s business model, there are some plausible assumptions to be made.

Samsung Coin could be used as a payment token within the company’s payment app, Samsung Pay. The token may also be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges across the market.

Like the proposed Facebook Coin, no one can know for sure how the “tokenomics” of the cryptocurrency would work. If it turns out to be a payment coin, can it compete with the likes of bitcoin?

Facebook making another play at a payment system

Back in December 2018, Cointelegraph began reporting that Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world, was looking to launch its own in-app virtual currency. Like Samsung Coin, there isn’t any official word on what form of crypto-related project could best describe the Facebook Coin (FB Coin).

Some analysts and commentators say FB Coin will be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and used for money transfers within the platform’s apps. Such a move could potentially be a huge deal in the cross-border remittance market.

According to the World Payment Report (WPR) of 2018, global mobile money transactions topped $41 billion in 2016. This figure formed more than 8% of all noncash transactions, showing the growing appeal of e-wallet transactions.

The WPR study also showed that large tech firms like Google, Facebook and Tencent accounted for more than 70% of the global money transfer market as far back as 2016. An excerpt from the report reads:

“These companies are leveraging their large-platform user base to make an impact in the payments space, focusing on providing seamless user experience, value-added features, and making use of network effects. Incumbents should learn from the BigTechs and invest in technology platforms in order to compete with them.”

The proposed FB Coin isn’t the company’s first foray into the digital currency scene. Back in 2011-2012, the social media giant launched FacebookCredits and Facebook Gifts.

However, the company discontinued the FacebookCredits service in 2012. The company did launch a peer-to-peer (p2p) payments service for the Messenger platform in 2015 but recently announced that it would also be shutting it down.

Some commentators even identified Facebook’s decision to discontinue the Messenger payment service as a clear indication of the imminent launch of its cryptocurrency token. Earlier in April, Nathaniel Propper of The New York Times declared that Facebook was on the hunt for $1 billion in venture capital funding for the proposed token.

According to Propper’s Twitter account:

“One person I spoke with said that Facebook is talking about using the money as collateral for its cryptocurrency. Facebook has been designing the coin to keep a stable value, pegged to a basket of foreign currencies held in bank accounts.”

Has blockchain technology finally helped Facebook crack the code for establishing a functioning digital payment system? Does the social media giant now possess the requisite expertise to run a remittance platform or is FB Coin going to find some other user outside the payment arena? Only time will tell.

Consumer use case for private blockchain cryptocurrencies

In mid-February 2019, Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase announced its own cryptocurrency, becoming the first United States bank to adopt virtual currency in business operations. According to the bank, JPM Coin will run on Quorom, an Ethereum-powered private blockchain.

Unlike FB Coin, a lot is known about the plans JPMorgan Chase has for its cryptocurrency. JPM Coin, which is a stablecoin, will first be deployed in the bank’s internal settlement protocols to increase the efficiency of the overall process.

Right off the bat, some commentators expressed the position that JPM Coin could challenge bitcoin and XRP in the payment arena. However, by even JPMorgan Chase’s own submission, the adoption of JPM Coin will be restricted to its large corporate clients.

There are, however, future plans to move the utilization of JPM Coin beyond the internal transactional paradigm in use at JPMorgan Chase. An excerpt from the project’s FAQ reads:

“Over time, JPM Coin will be extended to other major currencies. The product and technology capabilities are currency agnostic.”

On Thursday (April 25, 2019), Cointelegraph also reported that footwear giant Nike is looking to launch its own cryptocurrency. Nike has reportedly filed a trademark with the U.S. Patent Office for “Cryptokicks.”

An examination of the filing document shows Cryptokicks being described using language that points to its being some form of cryptocurrency or digital payment system.

The democratization of payments on the global level is one of the foundational principles of bitcoin and blockchain-based currencies in general. Thus, the question of how the cryptocurrency tokens being created by these companies fits into such a philosophy is becoming pertinent.

According to Jerry Brito of Coin Center, these companies are creating in-house payment systems and are pale imitations of real cryptos like bitcoin. Commenting back in February, Brito opined:

“There’s a lot of confusion. [...] I see folks referring to it as a cryptocurrency. It’s not a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is one that is open and permissionless. If you want to download it, you don’t need permission, you just need some software.”

Some critics suppose there is no decentralization and label such efforts as being akin to companies that hedged their bets with the private intranet being more successful than the public internet in the 1990s. Just as the public internet became more popular and more successful than enterprise intranet protocols, some critics say permissioned blockchains will end up playing second fiddle to their public, permissionless counterparts.

Samsung could well be aware of this notion and would perhaps be more amenable to accepting a hybrid enterprise blockchain than a purely permissioned one. Cointelegraph contacted Samsung for further comments on the matter, but hasn’t received any as of press time.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-burst-of-the-bitcoin-bubble-an-autopsy,"Marcello Minenna is the director of the quantitative analysis and financial innovation unit in Consob (Italian Companies and Exchange Commission), —Italian government’s authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market — as well as an adjunct professor of stochastic finance at the London Graduate School of Mathematical Finance and at Luigi Bocconi University of Milan. He is an economic and financial columnist featured on leading Italian and international publications.

The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Sixteen months after from a peak value of $19,100, bitcoin is now hovering around $5,000. Despite its wide distance from the historical maximum, today’s price is good news for the market, as the recent rise could be the end of the collapse produced by the violent explosion of the digital currency bubble in 2018. From December 2017, the price of every digital asset has fallen, on average, 80%; for bitcoin, it has been the second collapse ever recorded, a violent fall even for an unconventional asset that has historically shown very marked boom-and-bust cycles. In 2011, the price declined by 93% — to $2 from a maximum of $39 — while in 2013, in just a few weeks, the price exploded to $1,151 to decline later to $177 over a 12-month period.

It is not certain that, this time, the bottom has been touched, despite the encouraging developments of the last weeks: Historically, the phase of rapid decline is followed by a stagnation of the price that can even last years, named in jargon as a ""crypto winter.""

In the context of a widespread speculative bubble that the so-called “altcoins” have turned out to be, apart from any technical evaluation, simple variants more volatile and less liquid than bitcoin, almost perfectly correlated with each other. This feature made any attempt to diversify the risk between different crypto-assets futile.

Among altcoins, a specific mention should go to Ethereum; this is the digital currency classified as second in terms of capitalization that has been exploited as a technical platform for the proliferation of the initial coin offerings (ICOs). These ICOs have been exploited to cover real public purchase offers by collecting financial resources sheltered from regulators and by financing dubiously weak or shady projects. Most of these initiatives have invariably destroyed economic resources or turned out to be real scams in which investors' defensive capabilities were substantially nullified.

Ex-post, the price pattern during the bitcoin bubble closely followed the asymmetric behavior of its historical cousins, starting with the Tulipan bubble of 1637, passing through that of the South Sea Company up to the most recent burst of the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000.

After a phase of moderate rise, a very rapid manic phase of vertical price growth of about nine months followed, with a final buying hysteria in December 2017 — the month in which the price more than doubled, starting from an already very high base. The summit was touched with a classic ""double peak"" in January 2018, synchronized — not surprisingly — with the achievement of the maxima on global stock markets and with the peak of liquidity released into the global economy by the main central banks. Since then, the price of bitcoin has had an almost uninterrupted decline, with very rapid collapses, and shorter and less convincing recoveries, with descending relative maxima.

What is the floor of this incredible descent?

On the subject, we must consider that bitcoin, its clones and the rest of the digital currencies do not have their own intrinsic value. Prices are simply determined by the intersection of demand and supply on individual exchange markets; these are often highly illiquid prices, differing from each other by hundreds of euros without effective arbitrage between the various markets due to the structural limits of bitcoin and settlement platforms. Therefore, it is very difficult to think of determining what the fair value could be.

Often for traders operating on these markets, the technical analysis is the only tool for interpreting price movements. This paradoxically means that the price dynamic, determined by the collective actions of the traders, sometimes follows the forecasting patterns of the technical analysis.

Under this overall picture, it is worth trying to isolate the main drivers of the rise and fall of bitcoin and other altcoins. The role played by the stablecoin tether has been predominant in the phase of the rapid price increase between March and December 2017.

A stablecoin is a digital currency anchored with a fixed exchange rate to a fiat currency traded on the forex market, such as the dollar or the euro. Its existence is justified by the fact that, at present, the conversion between fiat and digital currencies is still slow and cumbersome, given that it requires a funds transfer from traditional banks to crypto exchanges via cross-border banks’ payment systems, whose settlement may require several days.

The conversion between digital currencies is instead instantaneous and allows traders to protect themselves by using stablecoins from the very high volatility of bitcoin’s and altcoins’ prices. Of course, 1 tether is not equivalent to $1 because it cannot be freely converted, although the company itself has always declared to hold a reserve of dollars corresponding to the quantity of tether issued and circulating on the exchanges. However, for traders, tether performs the same function of the dollar, so it is irrelevant whether there is or is not full or partial convertibility.

In April 2019, there are at least eight different stablecoins on the market offering the same tether service, but in 2017, tether substantially managed a monopoly that heavily influenced the price trend on the various exchanges, as evidenced by a statistical analysis made by the University of Austin, Texas. What’s happened has a lot to do with the fact that the company that issued tether was de facto controlled by the largest crypto exchange in Asia, Bitfinex.

By examining the data (see figures above) we can observe how the price behavior of bitcoin (and of the other altcoins) in the “pump” phase of the bubble is perfectly correlated with the issuing of new tether on the exchanges. As the aforementioned research shows, it is statistically probable that the Bitfinex exchange has artificially fueled the manic buying of digital currencies through the issuing of increasing amounts of tether. In a phase of exponential price rise, the issuing of tether without adequate coverage in dollars is a profitable strategy. In fact, speculators could buy digital currencies with newly minted tether, counting on being able to resell them at a higher price later and replenish the dollar reserves. The signal of strong price increases in increasingly accelerated times contributed to the growth of the media hype on digital currencies, which attracted retail investors with little experience in digital assets, often unaware of the enormous risks related to the terminal phase of a speculative bubble.

The long price contraction, perhaps not yet completed despite the recent recovery in prices, was caused by two main factors operating in two distinct time phases. Between January and April 2018, the decline was demand-driven and therefore determined by the flight of frightened speculative investors, highly exposed to losses due to the purchases made at very high prices. In this classic panic-selling, it can be noted that the support of a growing issue of tether was also lacking on the exchanges. In fact, since February, the growth of tether in circulation has slowed down and flattened out; this is indicative of the fact that, in a declining market, the strategy of issuing uncovered tether was no longer profitable.

In June 2018, the price apparently found a floor at around $6,000, a level still over 10 times greater than the price that bitcoin had at the beginning of 2017. At this point, the majority of speculative investors has already disappeared, and the volatility of digital currencies was drastically reduced as trades gradually became thinner (see figure below). Many analysts believed that, at this stage, $6,000 was the minimum level necessary to offset the energy costs of the miners that were digitally ""coining"" the new crypto assets. Until then, the need of a widening population of miners to catch cover rising production costs was a force that supported the price growth of digital assets.

However, this fragile balance did not hold. In November 2018, the announcement of another hard fork between digital currencies that aimed to coin a new bitcoin clone without substantial innovations caused a price earthquake that broke the fragile equilibrium achieved. In this deteriorating framework, the determining factor of the price decline seemed to be offer-driven and related to the digital currencies mining community. In fact, a substantial share of miners abruptly shifted its computing power (or hash rate) from bitcoin toward clone-currencies in the hope to reap risk-free profits from the blockchain fork, as already happened several times in the ascending phase of the bubble.

But at the end of 2018, things were changing: The anomalous shift in computing power took away support for bitcoin and dragged the price of digital assets in a downward spiral, including the clone currencies on which the miners had heavily invested. As a consequence, a part of the miners, which was already operating at a loss before this downturn, has been thrown out of the market, causing — for the first time ever — a decline of the overall computing power of the bitcoin network, which collapsed by 50% in just a few weeks (see figure below). In this short period of time, bitcoin and the altcoins went in a free-fall never experienced in the demand-driven phase of the bursting of the bubble, suffering losses in the order of 70%.

In 2019, the ""Darwinian selection"" of miners seems to have stopped, as testified by the recovery of the overall network hash rate — albeit at a more moderate rate. The bitcoin protocol provides an automatic mechanism of autoregulation such that the cost of currency’s mining tends to fall in the face of a decline in the network computing power. This periodic adjustment allows marginal operators to return to the market at lower costs.

In the early months of the year, cryptocurrencies slowly regained value, but the real surprise came on April 2, when, in just one hour, bitcoin spiked by almost $1,000, surpassing $5,000 — a new resistance that has basically held up over the weeks since.

It is not clear what the reason for this jump was (perhaps an algorithmically generated order or a liquidity squeeze connected to bitcoin derivatives followed by a forced buy-in on market makers’ quotes). After all, recently, various analysts had forecast a surge in the short term, and knowing the trigger event matters little. The real question is whether the market is heading back into bull mode. Multiple factors support an affirmative answer: the gradual recovery of the market capitalization of some stablecoins — tether first (see figure below) — the wear of the resources available to the bears, the albeit moderate return of various central banks to an accommodating monetary policy and the uncertainty linked to relevant phenomena on a global scale (the Libyan crisis, trade tensions, the Brexit conundrum and forthcoming European Union elections) that increases the appeal of digital currencies.

2019 could prove to be a new starting point for digital currencies, given the slow recovery of investors’ interest. Investments in technological innovation and infrastructure have never stopped, and the interests of institutional investors go beyond the short-term speculative frenzy. Regulators are also gradually intervening in the reorganization of these frontier markets. The crypto winter may be less long than expected.",,https://www.ccn.com/cheapair-bitcoin-clearing-5-million-in-5-years/,"

Hegley said:

We identified an increasing demand from our clients for the option to pay in bitcoin for business travel bookings made by our travel consultants. We chose BitPay to manage our merchant processing because they make it easy and handle the entire process of getting the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash from the customer and depositing cash into our account.

In an emerging industry like crypto, for long-term growth, first mover advantage is crucial. Both businesses and blockchain projects that emerged from 2013 to 2014 have thrived throughout the past five years by developing a strong brand image.

As the usage of cryptocurrencies increases over the long run, cryptocurrency users are likely to spend digital assets on platforms with dedicated teams in facilitating cryptocurrency payments and that are understanding of the technological limitations of the blockchain, especially when it comes to scalability.

We are now multiple years into ""the dawn of highly scalable and secure blockchains"". Some exceptions, but here's what we have to show for it: – overpromising

– underdelivering

– extreme delays

– unrealistic expectations

– fundamental problems unsolved I'm just being honest. — Spencer Noon (@spencernoon) April 25, 2019

Muneeb Ali, the CEO of Blockstack PBC, a company that received an investment from affiliates of the Harvard Endowment to launch the first U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered token sale, said that blockchains, by nature, do not scale.

“Blockchains don’t scale. Period. The limits are physical bandwidth and laws of physics (not going to change). The only realistic approach is to do less at the blockchain layer. The entire ‘world computer’ idea is flawed,” he said.

As such, until blockchain protocols evolve to a point in which second-layer solutions are well established and used, it will be difficult for large-scale conglomerates to widely adopt cryptocurrencies for payments.

CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee emphasized that the company’s dedicated crypto payments team has continued to learn about crypto and blockchain technology to efficiently clear cryptocurrency payments in the future.

Why Go the Extra Mile to Process Cryptocurrency Payments?

When the bitcoin price achieved an all-time high at $20,000 and the network was overloaded with transactions, the mempool, a space within the Bitcoin blockchain used to store temporary transactions for miners to process, clogged up.

It delayed transactions, sometimes up to 24 hours, pressuring some users to use higher fees to get miners to prioritize their transactions.

Companies could see the so-called “fee market” as an issue as the market recovers and the usage of cryptocurrencies rises by exploring various ways to do so.

Hence, it is necessary for companies like CheapAir that are committed to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to have a dedicated team to clear cryptocurrency payments.

But, it is not cheap to have an entire team working on a cryptocurrency payment infrastructure at all times to process $5 million in volume over several years, which is low relative to the total payment volume of travel agencies.

For any company that integrates bitcoin at the current juncture, it is a long-term bet that the asset class will ultimately survive and will see explosive growth in usage. When crypto grows, firms like CheapAir that allocated resources to become a first mover in the industry will likely see the benefits over the years to come.",2019-04-27 13:25:24+00:00,https://bitcoinist.com/how-legit-are-bitcoin-lotteries-really/,"Bitcoin Gambling How Legit Are Bitcoin Lotteries, Really?

Some websites have begun offering Bitcoin lotteries. If you’re thinking about trying your luck with them, here are some things to know first.

The Legality Varies Based on Where You Live

Bitcoin is still largely unregulated. However, many countries started setting rules to regulate Bitcoin gambling, including lotteries. It’s smart to see what the laws in your country are before getting started.

Look for Bitcoin Lotteries Offered By Regulated Gambling Sites

Prior to entering a Bitcoin lottery, read the website’s fine print and determine whether you’re dealing with a regulated provider. If so, that means the site must follow the gambling regulations of the respective company, and it might give you some recourse if something goes wrong when attempting to collect winnings.

One of the questions most often on people’s minds is whether Bitcoin lotteries are legitimate. You’ll have better luck finding a regulated one if you look for regulated providers. Keep in mind, though, that many Bitcoin gambling sites get regulated in Curaçao, a place with looser regulations than many other nations.

A Bitcoin lottery site called Kibo Lotto took that approach in late 2018. Crypto-Games.net also operates a lottery site that appears to have ties to Curaçao based on a logo in the site’s footer, as does Bitplay Club. One potential advantage to Bitplay Club is that it promises “provably fair” games through algorithms that show transparency.

There are also sites, like Yet Another Bitcoin Lottery (YABTCL) with no indication of regulation. Playing there arguably raises the risks.

Most Bitcoin Lotto Games Have Familiar Instructions

In states that have traditional lottery programs, such as Virginia, it’s easy to find databases that give people the information they need to know to start playing.

For example, Virginian adults can play daily lotto games, as well as jackpot games. There are also instant-win games, such as scratcher cards. Most of the Bitcoin lottery sites provide similar offerings. So, you shouldn’t need to spend much time learning how to play.

Lottoland Launches World’s First Regulated Bitcoin Lottery

In 2017, a gambling site called Lottoland attracted attention for creating what it advertised as the first regulated Bitcoin jackpot. When playing the Pick 6 game offered at Lottoland, people have a 1-in-7 chance of winning a prize. The system set up there is a good example of a well-known lottery game structure. People mark their chosen numbers on an electronic ticket.

Few Long Established Sites

While researching Bitcoin lottery sites, it becomes clear they often don’t have staying power. Three sites mentioned in media sources (BTCFreeLotto.com, 10XBTC and World Super Lotto) have since stopped operating. Similarly, Kibo Lotto, the site mentioned earlier, is still in the coming-soon stage according to its website.

There’s also a mobile lottery ticket app site called Jackpocket that reportedly started offering Bitcoin as a method of paying for lottery tickets in 2016. However, there are no newer mentions of that option in the media or within the Jackpocket homepage or help database. In that case, Jackpocket itself is more established but seems to have moved away from dealing with Bitcoin.

Play With Caution

The information here emphasizes why you should be exceptionally careful when playing Bitcoin lotteries. Plus, watch out for related social media posts. In one recent incident, hackers took over the official Twitter feed of the South African cricket board and used it to try and interest people in a Bitcoin lottery.

Lotteries require people to weigh the risks with the possible rewards, and doing that is especially necessary with the Bitcoin varieties.

On April 26, software developer Tobias Ruck revealed a new platform he’s been working on called SLP Agora, an onchain trading console written in Rust that allows users to auction SLP tokens for bitcoin cash. The application’s decision-based transactions are secured by a smart contract technique enabled by the newly implemented opcode OP_Checkdatasig.

SLP Agora Enables Token Auctions Onchain

The Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), a system that allows token creation on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network, has become extremely popular. Lots of people have been creating tokens and some of them are being sold on exchanges and even used by the micronation of Liberland. Now the software engineer Tobias Ruck has released a new SLP application called SLP Agora, a platform that allows for onchain token auctions. The open source platform uses smart contracts to perform the actions using the OP_Checkdatasig opcode that was added to the BCH network last November. According to Ruck, the application is built with the programming language Rust and uses a “nifty trick” outlined by the software developer Tendo Pein.

“SLP Agora is a simple trading platform written in Rust where you can put your favourite tokens up for auction — all on the BCH blockchain,” Ruck explained on Friday.

In addition to the release of the early version of SLP Agora, Ruck also hosted a live stream in order to show other BCH developers and the community how the market works. People can also try SLP Agora out by downloading the EXE files for Windows or build the application on another operating system using the source code. “So far, it’s only an interactive console application (not pretty but easy to use), however, I hope there will be enough interest and support in the community that we’re able to build a nice intuitive web interface and create an extensible protocol,” Ruck remarked.

Revolutionizing Smart Contracts With OP_Checkdatasig

Ruck also warned that there may be a couple of bugs because the application is so new and noted that people should only use small fractions of funds at the moment. The developer also emphasized that even though the project is experimental, in operation it’s proven to be “surprisingly flawless.” Ruck also noted that because of the underlying nature of the Simple Ledger Protocol, users can only place sell orders, but not buy orders. The project’s creator also placed a few sell orders for the “incredibly useful Tobi’s Terrific Trading Token (TTTT)” on the platform so people can test the platform.

The opcode OP_Checkdatasig has been heralded by many developers for being able to make the BCH protocol’s Script language more robust. So far the BCH community has witnessed some incredible achievements by developers using OP_Checkdatasig. Just recently, the engineer Karol Trzeszczkowski launched a platform called the Last Will, a smart contract program for the inheritance of bitcoin cash using the opcode. SLP developers recently published the Cashy toolbox which makes use of OP_Checkdatasig.

The upcoming service Bitcoin.com Oracle will be using the benefits of the opcode in order to provide verifiable multi-sourced facts. Last November, Ruck also showcased how the new Bitcoin Cash opcode makes an onchain game of Chess possible. Ruck has continued to build with the OP_Checkdatasig opcode and the BCH community seems pleased with the results.

__",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/04/146881-satire-site-coin-jazeera-now-ridiculing-cryptocurrency-reporting-and-culture/,"A dedicated ne ws satire site has been making quick work of arguably dubious cryptocurrency products, personages and news sites since its launch three weeks ago.

“CoinJazeera, The Realest News in Crypto” publishes content by an anonymous writer or writers and is also seeking submissions and tips.

The site is designed to resemble a “real” online crypto news publication except all the features are mock.

Where a banner ad might appear on a “real” news site, on CoinJazeera there’s a banner ad that reads, “BUY THIS HOT AD SPACE We’re ready to sell out. [email protected]”

Writers at CoinJazeera show an intimate knowledge of “the space,” as it were, and the unifying perspective displayed by articles seems to be that of a classic Bitcoiner with a healthy distaste for the rampant greed and incompetence that have all but overcome “Satoshi’s vision.”

Choice CoinJazeera headlines include:

“(Ethereum’s) Vlad Zamfir Looking for New Drugs to Help With Sharding Ideas”

“John McAfee Building Cocaine Moonbase in Space to Flee

“Binance Chain: CZ’s Final Scam”

The last headline refers to CZ Zhang and the exchange he founded, Binance, which is currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Binance has lately released its own cryptocurrency blockchain, and at least one project, a South Korean gifting platform called Gifto recently announced it was migrating from Ethereum to Binance chain because the latter, “better suits our aggressive plans for mainstream adoption; one where the real usage and growth of the Gifto ecosystem can be shown today without incurring massive fees or slow transaction times which negatively impact user experience.”

CoinJazeera makes bold, satirical assertions regarding what is really behind the meteoric success of CZ Zhang and Binance:

“Our reporters learned that the reason behind Binance’s unrivaled success in the Shitcoin Age of 2017 was through a mastery of the art of regulatory arbitrage. Regulatory arbitrage involves capitalizing on regulatory loopholes in order to circumvent unfavorable regulation. While US Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini, and even more legitimate ones including Poloniex and Bittrex were bent over and mercilessly gangbanged by FinCen, the IRS, and the SEC; Binance fled both Hong Kong and Japan and geographically relocated to the cliché island country of Malta. This allowed the company to avoid unfavorable regulations that would harm the customer experience, such as KYC checks for US customers that prevent popular features such as money laundering, market manipulation, and tax evasion. Binance customers would now be free to steal money with popular trading tactics including pump and dumps, price fixing, spoofing, front-running, and wash trading.”

Coin Jazeera jokes:

“In a stroke of machiavellian brilliance, Binance has repackaged the notorious money laundering tool, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), as the new and improved Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)…An IEO is when a morally ambiguous overseas exchange does a token sale, decentralizes investors money into their own coffers, and then immediately lists the token on their own platform. It is a revised form of the ICO financial product that solves the regulatory problems around selling unregistered securities to non-accredited investors. The IEO also guarantees an immediate top exchange listing upon launch of the coin. This is Chinese copy-and-improve at its best.”

Eric Voorhees, the vocal Libertarian founder of Shapeshift, a cryptocurrency hot wallet service that until recently allowed anonymous in-wallet crypto-to-crypto trades is also ridiculed at Coin Jazeera:

“Erik Voorhees, CEO of Swiss-based money laundering service ShapeShift AG, took the main stage at the Community Ethereum Development Conference, EDCON 2019, in Sydney, Australia to make a bold promise to the world: revolutionary disappointment…Back when we introduced KYC to our flagship product, ShapeShift.io, we saw in the optics that we really managed to piss off the majority of our users. We thought we could do better. We launched the useless FOX token to force people to KYC and AML and even launched a loyalty program with tiers so you could pick how badly you wanted to be schlonged.”

Arthur Hays, CEO of the Bitmex bitcoin derivatives trading platform, which allows users to make huge leveraged trades of bitcoins, is also ridiculed in what could be considered a racialized satirical depiction.

The graphics accompanying the article, “BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes REKTs Users with Big Black Block,” shows Hayes face superimposed on the body of a black man, presumably African, with a scarified torso.

The rest of the piece includes, for example, references to “The African God of Scam, Ian Balina,” an ICO-promoter and another of the few well-known black men in crypto.

Hayes is later depicted wielding “a black hammer” that is “girthy and thick, (and) is ribbed…for the wielders pleasure…” etc.

A mythical depiction of Hayes thereafter shows him wielding said hammer to “REK” (liquidate the holdings of) Bitmex users.

While the racialized depiction of Hayes can easily be regarded as clumsy and problematic, one could also argue that the exaggerated depiction of “hypermasculine blackness” used to portray Hayes is also designed to skewer the masculinist fantasies that seem to preoccupy many of the young men who comprise the majority of crypto culture.

It will be interesting to see if Coin Jazeera ever turns the critique on classic Bitcoiner culture itself, which has so far failed to publicly confront the fact that Bitcoin seems to have many features of a negative-sum Ponzi scheme.

Meanwhile, though Coin Jazeera may not be politically perfect, the outlet is a welcome respite in the sea of conflict-of-interest that crypto culture and business seem to ever risk drowning in.",2019-04-14,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/series-of-china-official-scams-where-victims-transfer-money-using-bitcoin,"SINGAPORE - Do not fall for scammers who impersonate officials from China and ask victims to transfer money using bitcoin machines, said the police in a fresh alert on Saturday (April 27).

This comes hot on the heels of recent cases of such scams, and after scam alert posters beside a bitcoin machine were torn down, according to a police statement.

Police were alerted to the case of vandalism at Tampines One mall on April 18 and officers from Bedok Police Division investigated the matter. They found that a 45-year-old man was believed to have removed the posters from the wall beside the bitcoin machine.

During follow-up investigations, the man revealed that he received a call from someone purporting to be a foreign law enforcement officer.

The ""officer"" claimed that the man was under investigation for a transnational crime.

The man was told to transfer a total of $1,000 on two occasions to an account using the bitcoin machine at Tampines One.

He added that he was directed by the ""officer"" to remove and dispose of the scam alert posters next to the machine.

The police are continuing investigations into the case.

While the police were carrying out ground inquiries at Tampines One, officers managed to prevent a 32-year-old man from falling for the scam.

They also stopped a 49-year-old man from making further money transfers to the scammers.

These two men received a call from a scammer who identified himself as foreign law enforcement officer.

The men were told that their bank accounts were used in ongoing investigations related to human organ trafficking in China.

They were instructed to transfer money using the bitcoin machine for verification purposes.

While officers managed to prevent the 32-year-old man from transferring any money, the 49-year-old man was in the midst of doing so when officers stopped him.

However, he later told the police that he had already transferred $16,350.

The police advised the public to take the following precautions if they receive unsolicited calls requesting that they surrender money to avoid criminal investigations:

- Ignore such calls and the caller's instructions.

No government agency in Singapore will demand payment over the telephone or other social messaging platforms, such as WeChat or Facebook, or demand that you surrender cash to unnamed people. They would also not ask for personal banking information, such as your Internet banking passwords.

Foreign residents who receive calls from people claiming to be police officers or government officials from your home country should call their embassy or high commission to verify the claims of the caller.

- Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on a website or to callers over the phone. Do not make any fund transfers on the instruction of such callers.

- Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act. Do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively.

Despite the cryptocurrency's drop in early Friday trading — a symptom of worries around the legitimacy of another digital currency called tether — it's going higher, and may even be in a bull market already, Lee tells CNBC.

""Last year was a terrible year for crypto, a massive bear market, and we published a piece this week just highlighting … 11 signs that historically only take place in a bull market. So I think the evidence is mounting that there's a bull market,"" Lee, who is managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Thursday on ""Futures Now.""

Of the 11 signs that the ""crypto winter"" is over, Lee's top bullish drivers for bitcoin have to do with blockchain, technical indicators and trading volumes.

The first sign came in January, when Lee's team noticed that trading volumes on the blockchain — a technology some use to buy and sell bitcoin — turned positive year over year. That boost was helped by turmoil in Venezuela and Turkey, where people losing faith in their countries' currencies may have turned to bitcoin as an alternative, Lee explained.

""Just taking those two countries, they're close to 30% of the increase in on-chain activity, so it's meaningful,"" he said. ""People are saying, 'Look, I don't trust using these local currencies. I don't trust the banks. I'm going to start using bitcoin.' And that's what's causing on-chain volume to really take off.""

The second sign came in April, when bitcoin closed above its 200-day moving average, a widely accepted technical indicator of bullish momentum.

The third sign stemmed from a Fundstrat survey of over-the-counter brokers, who Lee said are ""really important in terms of how institutional investors trade crypto."" They told the firm that activity levels based on number of clients saw a 60% to 70% increase, and that trading per client surged.

""I think you're seeing signs that fundamentals are improving, technicals are improving, and now there's real activity by, essentially, crypto hodlers,"" Lee said, using an industry term that refers to people who hold cryptocurrencies rather than trading or selling them.

Lee's eight other bullish signs include shrinking supply; a swing to the positive in Fundstrat's Bitcoin Misery Index; consensus among ""original"" bitcoin bulls that the bottom has been put in for bitcoin; and a recent ""golden cross"" for bitcoin, or when the 50-day moving average overtakes the 200-day.

All this, he said, goes to show that bitcoin's not done climbing, and that these catalysts are ""likely"" to drive it to new all-time highs ""around"" 2020.

Lee, who predicted a 2019 bull market for bitcoin in March, added that the cryptocurrency's standard deviation from the S&P 500 — which this year is about 2.5 — could also help push it higher.

""One thing to keep in mind is whenever the S&P has made a big move, ... it's almost always led to a big move in crypto later in the year,"" he said. ""So I think … a 2.5 standard deviation move for bitcoin would take it to $14,000. I'm not saying that's where it's going to go, but that's the magnitude of move that would be a catch-up.""

Bitcoin traded in a wide range Friday on account of weakness in the broader cryptocurrency market, settling in roughly the $5,100 per coin range. Lee noted in a Friday call with CNBC that tether's issues don't have ""much effect on bitcoin,"" since most people are ""long tether because [they] don't want to be long bitcoin.""",2019-04-28,https://dailyhodl.com/2019/04/28/cryptos-complex-flow-makes-bitcoin-ethereum-and-litecoin-tougher-to-use-than-paypal/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post

Much attention is given to scaling blockchains on a technical level – more specifically, the ways in which they can be upgraded or improved to store more transactions and accommodate more users as the systems grow. But if users don’t feel confident, safe and comfortable using cryptocurrency, will that even matter?

A recent survey of crypto holders found that 75% felt less than completely confident that their transactions would go as planned. 55% had one or more problems when sending crypto including those who had a complete irreversible loss of funds.

Much effort has been expended in overcoming the scalability issues faced by blockchains, however, considerably less effort has gone into making cryptocurrencies easier to use in the first place.

It’s difficult to refute claims that the underlying technology is slow, cumbersome, risky to use and comes with a steep learning curve. To the non tech-savvy, the system is unintuitive and still too technical – even in some of the most popular wallets.

Consider the typical transaction flow – a sender must query the receiver for a complex and lengthy public address when they wish to make a transaction, before pasting it into their wallet software, setting the mining fees and waiting for the transaction to be included in a block. Their illegibility means that they are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

A popular form of malware is designed to modify clipboard data, and other man-in-the-middle attacks are all-too-prevalent. Some argue that is why QR codes should always be used to capture a public address. But QR codes only work if the user is physically present with an interface to the counter party’s wallet. They require a clunky additional step of scanning such a code. They require use of a mobile device and QR codes themselves can be hacked and replaced with one that has the hacker’s public address. On top of all of this, there is no confirmation of the funds being transferred successfully, and given the inherent privacy risks associated with address reuse, a new one must be used each time a transaction is made to the same party.

Add to this the reality that blockchain transactions are irreversible with no trusted third party to call to “stop payment” if there is an error and the psychological discomfort of crypto users is understandable. Contrast this to how easy it is to use a centralized service such as PayPal or Venmo. It’s perhaps unfair to compare what are, under the hood, two radically different means of wealth transfer. However, the masses will continue to use whichever method is more user-friendly, less risky to interact with, and more apt to have readily available customer support if something goes wrong.

To scale socially, transferring wealth with Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin or any cryptocurrency needs to be as simple as exchanging funds when using incumbent services. Even stable coins like Tether, whose primary purpose is to improve the adoption of crypto in commerce by eliminating price volatility, will never achieve broad adoption if it isn’t super easy and safe to use.

Tackling poor cryptocurrency UX requires abstraction: that is, wrapping the overly technical processes with aesthetically-pleasing and easy to use functionality in a manner somewhat similar to how the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) eliminates the need for users to have to interact with complex underlying protocols like TCP/IP and creates greatly enhanced user interface experience. A great deal of emphasis is placed on the concept of ‘programmable money’, but a critical layer – that is, the front-end – is being neglected.

Users should never have to know what a complex public address is in the first place. Transaction confirmations should be clear and understandable. Data needs to be able to be included with transactions indicating what they are for, and the method of moving value has to go beyond the risk and limiting “send only” capability that crypto supports today. For example, the ability to send a request for payment (think order cart, invoice, etc.) securely and decentralized or the ability to establish recurring payments for subscriptions.

All of this is impossible today and can’t be solved by an individual decentralized wallet because the problem exists, technically speaking, between them. In the same way that no endpoint on the internet could deliver the capabilities of HTTP by itself, the usability issues need to be resolved by the crypto industry at large through the establishment of a usability standard that spans across all wallets, exchanges and crypto payment processors as well as across all blockchain tokens/coins.

Wallets attempt to tackle these problems by themselves, with varying degrees of success, but it’s time for the various stakeholders, wallets, exchanges and crypto payment processors to coordinate and work together to launch an industry standard protocol that can deliver the leap to dramatically improved usability for blockchain like the Web did for the Internet.

During times of crisis in the industry, investors usually take refuge in bitcoin. Following the recently reported scandal involving crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin tether (USDT), traders have converted their tether into bitcoin. Though both firms have issued a joint statement denying any wrongdoing, investors are playing it safe.

Such events give an opportunity to traditional brokerages to enter the nascent space as they offer a trusted relationship to their clients. The latest to take the plunge is online trading firm E*Trade Financial Group as it reportedly readies to offer cryptocurrency trading in BTC and ether (ETH) on its platform. E*Trade had 4.9 million brokerage accounts on Dec. 31 of last year. With such a massive reach, the move would be an important one for cryptocurrency adoption.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin completed a bullish crossover this week for the first time since October 2015. This move arguably indicates a trend reversal. The bear market has seen a lot of investors lose huge sums of money. One among them was a seasoned investor, Japanese billionaire and founder of multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group, Masayoshi Son who booked a loss of about $130 million trading bitcoin.

While many consider bitcoin to be digital gold, a recent survey in Europe found that only 49% of respondents believe that BTC will be around 10 years from now. This shows that cryptocurrencies will have to evolve further to be accessible and friendly to the non-tech savvy public.

The BTC/USD pair has largely stayed above the breakout level of $4,914.11 for the past three weeks. But the bulls are struggling to push the price to the next overhead resistance of $5,900.

Currently, the 50-week SMA is acting as a resistance. If the bulls defend the $4,914.11 levels again during the next fall, it will indicate buying at lower levels and the pair might remain range bound for a few more weeks. Consolidation at these levels is a positive sign.

But if the price rebounds sharply from the current levels or from $4,914.11, the cryptocurrency could rally to $5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at this level.

On the downside, if the bears sink the pair below $4,914.11, it can drop to the 20-week EMA and below it to $4,255.

The next couple of weeks are very important as it will set the stage for the next leg of the move.

XEM/USD

When all the top 20 coins are in the red, it shows that the markets are at a risk of turning down. Nem (XEM) was the second-best performer this week as it fell by about 9% in the past seven days. What is in store? Can it stage a recovery or will it continue to slide further? Let us find out.

The recovery in the XEM/USD pair hit a roadblock at the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. The price has been correcting for the past three weeks. The bulls will attempt to defend the support at $0.060 and below it $0.053. If these supports breakdown, a retest of the lows is probable.

On the other hand, if the pair rebounds from $0.060, the bulls will again try to propel it above the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. If successful, it can move up to the 50-week SMA at $0.10 and above it to $0.13. The cryptocurrency is yet to form a reversal setup. We shall wait for it to show some strength before turning positive on it.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been in the news for the past few days as a few exchanges delisted it. After the initial plunge, prices seem to be stabilizing. The delisting put it and its creator, Craig Wright, in the limelight. Ayr United, a football team in Scotland, has signed a sponsorship that will feature the bitcoin SV logo on its shirts.

The BSV/USD pair had been trading inside a range of $102.580 and $58.072 for the past few weeks. It turned down from the top of the range three weeks back and since then has been facing strong selling due to the negative news surrounding it.

The bears broke below the support of the range at $58.072 and continued lower. Currently, the bulls are attempting to rebound from the psychological support of $50. If the bulls carry the price back into the range, we can expect the pair to consolidate between $58.072 and $102.580 for the next few weeks.

But if the bulls fail to ascend above $58.072, the bears will again try to breakdown the support at $50. If that happens, a retest of the lows at $38.528 is possible.

ETH/USD

The co-founder of Ethereum has proposed increasing Ether staking rewards once the protocol switches to Proof of Stake (PoS). Meanwhile, Ethereum developers this week announced that they had raised the required funding for a third-party audit of the ProgPoW code.

In other news, reports recently surfaced that Samsung plans to develop a public-private blockchain based on Ethereum. The token is likely to be named Samsung Coin.

Societe Generale SFH — a subsidiary of Societe Generale Group — issued a 100 million euro bond on the Ethereum blockchain.

In a negative development, a hacker managed to siphon off about 45,000 ether by successfully guessing weak private keys.

The ETH/USD pair has slipped back below the breakout level of $167.32, which is a negative sign. It invalidates the bullish breakout of the ascending triangle pattern. The next support on the downside is $144.78. If this also breaks, the drop could extend to the trendline of the ascending triangle.

However, if the pair rebounds off the support at $144.78, the bulls will again try to scale above $167.32. If successful, the next overhead resistance is $187.98. If this level is crossed, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and quickly rally to its target objective of $251.64. As it has formed a reversal pattern at the bottom, this target price might even be crossed.

BNB/USD

Binance’s token sale platform Launchpad successfully completed the sale of Matic Network (MATIC) tokens through its new lottery system. About 58.38% of the applicants benefitted from the lottery. Binance completed the launch of its decentralized trading platform (DEX) just a week after launching its own blockchain, Binance Chain.

Binance also launched its much-awaited exchange in Singapore, where it initially plans to offer bitcoin trading using Singapore dollars. Binance coin (BNB) is still holding out close to its lifetime highs. What is its next likely direction? Let’s take a look.

The BNB/USD pair came within a whisker of breaking out to new highs but failed to do so. The pair is facing selling at the resistance line of the wedge pattern. However, the positive point is that the pullback has been shallow. This shows that the buyers are keen to step in even on a minor dip.

If the pair stays above the uptrend line of the wedge, it might enter into a consolidation for a couple of weeks, after which we expect another attempt by the bulls to make a new high. A new high is likely to attract more buyers and the cryptocurrency might surprise on the upside.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line of the wedge. A breakdown of the wedge is a bearish pattern that can result in a quick drop to the 20-week EMA.

From a mad rush to buy Bitcoin to a new push for gaming tokens on Ethereum, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin trading volume in Thailand has soared 212% on peer-to-peer trading platform LocalBitcoins.

The spike follows days of publicity surrounding a couple on the run who have garnered worldwide attention for attempting to live off the coast of Phuket, Thailand in a seastead home. An early American Bitcoin investor named Chad Elwartowski and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet, also known as “Bitcoin girl Thailand”, are accused of “violating Thai sovereignty.”

The Thai navy has seized the home and reportedly revoked Elwartowski’s visa.

The story thrust crypto into the spotlight and created a Bitcoin buying frenzy in Thailand. For the week ended April 20, BTC trading volume on LocalBitcoins spiked to 68.16 million Thai Baht worth roughly $2.1 million versus a trading volume of 21.8 million Thai Baht worth roughly $685,000 for the previous week.

Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee says an increase of Bitcoin buying outside the US is playing a big role in the sharp rise of BTC’s price in 2019. According to Lee, at least 30% of Bitcoin’s on chain activity, which is near its all-time highs from the last bull run, is from countries with relatively small economies.

“What I think we have to remember is crypto is probably a 70% story outside the US. And I think events like Venezuela and the devaluation of the Turkish lira, these have actually caused on-chain volumes to take off because on a LocalBitcoins basis, people are saying, ‘Look, I don’t trust using these local currencies. I don’t trust the banks. I’m going to start using Bitcoin.’”

Ethereum

The developers of Gods Unchained, a competitive trading card game on the Ethereum blockchain that uses non-fungible tokens (NFT) to bring real ownership to in-game assets, just outlined how they’re scaling NFT usage for players and developers.

Ripple and XRP

Ripple’s senior vice president of product, Asheesh Birla, details how Facebook can use blockchain tech to take the friction out of payments for mobile consumers. Birla says Facebook is poised to build the next ‘super app’ by using a blockchain-based payment service to help customers load funds into the new super app for e-commerce payments and in-app payments.

“But here’s where Facebook, by leveraging blockchain infrastructure and crypto exchanges, may have an added advantage. The company can activate its already massive user base in the region and solve the same last-mile payments problem by partnering with regional crypto exchanges as on and off ramps to the Facebook super app.

Tapping into blockchain and crypto technology in this way could help Facebook scale in emerging markets and take market share away from incumbent providers. Thus, reinventing Facebook as we know it today.”

Topics include Hoskinson’s thoughts on the Bitfinex allegations, Cardano (ADA) and the recent IOHK summit, access to the Haskell course released in Ethiopia, staking support on Windows, and the future of the proof-of-stake protocol.



﻿",2019-04-28,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-jaguar-idUSKCN1S40UD,"(Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest auto manufacturer, said on Monday it is testing software that will allow drivers of its cars to earn the IOTA cryptocurrency as a reward for sharing data.

The company is developing what it calls “smart wallet” technology to be installed in its automobiles. This would reward Jaguar car drivers with IOTA coins for actions such as enabling their vehicles to automatically report useful data, such as traffic congestion or potholes to navigation providers or local authorities.

Drivers could also earn rewards if the car participates in a ride-sharing program, Jaguar said. The tokens earned could be used to pay for tolls, parking and charging for electric cars.

The overall goal was to “achieve zero emissions, zero accidents, and zero congestion,” the company said.

Global car companies are exploring blockchain applications, figuring out different ways in which they can leverage the technology to suit their different needs. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.

The British car company is testing the technology at the new Jaguar Land Rover software engineering base in Shannon, Ireland, where engineers have already equipped several vehicles, including the Jaguar F-PACE and Range Rover Velar, with “smart wallet” features, the company said.

It does not yet have a timetable for when it will be commercially available, said Jaguar, a subsidiary of Tata Motors.

The IOTA token is based on a distributed ledger technology that enables people and machines to transfer money and data without any transaction fees. IOTA trades on digital asset exchanges and was last at 27 U.S. cents per token.

“The smart wallet technology ... can be easily adapted into all new vehicles,” Dominik Schiener, IOTA co-founder and co-chairman of its board, told Reuters on Friday.

“IOTA wants to enable interoperability with all these different players. So there is no Jaguar coin, no BMW coin, but one universal token for this machine economy,” he added.",2019-04-28 23:15:09+00:00,https://www.ccn.com/british-baroness-325-million-bitcoin-development-delays/,"

By CCN.com: Scottish lingerie tycoon and parliamentarian Baroness Michelle Mone’s crypto venture, a £250m ($325 million) condo development in Dubai, is reportedly seeing delays, according to The Times.

Mone was planning to sell two bedroom apartments for £185,000 worth of bitcoin after developing the Aston Plaza Project. But the development remains stalled at 25% complete since last January, according to the developer’s website and promotional materials. The £250m development was advertised to be completed by this summer but nothing’s moving.

Baroness Mone’s EQUI coin

Bitcoin made an earnest and shockingly effective attempt at creating a payment and banking solution. EQUI is a blockchain back-end that’s been shoe-horned into a startup investment clearinghouse platform. Bitcoin is open source, public, and raised computing power to maintain and secure its network. EQUI is propriety, corporate, and raised money.

Baroness Mone should lean in; She’s onto something despite missteps

Obviously a very smart and tenacious woman, Mone advanced from trying to compete with bitcoin in her first venture to trying to acquire bitcoin with her second. That represents a fundamental strategic shift in her view of the crypto industry. It evinces the realization that bitcoin presents far more lucrative and substantive opportunities as a truly competitive merchant currency with an unmatched network effect among cryptos.

But instead of studying and making a useful contribution to the bitcoin industry, Mone again shoe-horned bitcoin into a foreign condo development project. So she’s pursued the strategy twice now of exploiting bitcoin hype to raise money by appearing to be working in the crypto business while not actually doing anything in the crypto business. This is the kind of corporate exploitation that Andreas Antonopoulos warned about in many talks.

Corporations will mislead the public. “Forget about bitcoin – we’re using its underlying technology, blockchain” goes the familiar refrain. But what they’re doing isn’t anything like bitcoin. Doesn’t have bitcoin’s salient characteristics. Doesn’t even attempt to solve the problems that bitcoin solves.

Now with Baroness Mone after bitcoin instead of another blockchain fake coin, we’ve seen another phenomenon Andreas Antonopoulos has described: infrastructure inversion. Amazing this is an example of it happening within a few years within the same entrepreneur’s crypto ventures.

As the crypto market is hoping for a stronger and more sustainable recovery, crypto-to-crypto exchange Gate.io has a plan that might help strengthen their positions and move up in global rankings.

The exchange, which is usually ranked around the 50th position by trading volume, is looking to launch a more decentralized trading platform, strengthen their geographical expansion and is mulling fiat-to-crypto trading, according to Marie Tatibouet, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at Gate.io. Moreover, they are always open to buy new companies, she told Cryptonews.com declining to specify.

Gate.io has recently launched their own initial exchange offering (IEO) platform called Gate.io Startup and announced they will be launching a more decentralized exchange to run alongside their current, centralized one, under the name of GEX, running on a blockchain named Gatechain. The company recently raised USD 64 million in crypto for the blockchain project during the first phase of the distribution of their native token Gatechain Token, which will power the Gatechain blockchain.

The exact level of decentralization of such projects might be a tricky question. For example, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently launched Binance DEX, a non-custodial exchange, that prompted heated debates how decentralized it really is.

“Gate.io will release further details on decentralization once the testnet [of Gatechain] is launched,” Tatibouet said, adding that the testnet launch is expected in Q3 of this year, while the mainnet should go live in Q4.

Among other things, the new trading platform should have features such as the recovery of stolen assets and private keys, while supporting multiple blockchains for trading, and cross chain trading is also in the agenda.

“Gate.io and GEX will be complementary to each other to offer traders the tools and benefits that matter most to them. Gatechain is a mainnet blockchain and the future GEX will support trading of the assets created on Gatechain, and GEX will also support other blockchains (which is not the case so far for Binance DEX),” Tatibouet said.

According to her, customer onboarding will be faster and it will offer greater anonymity than Gate.io.

“Our current platform Gate.io will remain to be a centralized exchange supporting more functionalities including margin trading, future trading, cryptocurrency lending, etc.,” she added.

Another two ways to lure more customers

Also, the exchange aims to keep adding more languages on its platform (now there are 12 languages.)

“That should also increase the number of users from around the world,” the CMO said, adding that some of their biggest markets are Russia and Ukraine.

As for the fiat-to-crypto trading, Tatibouet said that despite they have no immediate plans, they’re looking into it and next steps “will depend on the whole regulation landscape.”

“We offer customer to customer (c2c) in Chinese yen and Korean won. Obviously, with c2c you have to have enough users on the platform to trade with each other. In China and Korea we definitely have enough users. That might be the case as well in other areas,” the CMO said.

Dealing with wash trading

A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace.

Trading volume on Gate.io:

“Our volume is all real, and right now we’re averaging about USD 50 million per day,” the CMO said, adding that they’re certified by Blockchain Transparency Institute, a group of blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, that is known for their reports on wash trading (however, the website of the project does not disclose who the members of this for profit group are.)

“We’re working with BTI and they alert us when they see wash trading happening so we can catch that user and get rid of the issue,” the CMO said. Getting rid of the issue is done exactly how you might expect: by kicking the offending trader off the exchange.",

In a statement, the SEC said the suspension will be effective from 9:30pm EDT on April 29 until 11:59pm EDT on May 10.

The SEC said it had taken the decision “due to concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace” surrounding its outstanding common stock, promotional activities and the impact they had on the market, as well as the company’s current financial condition. It added:

“The commission cautions broker-dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that they should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently available information and any information subsequently issued by the company.”

Brokers and dealers are being urged not to enter quotations relating to Bitcoin Generation’s securities unless they strictly comply with the commission’s rules.

The company is based in Oklahoma, and the SEC has also said it has concerns “regarding the viability and valuation of a bond that Bitcoin Generation purportedly acquired from an entity based in the United Kingdom.”

This statement appears to relate to the acquisition of a €20 million bond in March 2018, which was worth about $24.4 million at the time and sourced from the London Stock Exchange. When the bond was announced, the CEO of Bitcoin Generation, Deniz Hadjiev, described it as a “small step in improving the financial situation of the company as we continue to build our mining operations.”

The U.S. brokerage is also reportedly finalizing a third party to hold the cryptocurrencies, Nathaniel Popper, tech reporter at The New York Times, tweeted Friday.

Founded in 1982, Nasdaq-listed E*Trade has close to 4 million customers. Last year, the firm also launched trading in bitcoin futures from CME Group for customers.

Interest in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets has literally exploded worldwide over the last few years.

The reason they have become so attractive is that they serve a multitude of purposes: from being a cutting-edge payment method to acting as an alternative (and rather unregulated) means of speculating. The skyrocketing value reached from the second half of 2017 to 2018 by the main cryptocurrencies (when Bitcoin was worth approximately 20,000 USD) was indeed a key factor, supported, among others, by the ground-breaking decision of the Chicago stock exchange to allow trading of futures on cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009) was originally conceived as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party” (S. Nakamoto – White Paper). After almost ten years, crypto-assets, still independent from governments and central banks, can make it possible to handle substantial sums in a rapid, anonymous and almost free manner.

As of today, several types of crypto-assets exist: (i) payment/exchange/currency tokens (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), (ii) investment tokens (generally used in initial coin offerings) and (iii) utility tokens (which enable access to specific products or services). Inevitably, the widespread distribution of such assets boosted an area of business, constantly developing, of various service providers directly involved in the trading of crypto-assets and in the distribution of goods and services paid with crypto-assets.

Nonetheless, the crypto-asset phenomenon and its revolutionary technology (so-called blockchain, which is a type of distributed ledger technology) are perceived as a potential threat to monetary sovereignty: accordingly, in the European Union, the attention of central institutions towards crypto-assets has grown substantially. In effect, the latest reports from the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets authorities highlight the potential risks about consumer protection, operational resilience and market integrity along with concerns about tax evasion, fraud and money laundering.

These comments notwithstanding, several jurisdictions have started to deal with crypto-assets in a reasonable manner, qualifying them as private money or foreign currency, although the same are not recognised in any EU member State or by the European Central Bank as fiat money (i.e. value designated as legal tender, typically in the form of notes or coins).

Although 2018 and 2019 registered a substantial loss of value of the major cryptocurrencies (confirming their high volatility), there are rumours that giants of finance and of big data companies are ready to implement blockchain-based internal payment systems for their clients (such as JP Morgan, Facebook and Telegram – Il Sole 24 Ore, 4 April 2019). This keeps crypto-assets fixed in the attention of investors and experts.

EU and non-EU State’s authorities and regulators are not overlooking the risks and the opportunities of this global phenomenon. As concerns the Italian experience, absent comprehensive legislation, there are already guidelines on taxation of crypto-assets and specific provisions on anti-money laundering.

Italian taxation of cryptocurrencies: new risks and opportunities

Private investors were able to derive impressive gains from the trading of crypto-assets across 2017 and 2018 (and for the same reason, dreadful losses across 2018 and 2019). All of this thanks to an environment counting more than 200 trading platforms operating globally (ESMA report 2019) allowing users to quickly upload cryptocurrencies from their physical wallets (e.g. hardware or paper wallet) or mobile / online wallets and carry out thousands of transactions a year (with minimum service fees). Transactions range from simple cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-to-fiat cryptocurrency exchanges (pairs) to derivative-like transaction (margin trading) and token trades.

All of this is already known and partly understood by the Italian tax authorities, which from 2016 was asked by several taxpayers (mostly individuals) to issue rulings on the most appropriate tax treatment of incomes deriving from cryptocurrencies. On such occasions, the tax authorities reached the conclusion that cryptocurrencies are to be deemed as akin to foreign currency (going further than the findings of the first decision of the European Court of Justice on this subject – case no. C-264/14 “Hedqvist” based on which “it is common ground that the ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency has no other purpose than to be a means of payment and that it is accepted for that purpose by certain operators“). Accordingly, in the tax authorities’ view:

proceeds arising from “speculative” exchanges between cryptocurrencies or from cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies or should be subject to the standard rules applicable to income arising from trades of foreign fiat currencies (i.e. subject to a flat 26% substitutive tax for Italian resident individuals / non-commercial entities and to the standard corporate income tax for Italian resident / established entities); similar rules apply to proceeds arising from trades of utility tokens;

the “market value” of cryptocurrencies is to be annually reported as if the same assets are held abroad by Italian resident individuals / non-commercial entities (the omission is potentially subject to a penalty ranging from 3% to 15%);

certain cryptocurrency exchange services should be exempt from Italian VAT (as for standard services relating to foreign currencies).

Tax experts criticize the approach of the Italian authorities’ as its results are highly inconsistent with the key features and the inner nature of cryptocurrencies. In effect, Italian standard tax rules applicable to fiat currency are not fit for cryptocurrencies, which are extremely volatile, far from being generally accepted as means of payment and often hard to convert to fiat currency (due to the money laundering concerns shared by the vast majority of the financial institutions). Eventually this could result in a burdensome taxation on an accrual basis rather than on a cash basis (as it is instead for fiat currencies).

Moreover, annual reporting duties generally applicable to (financial) assets held abroad are in contrast with the nature of crypto-assets, which are everywhere and nowhere.

Crypto-assets and Italy’s new residents regime

Notwithstanding such issues, looking at the Italian tax authorities’ approach from a different angle, some potential planning opportunities may arise. In fact, if crypto-assets are akin to foreign investments / assets held abroad for the Italian tax authorities, then gains arising from the latter should be deemed as sourced abroad in certain cases. If this holds true, new residents relocated to Italy under the so called “new residents tax regime” could benefit from a full exemption from Italian income tax on such gains and related reporting duties.

In effect, since 2017 Italy has applied a new territorial system of taxation aimed at attracting high net worth individuals, including successful individuals in the sports, arts, and fashion and design sectors, who could be interested in moving to Italy to take part in these thriving sectors. In a nutshell, under this regime, Italian-source income and gains are taxable in the usual way while (i) foreign income and gains are sheltered from Italian tax and (ii) foreign assets are neither subject to the standard reporting duties not to Italian inheritance and gift tax (as well as to property taxes). Moreover, no remittance taxation mechanisms apply. The main conditions to benefit from this regime are that the new resident (i) has not been Italian tax resident for the last 9 out of 10 years (before the relocation to Italy) and (ii) pays an annual charge of €100,000 (which can be increased by €25,000 per each family member relocating with him to Italy under the regime).

It is worthwhile mentioning that the “new residents tax regime” does not provide shelter from the international automatic exchange of information (i.e. the so called Common Reporting Standard (CRS) as well as FATCA with the US). Although crypto-assets are still a rather uncharted territory in terms of CRS and FATCA, as anticipated States and financial institutions have started to take adequate measures to increase the level of monitoring of this phenomenon for tackling the misuse of crypto-assets in illegal transactions.

AML regulations: the first stronghold against misuse of crypto-assets

Recent developments on anti-money laundering (AML) procedures of banks and financial institution are indeed the first answer to the need of tracking cryptocurrency transactions movements on a global scale. At the EU level, the fifth AML Directive (EU 2018/843) extends the AML reporting duties to cryptocurrency exchangers and service providers. Italy promptly implemented such EU rules and accordingly cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers are subject to the standard customer due diligence and related reporting duties on suspicious transactions. Moreover, the Italian Ministry of Finance is considering establishing a special registry to collect information from the market for cryptocurrencies in Italy.

Consequently, it is clear that holders of crypto-assets should pay particular attention to the importance of keeping adequate evidence not only of their initial investments but also (and more importantly) of their trading activities over the years. This should prevent technical complications and costly delays (considering how volatile cryptocurrencies are) for quickly liquidating investments (in fiat currencies) and maximising gains through banks and financial institutions.

Takeaways

The legal treatment of cryptocurrencies is still a developing area and, as such, is still subject to different approaches. In fact, while EU institutions are trying to regulate cryptocurrencies in a specific way, national authorities tend to apply existing principles regarding currencies or financial products.

Since Italy still lacks an organic legal framework for crypto-currencies, the Italian tax authorities currently apply the existing income tax and reporting rules generally applicable to foreign currencies (seeking for a compromise between the different functions of cryptocurrencies). Although, this approach has been met by general criticism, it could have inadvertently opened the door to planning opportunities under the “new residents tax regime”.

Finally, AML regulations and the related due diligence procedures could represent another open challenge. In fact, given the specific nature of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, evidence of the legal source of the funds initially invested could be difficult to collect, especially if the taxpayer has been in the crypto-market since before the introduction of these regulations.

The development was announced by major Canadian electricity provider Hydro-Quebec on April 29.

Under the new regulations, the Régie de l’énergie has ordered power producer Hydro-Quebec to allocate 300 megawatts (MW) to the blockchain industry. “This 300 MW will be in addition to the 158 MW already granted to existing customers approved by Hydro-Quebec, and to the 210 MW granted to existing customers approved by municipal distributors,” the announcement further explains.

In order to receive some of the specially allocated power, companies must pass a selection process where they are graded on four criteria including the number of jobs created in Quebec, total payroll of direct jobs, the value of investments and heat recovery. Hydro-Quebec says in the release that the new rules will enable the organization to protect the low rates it offers to customers.

Canada has been recognized as a leading cryptocurrency nation based on its innovation, low energy costs, high internet speed and favorable regulatory regime. In late July of last year, Hydro-Quebec revealed that the province had an energy surplus equivalent to 100 terawatt hours over 10 years and offers some of the lowest electricity rates in North America.

Last June, Hydro-Quebec proposed new rules, under which blockchain-related companies will be required to bid for electricity and quantify the jobs and investment they expect to generate per megawatt.

The news was revealed in an announcement published by FIN-FSA on April 27.

With Finland’s Act on Virtual Currency Service Providers set to come into effect on May 1, the watchdog clarifies that it will henceforth be statutorily required to register all crypto exchanges, custodian crypto wallet providers and cryptocurrency issuers operating in the country.

As FIN-FSA notes, the new Finnish legislation has been drafted on the basis of the European Union (EU)’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive. As reported, the latter came into force in July 2018 and established a revised legal framework for EU financial watchdogs to regulate cryptocurrencies and mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing.

FIN-FSA outlines that registration will necessitate statutory compliance with multiple rules, including those pertaining to the storage and protection of client funds, segregation of service provider and client assets, rules for the marketing of services and heeding AML/CFT laws.

The watchdog also announced a briefing directed to the crypto industry on May 15 to be held at the Bank of Finland's auditorium in Helsinki. The briefing will reportedly lay out FIN-FSA’s registration timeline and the steps and schedule for the procedure, as well as addressing formal and draft regulations and guidelines applicable to industry participants.

Notwithstanding the new legislation, FIN-FSA states that investor protection is not fully resolved within the new measures, and reminds the public that:

“The risks related to virtual currency investments remain unchanged. The risks include sudden major fluctuations in value, data security threats pertaining to exchange services and custodian wallet providers, and the nature of several virtual currencies as speculative investments not involving any inherent source of return.”

As reported this March, Helsinki-based international peer-to-peer crypto exchange LocalBitcoins has recently announced its forthcoming supervision by FIN-FSA in accordance with the country’s new legislation.

In the EU context, member state France is reportedly poised to attempt to persuade other countries in the bloc to adopt cryptocurrency regulations similar to its own new framework, approved earlier this month.",,https://www.coindesk.com/novogratzs-galaxy-digital-crypto-fund-lost-272-7-million-in-2018,"Galaxy Digital Holdings, the crypto merchant bank founded by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, lost $97 million in the fourth quarter, according to financials disclosed Monday.

The net loss widened from $76.7 million in the third quarter and from about $100,000 a year earlier, according to the filing with Canadian securities regulators. (Last February, New York-based Galaxy bought a Canadian publicly traded company in a reverse takeover.)

For all of 2018, its first full year of operation, the company lost $272.7 million.

The majority of the red ink in 2018, $101.4 million, came from selling digital assets at a loss.

Galaxy also recorded $75.5 million in paper losses on crypto it held that declined in price, $8.5 million in unrealized losses on investments in companies and $88.4 million in operating expenses.

Which coins lost

At the end of 2018, Galaxy held 9,724 bitcoin ($36.4 million), 92,545 ether ($12.3 million), 2.4 million EOS ($6 million) and 60,227 of monero ($2.8 million). The firm increased its investment in bitcoin and ether from the beginning of the year when it held 5,902 BTC and 57,000 ETH.

Galaxy also used to hold large amounts of Wax ($50.2 million) and BlockV tokens ($17.4 million), which disappeared from the top ranks of the firm’s investments at the end of the year.

According to the report, Galaxy lost money selling bitcoin ($70.3 million) and ether ($64.4 million), which was partially offset by $54.3 million earned selling some cryptocurrencies short (it’s not specified which ones).

Bitcoin was the biggest source of losses at the beginning of 2018, while ether caused the most damage during the rest of the year.

Interestingly, Galaxy lost as much as $47 million on the depreciation of the Wax token, an asset created to power a platform for trading virtual goods like items in video games.

Several other altcoins also lost in price before Galaxy could profitably sell them during 2018: Kin ($10.9 million in losses), BlockV ($17.2 million) and Aion ($8.6 million). Some $5 million was also lost on EOS.

Protocols, mining and ICOs

A number of companies and investment funds in Galaxy’s portfolio declined in value.

For example, the Pantera ICO Fund LP shares’ depreciation caused the loss of $14.1 million (Galaxy currently has $17.4 million invested in the fund). The firm also took a haircut of $11.3 million on its shares of Canada-based Hut 8 Mining Corp, and $11.1 million on crypto wallet firm Xapo.

As of the end of 2018, Galaxy held $41.9 million in the stock of Block.One’s, the creator of EOS, plus some $5 million more in Galaxy EOS VC Fund focused on developing the EOS.IO ecosystem.

Meanwhile, payments startup Ripple Labs received $23.8 million, including “an indirect investment through a special purpose vehicle,” the report says.

Galaxy also invested $26 million in mining businesses, including Hut 8 Mining and Bitfury; $7.5 million in custodian and multi-signature wallet provider BitGo; and $5 million in Bakkt, the bitcoin futures exchange yet-to-be-launched by New York Stock Exchange parent ICE.

Other investments include Silvergate Capital Corporation, parent of the crypto friendly Silvergate Bank; tokenization startups AlphaPoint and Templum; investment vehicles Cryptology Asset and Pantera Venture Fund; and Mercantile Global Holdings, a Puerto Rico-based entity operating the recently founded San Juan Mercantile Exchange. The firm also provided $3.8 millions of loans for the crypto lending platform BlockFi.

Risk factors

Talking about the risks Galaxy may face in the future, the report pays special attention to the concentration of power in the hands of the CEO and major stakeholder Mike Novogratz, who owns more than 71 percent of Galaxy.

Among the regulatory and market risks, Galaxy is “highly dependent on Michael Novogratz, exposing shareholders to material and unpredictable ‘key man’ risk,” the document says, adding that the CEO’s “interests may be different from those of shareholders,” and there is a danger he “could engage in activities outside of GDH LP or could quit GDH LP in favor of other pursuits.”

No less notable, the report adds: “Mr. Novogratz’s public profile makes it more likely that GDH LP will attract material regulatory scrutiny, which would be costly and distracting regardless of whether GDH LP has engaged in any unlawful conduct.”

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Losses from the theft of cryptocurrencies from exchanges and fraud-related activities surged in the first quarter of the year to $1.2 billion, or 70 percent of the level for all of 2018, cybersecurity firm CipherTrace said on Tuesday.

The value of losses from crime in the digital currency sector in 2018 hit $1.7 billion. But cryptocurrency crime has ballooned as the market has slowed down, prices have plunged and business activity has stalled.

In the first quarter of 2019, theft of digital currencies from exchanges and scams totaled $356 million, while losses from fraud or misappropriated funds amounted to $851 million, the respected U.S.-based CipherTrace said in a quarterly report.

CipherTrace said it included losses at Canadian digital platform QuadrigaX, where roughly C$180 million (US$134 million) in cryptocurrencies have been frozen in user accounts after the founder, the only person with the password to gain access, died suddenly in December.

“Crypto crime has gotten worse because regulations are still weakly enforced. Europe broadly has not implemented its regulations yet and the cyber criminal community continues to grow,” CipherTrace chief executive officer Dave Jevans told Reuters.

“I would also add that insider issues such as fraud or theft have grown mostly due to operations outside of the U.S. where regulations are poor, or simply due to greed and mismanagement by young management teams at these cryptocurrency companies that are managing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.”

Jevans is also the chairman of the Anti-Phishing Working Group, a global organization that aims to help solve cyber crimes.

The CipherTrace report also said there was a major gap in the current cryptocurrency regulatory environment with respect to cross-border payments from U.S. exchanges to offshore exchanges, which are beyond the purview of U.S. authorities.

An analysis of 164 million bitcoin transactions showed that cross-border payments to offshore exchanges have grown 46% over the last two years, contributing to the $8.7 trillion, or 11.5 percent of the world’s wealth, hidden offshore, the report said.",2019-04-30 21:20:09+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-and-refundo-now-provide-tax-return-payouts-in-btc/,"Bitpay and Refundo Now Provide Tax Return Payouts in BTC

On April 30, the global cryptocurrency payment processing firm Bitpay announced its partnership with the tax-related financial products and services provider Refundo. The collaboration will give U.S. residents the ability to receive all or a portion of their federal and state tax refunds in crypto.

Federal and State Tax Refunds Using Blockchain Payments

U.S. taxpayers now have the ability to get all or a portion of their federal and state tax refunds back in bitcoin core (BTC), according to the latest announcement from the Atlanta-based company Bitpay. The firm recently partnered with Refundo, a leading tax service provider founded in 2011. Refundo provides taxpayers with professional financial services alongside refunds, advances, and refund transfers.

The company says the partnership with Bitpay allows for a transparent and seamless experience during tax season. Refundo believes the underbanked could benefit from a refund experience tied to crypto because it could help bridge the gap for individuals with alternative banking needs.

“Refundo offers several options to help taxpayers receive their tax refunds safer, faster and more conveniently,” Roger Chinchilla, CEO at Refundo, said during the announcement. The tax service provider added:

Adding bitcoin was a natural fit for our customers who often do not have traditional checking accounts, pay high check cashing fees and regularly send money internationally. Coin-RT enables them to get bitcoin quickly and easily for one flat fee.

‘Demand for More Digital Choice’

The new Coin-RT product offers taxpayers an account and they are given a unique routing and account number to input on their tax return. Refundo users who want a refund in BTC must provide identification for KYC purposes and a valid BTC address. When the federal and state deposit comes in, Bitpay sends the crypto to the taxpayer’s wallet. Rolf Haag, head of business solutions at Bitpay, remarked that the Atlanta company is thrilled to help power Refundo’s new solution.

“Refundo can now offer their customers a bitcoin payout for their tax refunds, meeting their customers’ demand for a more digital choice,” Haag pointed out. The Bitpay executive also emphasized that the Refundo and Bitpay collaboration bolsters Bitpay payouts and payroll used in the global marketplace.

The partnership with Refundo follows Bitpay’s recent partnership with the leading global technology solutions company Avnet (Nasdaq: AVT). Avnet has also decided to accept crypto through Bitpay’s services for various products and services. Bitpay believes Avnet clientele and customers getting refunds from Refundo will benefit from the high-speed settlement and low-cost payouts delivered by blockchain payments. Speaking with a representative from Bitpay, news.Bitcoin.com asked the company whether the Refundo payouts will support bitcoin cash (BCH), to which Bitpay responded that at this current time they will only be in BTC.

In a statement, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York alleged that Reginald Fowler of Arizona and Ravid Yosef, said to live in Tel Aviv, Israel, were part of a scheme that involved using bank accounts to move money into a series of unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges.

Court documents released by the Justice Department purport that the alleged money services business operated between February and October 2018. During that period, prosecutors say, the two “opened and used numerous bank accounts at financial institutions that were insured by the [FDIC],” including one based in Manhattan.

Two of the bank accounts named in the court document are allegedly held under the name Global Trading Solutions LLC, one apiece from HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Securities USA/Pershing LLC.

That firm was previously identified in October as having done business with crypto exchange Bitfinex, which is being investigated along with stablecoin issuer Tether by the New York Attorney General’s Office in a development that last week spilled into public view. Past reporting suggests that the corporate entity said to be involved is tied to Crypto Capital, a payment processing firm that has provided services to crypto exchange Bitfinex and others.

“Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef allegedly ran a shadow bank that processed hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated transactions on behalf of numerous cryptocurrency exchanges,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. “Their organization allegedly skirted the anti-money laundering safeguards required of licensed institutions that ensure the U.S. financial system is not used for criminal purposes, and did so through lies and deceit.”

Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and and a count of operating an unlicensed money transmission business (along with a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission business), whereas Yosef, who has not been arrested at the time of announcement, was charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to do so.

According to the press statement, agents from the FBI’s New York Money Laundering Investigations Squad and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) participated in the investigation.

Crypto Capital connection

While the court documents themselves don’t directly state it, supplementary reporting suggests that Global Trading Solutions LLC is tied to licensed financial institution Global Trade Solutions AG. Global Trade Solutions is the parent company of Crypto Capital, a payment processor named in in the NY AG’s investigation of Bitfinex and Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin. The firm is cited as parent company on Crypto Capital’s website.

In addition to doing business with Bitfinex, Crypto Capital’s website names among its customers the now-defunct QuadrigaCX and Coinapult, among others. According to the Wayback Machine, past customers include exchanges Kraken, BTCC and Bitt.

In a letter published by journalist Amy Castor, dated December of last year, Global Trade Solutions’s Ivan Molina wrote that “Global Trade Solutions AG and related entities are being denied banking services in the United States, Europe and other select international locations, as a result of certain AML and financial crimes investigations by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and cooperative international law enforcements and/or regulatory agencies.”

“Authorities investigating GTS and related entities have effectively frozen bank accounts and disabled traditional banking services as it relates to crypto currency and exchange services; in many instances ex parte without a warrant or court order,” Molina stated, a possible reference to the timing in Tuesday’s indictment which indicated that the funds in the HSBC accounts were seized in October.

He then outlines account seizures at HSBC in London, as well as similar actions occurring in the United States, moves that “have resulted in bank accounts being frozen and blocked without warning or explanation, banking services terminated, and access to bank accounts denied.”

Molina included two links in his letter, one of which was to a story by crypto publication The Block that reported the use of Global Trading Solutions LLC’s services for depositing funds to Bitfinex.

As reported last week, Bitfinex and Tether are accused of papering over an alleged $850 million loss using funds originally intended to provide backing for Tether’s USDT stablecoin, a move that the AG’s office alleged wasn’t disclosed to the exchange’s customers. Yet per the court filings, lawyers for Bitfinex and Tether told the AG’s office that the funds aren’t actually lost, but had been seized from Crypto Capital and are being held by authorities in the US, Poland and Portgual.

To date, neither Bitfinex or Tether have been charged with any crimes, and the two sides are set to meet in court in New York on Friday.

This story is actively developing and will be periodically updated with more information.

Blockchain Capital partner Bogart today posted the results of a new survey conducted by Harris Poll in order to provide analytics data on bitcoin’s demographic trends.

Conducted between April 23, 2019 and April 25, 2019, the survey included answers of 2,052 American adults and represents an expanded version of the previous demographic survey released by the firm in October 2017.

According to the survey results, the American population gained more knowledge about bitcoin in terms of six key aspects: awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, propensity to purchase and ownership. With that, the indicators have dramatically increased in many cases since October 2017 despite the bear market of 2018 and the bull market of 2017, the survey writes.

The results outline that bitcoin is a “demographic mega-trend” led by the younger generation in the 18-34 year age range. According to the survey, awareness has become the only aspect where older demographics matched that of younger age groups. As such, the vast majority of American citizens have heard of bitcoin, regardless of age. The proportion of people who heard of bitcoin increased from 77% in October 2017 to 89% in April 2019.

In terms of the ownership aspect, 20% of American citizens aged 18–34 claimed to invest in bitcoin, while those aged 35–44 accounted for 11%. The 45 –54 and 55 –64 age ranges indicated an equal ownership amounting to 5%, with 2% of American retirees over 65 years claimed to hold the biggest cryptocurrency.

Australia's tax man is cracking down on cryptocurrency investors. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: It will now be harder for Australians to under-declare or over-declare the taxes they owe on their crypto holdings or transactions.

This follows an announcement by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) that it will collect bulk records from cryptocurrency businesses in the country. In a statement, the tax collection agency indicated that this will be done to enhance accuracy in tax compliance:

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is collecting bulk records from Australian cryptocurrency designated service providers (DSPs) as part of a data matching program to ensure people trading in cryptocurrency are paying the right amount of tax.

Some of the information that the ATO will obtain from Australia’s crypto-related businesses will include purchase and sale records.

By law, cryptocurrency businesses in Australia are required to keep certain critical records. These include digital wallet records and keys, exchange records, and receipts of transfer or purchase of crypto assets.

Prior to any compliance action being taken, the relevant tax payers will be contacted by the tax collection agency after the data matching exercise to verify the information obtained.

Australia’s law on crypto taxes

Per Australia’s tax laws, capital gains made after disposing of cryptocurrency holdings are taxed. However, if the capital gains or losses are made in a situation where the cryptocurrency is considered to be ‘a personal use asset, there is no tax payable.

Where cryptocurrencies are disposed as a normal business operation, the profits generated are treated as ordinary income, not capital gains. Additionally, in such a business the cost of purchasing cryptocurrency that is used as trading stock is deductible. The cryptocurrency businesses that fall in this category include exchanges, miners and trading firms.

This is not the first time that the ATO is taking steps to ensure tax compliance in Australia’s crypto sector. Last year in January, the ATO announced that it was setting up a task force charged with monitoring cryptocurrency transactions. Just like in the current scenario, then the tax collection agency collaborated with other regulators in tracking money flows related to cryptocurrency investments.

https://twitter.com/PDFStreaming/status/950913948248928257

Currently, the tax collection agency is working with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). It is also partnering with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).

Rate of cryptocurrency adoption in Australia growing

This comes at a time when the number of cryptocurrency hodlers in Australia has risen. A survey by HiveEx cryptocurrency exchange in 2018 revealed that the percentage of Australians owning cryptocurrency had grown to 13.5 percent. About 50 percent of those holding cryptocurrency then had purchased it as an investment.

On the other hand, 34 percent of the hodlers had purchased cryptocurrency out of FOMO – fear of missing out.

The tax collection agency estimates that there are between 0.5 million to 1 million Australians who have invested in cryptocurrencies. Per Coinhills, the Australian dollar is currently ranked the 14th most traded national currency in the cryptocurrency markets. It has a 0.07 percent market share.",2019-04-30 05:37:42+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/nasdaq-adding-index-for-xrp-cryptocurrency-to-global-data-service,"Stock exchange operator Nasdaq is adding yet another cryptocurrency index – this time for the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP.

The company announced Monday that, through its partnership with New Zealand-based blockchain data and research firm Brave New Coin, it will offer “real-time” index information for XRP starting May 1.

Specifically, the XRP Liquid Index (XRPLX) will offer a spot or reference rate for the price of XRP, quoted in U.S. dollars and “based on the most liquid ends of their markets.”

“The XRPLX sources data from only the most liquid exchanges by volume and order-book depth,” Brave New Coin said in a separate statement, adding:

“Current constituent exchanges for the XRPLX include Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Poloniex and Kraken with Coinbase to be added in the next review.”

The new stream will be available on the Nasdaq Global Index Data ServiceSM (GIDS), its consolidated data feed. The index includes data going back to 2014 and is refreshed every five minutes, Nasdaq said.

The index is calculated using a methodology that has been “independently audited” against the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles, the firm added.

Nasdaq first partnered with Brave New Coin earlier this year, when it added indices for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to its global data service.

Last month, Nasdaq also started offering two benchmark indices covering the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization – one with bitcoin and the other without – using data provided by CoinMarketCap.

Crypto Capital has also been tied to Quadriga, a Canadian exchange which lost $140 million a few months ago.

To continue processing customer withdrawals after its funds vanished last fall, Bitfinex allegedly dipped into cash reserves that are meant to back Tether, a move made possible because Bitfinex and Tether share a management team. According to court filings, Bitfinex quietly moved $700 million from Tether’s reserves to the exchange’s own bank accounts. The New York attorney general has ordered iFinex to cease further transfers. iFinex did not reply to a request for a comment.",

Whether cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the stablecoin controversy is worrisome or mere FUD, the news surrounding the $850 million of Bitfinex funds locked up has shaken the markets. Now, digital asset traders are closely monitoring the large premium on Bitfinex, where the price of BTC is trading for $300 more than on most spot markets. The publicly known Bitfinex cold storage wallet is also being monitored as large sums of BTC have left the address since the announcement last week.

Bitfinex Cold Storage Drops Below 90K BTC Following Controversial News

On April 25, the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office issued a press release concerning court documents that accuse the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex of losing $850 million and using the stablecoin operation Tether to cover it up. Bitfinex claims the NYAG court filings are “riddled with false assertions” and the chief financial officer, Giancarlo Devasini, recently told a Bitfinex shareholder the trading platform “needs a few weeks and the funds will be unfrozen.” Since then, however, the U.S. Attorney General’s Office charged two individuals for allegedly providing shadow banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitfinex. Additionally, it’s been revealed that the tether stablecoin (USDT) is only backed by 74% of collateralized USD reserves. All of this news initially shook cryptocurrency markets, but most digital assets have since recovered much of what they lost.

While the community debated the subject heavily on crypto Twitter, millions of dollars worth of BTC left the exchange’s publicly known cold storage address. Armchair sleuths first noticed $89 million worth of BTC moved from the Bitfinex cold wallet to the platform’s hot wallet. Then another $67 million in BTC was moved from the cold storage address. On April 24, the cold wallet had around 120,000 BTC but the address dipped under 90K by the 29th, and today the address holds just 89,404 BTC. Anyone following the tweets from Whale Alert over the last few days will have noticed large amounts of BTC departing from Bitfinex to unknown wallets. Additionally, large amounts of ethereum and other coins have been exiting Bitfinex to unknown wallets.

The ‘Risk Premium’ Returns Once Again

In addition to the large amounts of coins leaving Bitfinex, the exchange has had a significant premium on the trading platform. Today, the price of BTC is $300 higher on Bitfinex than most spot exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Bitstamp. The premium is also higher than other exchanges like Binance, a popular trading platform that also uses a vast amount of USDT. Charlie Humberstone from the data and analytics website Crypto Compare explained on April 30 how the Bitfinex premium hit a high of $346 more than most exchanges or 6.7% higher than the global spot rate. During our last markets update, news.Bitcoin.com also reported on USDT dropping below its $1 peg after the announcement, but it popped above the $1 region on April 27. Humberstone’s recent analysis also notes that this isn’t the first time Bitfinex has seen high premiums, as the price was 8% higher than most global spot exchanges back in March 2017. At the time, Bitfinex had banking problems with the financial institution Wells Fargo.

“What’s unusual, however, is that these dramatic events last year — despite a growing list of rival stablecoins — seemed not to put much of a dent in Tether’s usage,” Humberstone remarked.

Overall cryptocurrency markets endured a loss of around $10 billion last Thursday but digital asset prices have regained around half of those losses so far. There’s still uncertainty lingering in the air concerning the Bitfinex and Tether issue, while crypto enthusiasts wonder if there will be more negative news to come in the near future.

The company named in the recent indictment, Global Trading Solutions LLC, and the two individuals accused of shadow banking indicates that this story isn’t over yet. Additionally, according to Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao on the social media platform Weibo, the exchange may issue a native token.

Desipite all the negativity and market hesitancy in the air, Fundstrat Global Advisors founder Tom Lee believes things could have been worse. “If this tether USDT story broke in mid- to late-2018, the crypto market would probably have seen panic liquidations across the board,” Lee insisted.

Original crypto lending sites charged borrowers a fairly high rate, albeit much lower than credit card companies. However, now that other players like BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Monarch are appearing on the market, it’s becoming an increasingly attractive option. But, is it worth the risk?

Crypto lending can make your money work for you

If you’re one of the fortunate people who invested in the early days, the chances are, you have a nice stash of cryptocurrencies sitting in a hardware wallet. If you’re a die-hard believer in Bitcoin, Ether, or your preferred cryptocurrency, you’re probably HODLing tight to your crypto.

It’s important to keep your cryptocurrency safe and away from hackers. However, you’re not earning any money on your crypto assets if they are simply sitting in a hardware wallet. This is especially true in a bear market when the prices go down.

Moreover, you may need to unlock some of the value of your crypto now to buy a car or pay for reparations on your house, for example. But if you firmly believe that BTC is going to have another bull run, you don’t want to sell any of your stash.

Crypto lending allows you to put your cryptocurrency up as collateral for a fiat loan. You can also do this with a much lower interest than you’d get from a bank. Celsius Network, for example, charges 9% interest on loans backed by crypto. Consider that compared to the 20-25% your credit card company charges.

Moreover, crypto lending sites don’t care about people with a bad credit history or insufficient purchasing history, as long as the crypto collateral is there.

Consider Brock Pierce for a moment. The child-actor-turned-entrepreneur-turned Bitcoin maximalist recently used his BTC as collateral to buy a $1.2 million home in Amsterdam.

Why not just buy it outright? He clearly believes that his crypto assets will be worth a lot more in the long run. Using a crypto lending site, in his case, Swiss provider Nexo, allows him to get the best of both worlds. He gets the fiat for his house and keeps the value of his BTC.

Crypto lending could be risky for several reasons

Crypto lending is not something you should go into blindly. There are always risks involved, especially when it comes to default risk or security risks. Regarding default risk, you should keep in mind that people who are attracted to these sorts of loans may have a bad credit history and are usually deemed a high risk of default.

However, the borrower will put up BTC, ETH, or another cryptocurrency as collateral, as Brock Pierce did. The lending platform usually states that the lender can keep around 80% of the crypto collateral in case of default. But be sure to read the fine print.

Crypto lending is essentially for people who are bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies and understand that they may end up with crypto returns rather than fiat in the case of a default. Lenders understand that the markets are volatile and it may take some time to recover the fiat amount lent out.

If you’re a borrower looking to put your crypto up for a loan, you need to consider the security risks.

You will have to remove your crypto assets from their secured place in your hardware wallet. This means that you must be completely confident in the lending platform’s custodian.

In BlockFi’s case, Gemini is the custodian and for Celsius Network, they use BitGo. These are both extremely well respected in the industry. However, it’s still worth finding out if there is an insurance policy in the event of getting hacked – and up to how much you will be compensated.

Why crypto lending could be worth the risk

Whether you want to convert your crypto to fiat and lend it out or get a cash loan off the back of your crypto, there are plenty of benefits. While lending platforms may give loans to people with bad credit history, they have to put their crypto up for collateral.

Moreover, while credit history may not apply, most companies carry out AML and KYC verification checks on their customers. This at least carries with it some assurance of not dealing with criminals waiting to run off with the cash.

With loan percentages running from 9 to 22% depending on the platform, the good news for the borrower is that they retain the full value of their crypto collateral including its gains and losses.

As for the lender, even in the worst case scenario where the borrower disappears or defaults, they at least have cryptocurrency as compensation – along with the hope that it will be worth even more in the future.",2019-05-01 08:00:14+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/us-income-tax-payers-can-now-get-refunds-in-bitcoin,"Income tax payers in the U.S. now have the option to receive their federal and state refunds in bitcoin.

Blockchain payments processor Bitpay announced the news on Tuesday, saying that the firm has partnered with U.S.-based taxation services provider Refundo for the service.

Refundo customers can choose to receive all or a portion of a tax refund in bitcoin using its CoinRT product. Taxpayers will have to set up an account to get a unique routing and account number to input on their tax return, according to the announcement.

They will also have to provide necessary background information for know-your-customer (KYC) rules, as well as a bitcoin wallet address. Once the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or state has deposited the refund, BitPay will process the payment and send bitcoin to taxpayers’ wallets.

The service is touted as primarily focusing on serving the underbanked community with faster payments and lower transaction fees.

Refundo CEO Roger Chinchilla commented:

“Adding bitcoin was a natural fit for our customers who often do not have traditional checking accounts, pay high check cashing fees and regularly send money internationally. CoinRT enables them to get bitcoin quickly and easily for one flat fee.”

The CoinRT service costs $34.95, regardless of the refund amount. No separate fee is paid by the user to BitPay, the firms told CoinDesk.

Founded in 2011, Bitpay processed over $1 billion worth of transactions last year. The firm has previously partnered with a Florida county tax collector and Ohio state to help them accept taxes in cryptocurrency.

Most recently, Bitpay also partnered with a municipality in Canada to accept bitcoin for property tax payments in a one-year trial.

The total figure includes over $356 million lost from exchanges (including QuadrigaCX’s $195 million) and over $850 million alleged to have been lost from the Bitfinex exchange by the New York Attorney General’s office last week.

It’s worth noting, however, that Bitfinex has claimed the funds have been frozen by various authorities at a payments company and that it is working to retrieve them.

CipherTrace said Tuesday in its “Q1 2019 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report” that the estimated first quarter loss is almost 71 percent of the $1.7 billion loss seen over the whole of 2018.

“These thefts only represent the losses that are visible,” the startup said, adding that the real number of cryptocurrency losses was likely much higher.

Lack of clear regulations in the cryptocurrency sector is the main reason behind the rise in thefts, CipherTrace said, though more clarity is expected in the near future.

According to the report:

“A tsunami of tough new global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) regulations will roll over the crypto landscape in the coming year.”

CipherTrace further highlighted what it considers a major gap in the current regulatory environment with respect to cross-border crypto payments.

“An analysis of 164 million BTC transactions revealed that cross-border payments from U.S. exchanges to offshore exchanges increased from 45% from the twelve months ending Q1 2017 to 66% in the twelve months ending Q1 2019,” it said.

Finally, cyber criminals are said to have increasingly adopted new techniques such as kidnapping and insider misappropriations to steal cryptocurrency from individuals and companies in the first quarter.

This latest development means that XRP will become the third cryptocurrency index to get listed on NASDAQ’s GID Service after its earlier addition of both Bitcoin and Ethereum indices.

NASDAQ Partners With Brave New Coin to List XRPLX

In an official blog post by NASDAQ earlier this week, the company states that it has partnered with Brave New Coin and would be adding its XRP Liquid Index to its platform. The addition of this product will take place on May 1.

NASDAQ maintains that its collaboration with Brave New Coin will enable it to send real-time Ripple (XRP) index level information on its GID Service. According to the stock market operator, XRPLX provides real-time spot or reference rate for the price of an XRP coin. The price of the cryptocurrency would be quoted in US Dollar.

Brave New Coin in its announcement stated that the XRPLX would only source for data from cryptocurrency exchanges that have the highest trading volumes and an in-depth order book.

To ensure that it provides quality and accurate data, Brave New Coin would be auditing its constituent mix and index methodology in every quarter. At the moment, it is using data from cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and Kraken. However, it would include Coinbase in its next review.

NASDAQ revealed that the methodology which would be used in calculating XRPLX has been audited and compared with the fundamental IOSCO principles. The auditing was however carried out by independent parties, the company added.

Brave New Coin pointed out that the XRPLX was created to meet the demand of the cryptocurrency marketplace to have a single, reliable and fair US Dollar price for XRP. The price is based on real-world trading activity, with the index designed to give traders a market price at which liquidity could either enter or exit an XRP position.

XRPLX Is NASDAQ’s Third Cryptocurrency Index Listing

The stock market operator will be listing its third cryptocurrency index after the earlier addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Earlier this year, NASDAQ partnered with Brave New Coin and went on to add the Bitcoin Liquidity Index (BLX) and the Ethereum Liquidity Index (ELX) on its GID Service.

XRP has now become the third cryptocurrency index NASDAQ is adding to its platform, all thanks to its partnership with Brave New Coin. This latest development indicates that NASDAQ is pushing slowly into the cryptocurrency space.

Over 36 Million Crypto Wallets Created so Far

A study published by market and consumer data provider Statista compiles quarterly figures for a three-year period. The number of blockchain wallet users worldwide has jumped from less than 6.7 million in Q1 2016 to over 34.6 million in Q1 2019. This has involved a constant increase, with every quarter seeing more cryptocurrency wallets than the previous one.

A more detailed graph prepared by Blockchain.com confirms the trend, which dates back to early 2013. During the whole period, there have been two noticeable spikes. The first one occurred between late November 2017 and the end of January 2018, when the number of wallets jumped by 2.5 million. The second started this April – almost 2 million new users have been registered since the beginning of the last month.

The total number of wallet users on April 30 was 36,616,530, according to Blockchain.com’s calculations. The user count towards the end of April 2012 was less than 5,800. The difference, undoubtedly, represents an enormous increase in the number of people involved in the crypto space, despite all the setbacks along the way.

Things to Consider When Choosing a Wallet

Setting up a cryptocurrency wallet is a necessary step for anyone who wants to enter the space. It allows you to acquire, store and spend digital coins. There are many options in the market and your choice should depend on your priorities.

For instance, hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor arguably offer greater security for digital assets. There are also popular desktop wallets like Jaxx or Exodus, online wallets such as Coinpayments, and mobile wallets built for Android and iOS, like Edge. Blockchain.com offers a safe and popular wallet too. All of them support multiple cryptocurrencies.

If you need a light client developed for various platforms, including mobile operating systems as well as Windows, MacOS and Linux, the Bitcoin.com Wallet is an open source, simple and secure tool to buy, store, send and receive bitcoin. The application supports two major cryptocurrencies – bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC).

New users can download and install the app for free and purchase BCH and BTC with a credit card directly in the wallet. As of recently, the option has been available not only to U.S. residents, but also to crypto enthusiasts in the U.K. and Europe. The wallet allows you to easily switch between the two coins using a service called Sideshift without the need for any registration or account creation.

Probably the most attractive feature of the Bitcoin.com Wallet is that it’s a noncustodial platform. That means you’ll be fully in charge of your funds at all times. These and other advantages are some of the reasons for the wallet’s growing popularity. Almost 4 million Bitcoin.com wallets have been created so far. That’s close to 2 million new wallets in just a year.

And while everyone has heard of crypto names like Bitcoin, very few people understand the fundamentals of how cryptocurrencies actually work — especially in the context of personal finance. Here’s what you need to know to prevent you from getting ripped off, and also help you determine if cryptocurrencies are for you:

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is basically a digital way to hold and transfer value online. You can purchase cryptocurrency tokens or coins online (with a credit card or “traditional” money), and there is typically no one person or bank that controls a particular cryptocurrency. There are dozens of different cryptocurrencies available online, the biggest and most well-known ones being Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The value of any cryptocurrency at any given time depends on supply and demand. There’s usually a fixed amount of any currency available at any given moment, so the more people want to use it, the higher the price. In late 2017, for example, the price of a single Bitcoin soared to roughly $20,000 and then took a drive to around $4,000.

How can I get cryptocurrencies?

It’s relatively easy to purchase most cryptocurrencies — and considerably more difficult to unload them.

Sites like CoinBase are exchanges where you can purchase a variety of digital coins. There are also apps called digital wallets that enable you to keep cryptocurrencies yourself and send funds to others with relative ease. With such a wallet, the private keys (that represent ownership) are stored directly on your device.

How do I spend cryptocurrencies?

If you have your own wallet under your own digital lock and key, you can “send” people digital funds. To do this, most people tend to use online vaults, like those provided by Coinbase. The process is very similar to traditional online services: you simply enter the amount of money you want to send and the company you want to pay.

Some vendors accept cryptocurrencies. Microsoft will let you add Bitcoin to your account online using your digital wallet, for example. And there’s a growing list of things you can purchase with cryptocurrency, including everything from fine art to real estate. In many cases, the adoption of cryptocurrency payments has been more of a marketing move than a practical financial one, but it can give cryptocurrency tokens more stability.

On the downside, you should be aware that most of the outlets that accept cryptocurrency also put significant restrictions and limitations on it. In the first place, most only accept the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Second, you may not be able to use the credit for every service. For example, Microsoft will let you use Bitcoin to buy games, movies, and apps in Windows and Xbox stores — but you can’t use it in the Microsoft online store or buy gift cards with it.

Are there any hidden fees?

Of course there are! Most of the independent and startup exchanges that will buy and sell cryptocurrencies for you also charge some sort of fee for the service. And, like real stock brokers, they get you coming and going, whenever you buy or sell a currency. The fees are usually a percentage of the total deposit or payment. However, even if you have to pay 1.5 percent of the total, it’s much less than some other conventional services. Paypal, for example, typically charges closer to 3 percent.

Is it secure?

That depends on your perspective. It is true that cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology ensure that transactions are recorded properly and make it very difficult to hack. Blockchain software is essentially a decentralized ledger that no single person or institution controls because the record of all transactions is maintained across multiple nodes, offering redundancy and making it extremely difficult for any one user to tamper with.

However, if a cryptocurrency token is stolen from a digital wallet, in most cases that means the money is gone for good and untraceable. Furthermore, some vaults have been hacked to the tune of several million dollars, again leaving customers without any recourse because the funds are not guaranteed or insured by any government institution (contrast this with traditional bank accounts in the US, which the FDIC covers for up to $200,000). Last year, over $1 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.

Isn’t it just for criminals?

Historically, crypto was the realm of criminals and digital speculators who were likely attracted by the ease with which Bitcoin can be traded online without compromising anonymity. Unsurprisingly, people who traffic in stolen data and drugs on the dark web were big initial proponents of cryptocurrency. However, it has gained legitimacy over the past few years because of its flexibility for transferring digital money online without the need for any form of institutional banking. It has also gained favor in countries like Venezuela where the local currency is unstable and subject to wild inflationary swings. In these situations, cryptocurrency can offer some protection against political unrest.

Is it better than other online payment services?

In a word, no. The fundamental problem with all cryptocurrencies is the unpredictable fluctuation in their value. So while you hold onto any particular digital denomination, you could be losing (or gaining) money until you use it to buy something or unload it. Traditional money (what crypto proponents refer to as “fiat” currency) tends to be more stable, since it’s supported by governments and a much larger network of global trading markets.

Is it still a big deal?

Yes and no. The speculative bubble of 2017 in the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, did burst — but Bitcoin is still widely used. People do business in Bitcoin in the equivalent of up to $800 million a day. That may sound like a lot, but it’s less than half of what one traditional service, Paypal, does every single day.

However, it is gaining acceptance as a category of currency, largely due to the fact that private companies see a tremendous marketing potential — and another source of revenue — in launching their own cryptocurrencies (see ICOs below).

What are ICOs?

Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a way for companies to raise money by issuing virtual tokens. Much like crowdfunding, you purchase these virtual tokens using traditional money or another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ether, and the company supposedly uses it to create products and expand. It allows the company to avoid the legal and financial requirements for raising venture capital or issuing stock. This new form of crowdfunding is rife with risk, however.

Generally, you can only use the tokens you buy to purchase services or products from that company. So ICOs are worthless anywhere else and there is always the danger that the company will fail to produce anything worth buying — and there’s no way to get your money back. Furthermore, ICOs have been issued in several scams, leaving buyers high and dry. And there’s a considerable speculative market as well, with some secondary markets springing up and traders exchanging the tokens online and driving up their value.

A spin-off concept from ICOs is for private companies to issue their own cryptocurrency to be used only at its own stores. It can also be used like bonus miles or points, redeemable in the future for the company’s services. One big player working on its own cryptocurrency for online money exchanges is Facebook. However, its success — like that of all types of cryptocurrency — will depend on how much people trust it.

Bitcointalk's famous whale Loaded is moving its 40k BTC stash again.https://t.co/t6y909jN2Ehttps://t.co/TrHwb4s2H6 — Antoine Le Calvez (@khannib) May 1, 2019

“Loaded” is an old-school investor famous for their posts on mainstay forum BitcoinTalk. They’ve held 40,000 BTC for years, and every so often, they move it around.

This time, the Bitcoin blockchain charged Loaded just 0.00074227 BTC ($3.93) to send $211.9 million worth of censorship-resistant digital money.

Loaded uses ‘SegWit’ Bitcoin address for cheap fees

Bitcoin’s price was still above $11,000 when Loaded moved 40,000 BTC ($435 million) in January 2018. Back then, they paid a slightly smaller fee of 0.0001 BTC ($1.09) for the transaction.

Seemingly, fees have increased since last year. In the case of Bitcoin, users decide their own network fees, unlike major payment networks like Visa and Mastercard that often charge set amounts to use their centralized systems.

Loaded’s Bitcoin address is actually a little bit special. It starts with “bc1,” which means it uses Segregated Witness (SegWit) technology.

SegWit stretches Bitcoin‘s ‘block size limit‘ from 1MB to around 4MB. This allows miners to fit more transactions into a single block, so more can be confirmed simultaneously.

For SegWit users, this makes for smaller fees, while Bitcoin‘s backlog of unconfirmed transactions shrinks as users (and wallets) adopt the scaling tech.

Still, this serves as a simple reminder: Bitcoin is truly a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” that allows hundreds of millions of dollars to be transferred without permission from anyone, and for just a couple of bucks at a time.

Receiving cryptocurrency payments is an option many companies have explored and implemented in the past few years. Online merchants can use a growing number of platforms to process orders paid with digital coins and Coingate is one such established service in this niche.

Payment Gateway Supports Crypto Options

Coingate allows web-based businesses to accept payments from their customers in several of the most popular cryptocurrencies. That includes bitcoin cash (BCH), which is known for its fast and low cost transactions. The payment gateway, developed by a Lithuanian company, automatically settles payments in euros, U.S. dollars, or BTC. The platform selects the best conversion rate from several exchanges.

Using Coingate, online stores can set the price of their items in fiat currency and the system calculates in real-time their crypto equivalent. Then customers can pay with bitcoin cash, for example, and the merchant will receive the amount in a preferred currency. There’s a 1% processing fee for the service.

To integrate the payment gateway on their website, companies need to choose between several options. They can take advantage of Coingate’s ready-made integrations for e-commerce content management systems or web billing platforms such as Woocommerce, Magento, Prestashop, and Opencart.

Alternatively, merchants can use the payment platform’s developer API, which can be configured for any website. Users can also add payment buttons that can facilitate the processing of donations or simple payments for a limited number of products.

To start accepting bitcoin cash, merchants have to sign up with Coingate first and then pass a verification procedure if they choose fiat settlements. If they wish to receive only crypto payments, then no verification is needed in most cases.

Direct BCH payments can also be accepted through a mobile app developed by Bitcoin.com for Android. Bitcoin Cash Register (BCH) is a free and simple point of sale software which requires only a public key or an extended public key linked to your wallet. The application is easy to set up and no account or registration is needed to use it. Amounts can be displayed in over 150 fiat currencies.

Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), said during the company’s Q1 earnings call that the ongoing bear market has been “helpful” for Bakkt, which was initially scheduled to launch last December, then delayed to January, then again indefinitely.

“It’s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency [market] went into what they call a winter, [because] it took some of the heat off the timetable to launch,” Sprecher said, adding that this was just one benefit.

Another benefit is that many crypto startups’ valuations have declined, creating buying opportunities for Bakkt, he said, explaining:

“We’ve actually been looking at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn’t have been available to us if the market was really hot, because the valuations were really hot.”

Indeed, on Monday Bakkt announced it had acquired Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC), which is developing a crypto-asset storage platform. (The price was not disclosed.)

That being said, the industry is continuing to mature, and Bakkt is working to help it do so, Sprecher said. The company has brought on a number of engineers through its recent acquisitions (Bakkt has also acquired some assets, including personnel, from Rosenthal Collins Group, an independent futures commission merchant).

“There’s a lot of interest still in this market,” he said.

Regulatory questions

One of the primary causes for Bakkt’s delays are regulatory in nature – specifically, it is widely believed that the firm’s plan to custody bitcoin itself under federal supervision and settle contracts through its parent firm’s clearinghouse have placed it in a regulatory gray area.

While Sprecher did not specifically address what the holdups were, he did note that regulators are still trying to understand the asset class and how to regulate it.

“You can’t really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted so the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said, adding:

“It’s going well now, there were a lot of things that had to get sorted out with jurisdiction and custody and … banks and those issues that in my mind need to be resolved before adoption of the asset class and we’ve been at the forefront of [this].”

The bear market has helped in this sense as well, by giving both regulators and legislators in the U.S. some additional time to determine how they might eventually regulate this space, Sprecher said.

Sprecher did not address how much ICE has spent on Bakkt to date, though Scott Hill, chief financial officer at ICE, previously said that the firm planned to invest between $20 and $25 million in 2019. This figure comes on top of $182 million Bakkt raised from investors.

According to a report from crypto news outlet CoinDesk on May 1, the Chinese bitcoin (BTC) billionaire posted to a public chat on local messenger WeChat on Wednesday, outlining that the sale will offer a total supply of 1 billion tokens, priced at $1 apiece, with a minimum buy-in of $1 million.

Zhao — who runs a major Chinese BTC over-the-counter trading desk and is the founder of Singapore-based DFund — reportedly further claimed that $500 million tokens had already been vouched for. He is cited as having said that “only qualified foreign investors will be allowed to invest,” and that all those interested must make a soft commitment to the IEO by May 5.

Once investors will have had a chance to review the token’s white paper, they will then be able to either cancel their soft commitment, or cement it as a hard commitment by providing a 10% deposit, Zhao reportedly added. The shareholder further outlined that:

“The system works on a first-in, first-served basis. If all tokens are fully allocated, we will not have to run the IEO to the retail channel, it will be like a private placement.”

The new token has reportedly been characterized by Zhao as a hybrid of the model used for crypto exchange Binance’s native token binance coin (BNB) — which is used by Binance users to pay for exchange trading fees — and Bitfinex’s erstwhile BFX token.

As previously reported, BFX tokens were issued by the exchange in 2016 to compensate Bitfinex users affected by a major hack, which had resulted in the theft of around 120,000 BTC.

Upon Zhao’s first revelation of the Bitfinex’s alleged IEO and proprietary exchange token plans on April 29, the news sparked a wave of community concern in light of the lengthy history of controversies that have beset both Bitfinex and affiliated USD stablecoin company Tether.

As recently reported, the New York Attorney General’s office has this month alleged that Bitfinex lost $850 million in user deposits, and had subsequently secretly covered up the shortfall using funds from Tether — the latter of which has itself come under renewed criticism for allegedly being only backed 74% by USD reserves.

In an official statement, Tether rebuffed the allegations, stating that the “New York Attorney General’s court filings were written in bad faith and were riddled with false assertions, including in regard to the purported $850 million loss.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cant-fix-venezuela-i-should-know,"Today marks a week since I left my home in Venezuela.

So, here I am, watching the news since 6 a.m., haven’t separated from my phone all day. I’m worried about my loved ones, wondering if I could have done more before leaving, but knowing I had to leave anyway.

I left everything I knew behind, but I also fled an escalating crisis that jeopardized my income as a remote worker in the crypto space, where I’ve been now for years.

For the Venezuelans using cryptocurrency as a tool to survive the economic consequences of a brutal socialist dictatorship, receiving support from the international community has been vital to the reformation process. The trouble is that this attention has quickly deteriorated into a double-edged sword: a trend.

In the last few years, Venezuela has become a favorite pop culture reference in crypto, where bystanders – usually from a privileged background and perspective – spout their ill-wisdom about Venezuelan socialism, economy and migration.

This situation is particularly common in crypto. People armed with good intentions and misinformation about how Venezuela’s economy works – or better said, how it doesn’t work – spread their confusion and often diminish an extremely painful experience being shared by millions of Venezuelans.

So let me, as someone who used bitcoin to survive in Venezuela, clear up the misconceptions: Bitcoin can’t fix the situation in Venezuela.

There are no official statistics of how many crypto wallets there are in Venezuela. There’s no way to know how many each person owns. What it is very clear is that beyond a couple of businesses that accept this form of payment and a few trusted exchange platforms online, there are no services for crypto users available in the country.

No ATMs. No prepaid debit cards. Just assumptions.

The fallacy that bitcoin could “save” a country’s whole economy assumes the country meets all the requirements for mainstream adoption. Just to start, there would be needed widespread computer and financial literacy, reliable electricity infrastructure, stable internet service and an economy that not only allows the majority of citizens to count on a device to keep their digital wallets but also the safe migration from fiat money to digital money.

As we can see, the fact that Venezuela serves as a use case for bitcoin does not mean that it currently has the circumstances for broad cryptocurrency adoption.

The hyperinflation has stepped all over the Bolivar, as it also impacts US dollar-based prices that rise on a daily basis. So using bitcoin to get dollars, which is what many Venezuelans currently do, is still problematic and vulnerable to inflation issues.

There’s also the mining. Venezuela is famous for its off-the-charts rates of bitcoin transactions and mining activity. But the reality is that having access to cryptocurrency is limited to earning freelance income, trading and mining, which unless you are wealthy enough to own your own mining farm, isn’t a feasible option for most Venezuelans.

The crypto misconception

Foreign initiatives to help Venezuelans have instead revealed widespread ignorance about the actual problems that Venezuelans face.

Working personally as a contact for the crypto charity GiveCrypto, owned by Coinbase, during 2018, I found a common problem in this initiative that others have followed: the gigantic misinterpretation of how to help from outside.

In the case of GiveCrypto, the goal was unreachable from the start: to feed 300 people with $100 in bitcoin. That’s 33 cents per person. To anyone with an understanding of the economic situation of the country, hyperinflation wouldn’t be this underestimated. Sadly, it’s quite commonplace.

And this isn’t an isolated case of donations given without much of strategy based on reality.

Crypto donations are very popular nowadays, like in the case of AirTM, which has just announced that will be teaming up with MakerDao on its goal to raise $1 million to distribute between its users in Venezuela, with a goal of giving away $10 to each aid recipient. (Such a small amount doesn’t serve as savings or investment, as it easily vanishes for a week’s worth of expenses.)

Despite all the international efforts to distribute crypto in Venezuela, so far there aren’t any solutions able to make a sustainable and adequate difference beyond what a similar dollar donation could have achieved. The important thing for these foreign brands appears to be just cramming a blockchain-shaped peg into any hole.

Silver lining

Despite this situation, outsider opinions don’t determine the actual impact of crypto adoption for Venezuelans.

It’s true that cryptocurrency is very useful for a specific range of activities that support survival, as an income for freelancers, as a form of remittance for families to receive U.S. dollars at minimum commission, and – when the internet and electricity allow it – for those with an extra income who mine from their GPUs or miners.

I do believe that bitcoin has the capacity to influence Venezuela’s financial landscape in a positive way. As cash loses its value, citizens are pushed toward digital money and eventually, that money could include cryptocurrencies.

While we are in this process, Venezuelans must stop being seen as a punchline for misleading arguments about the benefits of bitcoin. The country situation has shown the many phases of an economic crisis, and there are invaluable lessons that we have learned that give a whole new twist to our view on financial solutions.

That said, the crypto industry needs to stop viewing Venezuela as a testing ground for wild ideas and start viewing us as what we really are: irreplaceable partners in the financial revolution.

By CCN.com: Bitcoin played a role in staging the Easter Sunday suicide bombing in Sri Lanka that killed 253 civilians, according to Israeli blockchain intelligence firm Whitestream.

The agency revealed that the ISIS used Canada-based payment gateway CoinPayments to convert bitcoins to fiat money. The firm identified large scale transactions between the wallets that ISIS used to raise contributions and the bitcoin accounts held by CoinPayments.

Whitestream found that the balances in the payment company’s wallets surged from $500,000 to $4.5 million just one day before the Easter attacks. The firm added that the CoinPayments’ balances dropped back to $500,000 right after the deadly attacks took place. The payment company in question admitted that they had processed high-volume transactions. However, it denied having any knowledge about the money’s links with terrorist groups.

“CoinPayments admits that their wallet was involved but denied that it is connected to ISIS,” Whitestream told Globes. “It’s possible that the company is not aware of the usage of their wallets, perhaps because ISIS uses straw companies [to] transfer the money.”

The ISIS-Bitcoin Connection

Whitestream, founded by Itsik Levy and Uri Bornstein, confirmed that it was monitoring ISIS-linked bitcoin wallets from the past two years. The firm eventually maximized its focus on one bitcoin wallet that was receiving donations actively over different periods. It succeeded in verifying two transactions originated from the bitcoin wallet address listed on the ISIS fundraising website.

Levy said they were able to trace the transactions back to CoinPayments, indicating that the payment processing company knowingly/unknowingly was facilitating the ISIS funding campaign.

“Our assumption is that the terrorist organization probably possesses many bitcoin addresses through CoinPayments, with every donation sent to a different address,” Levy told Globes. “On the day before the Sri Lanka terror attacks, we identified two relatively big transactions at this address with bitcoins worth about $9,800.”

Whitestream in February had named CoinPayments for facilitating bitcoin-enabled donation campaigns for Hamas, a Palestine-based Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist group. Meanwhile, the firm believed that cryptocurrency-based payment and exchange companies were working in a largely unregulated environment. It was making it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit them for financing their attacks around the globe.

This has led to rampant claims of bogus trading volumes as some exchanges use wash trading or other ploys to boost volume and the appearance of relevance. The Blockchain Transparency Institute has been at the forefront of removing the varnish of fake crypto trading estimating that up to 95% of crypto exchanges show wash trading. The fact that so much of the crypto trading is fictitious undermines the entire industry.

To counter the fake trading, 12 cryptocurrency exchanges have partnered with CoinMarketCap as founding members of the Data Accountability and Transparency Alliance (DATA). According to CoinMarketCap, the DATA exchange partners have committed to providing the following:

mandatory data

self-reported information on an ongoing basis. While providing mandatory data is a prerequisite for being a DATA partner, a partner will go above and beyond to contribute to shaping the standards, strategies, and measures according to the objectives stated above.

As of June 14, 2019, trade and order book data will be required for ALL crypto exchanges via an API.

The data should enable CoinMarketCap to determine measures such as liquidity, order book depth, spreads, and more. CoinMarketCap states:

“Any exchange that does not provide this mandatory data to us via a new or updated summary endpoint will be excluded from all price and adjusted volume calculations on the site.”

So these fake crypto exchanges will be shown the door.

The 12 exchanges which have joined the Alliance include: Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, Huobi, Liquid, UpBit, IDEX, OceanEX, Gate.io, KuCoin, HitBTC, and Bitfinex. CoinMarketCap says others will follow.

Founding partner Huobi Group, a company that claims over $1 trillion in annual turnover, issued a statement on the DATA initiative:

“The issue of fake trading volumes is a real one in the industry and people have a right to know that the numbers provided by exchanges are legitimate. We think there should be no exceptions and we see something like DATA as a natural next step as our industry grows in both maturity and mainstream acceptance,” said Livio Weng, CEO of Huobi Global.

Huobi states that its operations are “known for its strong liquidity” and accurate trading volume numbers are of high importance.

Huobi says it consistently ranks as one of the top exchanges in terms of liquidity.

“When it comes to liquidity, or any other measure, the public should be able to easily verify and decide who is trustworthy and who is not. That’s why we think efforts like the DATA alliance are positive steps forward,” said Ross Zhang, Head of Marketing for Huobi Group.

Huobi said its representatives will facilitate in-depth discussions, suggestions, strategies, and planning with other DATA members at biannual industry roundtables on crypto data transparency and its impacts.",2019-05-14,https://dailyhodl.com/2019/05/02/malaysia-launching-worlds-first-crypto-powered-city-expects-3-million-visitors-a-year/,"‎‎‎ ‏‏‎

Malaysia is reportedly set to become the site of the world’s first crypto city, where cash will be shunned in favor of a new cryptocurrency called DMI.

The government is developing 835 acres of Malacca City into a tourist destination for the crypto curious, reports The Sun.

“DMI is a company that provides mobile enterprise, business intelligence and cybersecurity services and it has collaborated with the Melaka Straits City on this project. Visitors will be able to exchange normal money for DMI coins when they arrive in the city…

Visitors will have to know how to use blockchain technology in the form of the DMI coin if they wish to pay for any public services during their stay.

Other similar projects are underway across the world as companies battle to create the crypto-destination of the future but the Melaka Straits City development aims to be the first blockchain city in Asia.”

The development is reportedly backed by the Chinese government, which strongly supports blockchain technology, but is extremely weary of crypto. Project lead Lim Keng Kai says,

“Our company is using cutting-edge blockchain technologies and integrating those into the traditional industry to make Malaysia a world-class tourist destination.

We have the government approval to remediate this land and came up with some great plans for the area.”

The development will be called Melaka Straits City. Upon entry into the blockchain city, tourists can convert their money into DMI through their mobile phones or computers.

“The DMI web application will be available on PC and the mobile applications will run on Android and iOS devices to provide flexibility regardless of the preference of the individuals.”

Developers anticipate the blockchain city will attract up to three million visitors a year.

Institutional Investors See Crypto’s Potential

Fidelity Investments released the results of its new survey and study on institutional investors’ crypto asset investment strategies on Thursday. Noting a significant rise in interest among intermediaries and institutions, the company wrote:

Institutional engagement is here … institutional investors are overwhelmingly favorable about the appealing characteristics of digital assets. Nearly seven in ten respondents cited certain characteristics of digital assets as appealing.

The survey finds 47% of respondents “appreciate that digital assets are an innovative technology play” while 46% are attracted to their low correlation to other assets. Meanwhile, 27% like their high upside potential and 25% favor their decentralization aspect. Among respondents, financial advisors (74%) and family offices (80%) view the characteristics of digital assets most favorably.

The survey was conducted between Nov. 26 last year and Feb. 8 by Greenwich Associates on behalf of the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology. Participants were 441 U.S. institutional investors, including pensions, family offices, crypto and traditional hedge funds, financial advisors, endowments and foundations.

Fidelity Investments is one of the world’s largest financial services providers. The company claims to have more than $7.3 trillion in client assets under administration. Its subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets, offers a platform for securing, trading and supporting digital assets.

5-Year Horizon

Fidelity’s study shows that “Institutional investors are finding appeal in digital assets and many are looking to invest more in digital assets over the next five years,” elaborating:

About 22% of institutional investors already have some exposure to digital assets, with most investments having been made within the past three years … Four in ten respondents say they are open to future investments in digital assets over the next five years.

Out of all respondents, 47% view digital assets as having a place in their investment portfolios. 32% see them as part of an alternative asset class, while 15% believe they have their own independent asset class. Among the 47%, 72% would buy investment products that hold digital assets, 57% would buy crypto assets directly, and 57% would buy investment products that hold crypto companies.

“We’ve seen a maturation of interest in digital assets from early adopters, like crypto hedge funds, to traditional institutional investors like family offices and endowments,” Tom Jessop, President of Fidelity Digital Assets, detailed. “More institutional investors are engaging with digital assets, either directly or through service providers.” The survey also noted:

Among the obstacles to digital asset investments cited by respondents were price volatility, lack of clarity around regulation, the limited track record and lack of fundamentals.

Funds and Endowments

A report by Morgan Stanley published in October last year reveals a growing number of crypto funds and crypto assets under management. According to Cryptofundresearch, an estimated 220 crypto funds were created last year and crypto assets under management amounted to approximately $7.11 billion in July.

In addition, according to a survey of 150 endowments conducted by Global Custodian, The Trade Crypto and Bitgo in the fourth quarter of last year, 94% stated that they invested in crypto assets either directly or through a fund. Jonathan Watkins, Managing Editor of Global Custodian and The Trade Crypto, commented:

Despite the widely-publicised concerns around regulation, custody and liquidity, endowments have been factoring crypto-related investments into their allocations, and very few are showing intentions of stepping away.

A failure to secure a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the 50-week moving average, currently at $5,418, could invite profit taking, yielding a fall back to $5,000.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price hit 5.5-month highs above $5,700 soon before press time, bolstering both short- and long-term bullish views.

The cryptocurrency market leader rose to $5,714 at 08:340 UTC, the highest level since Nov. 18, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. BTC was last seen trading at $5,682, representing a 5.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

The rally to 5.5-month highs has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the cryptocurrency’s recent bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) after a drop when the recent Bitfinex controversy hit the news.

Further, it validates April’s bullish close above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average of the price.

Last but not the least, with the recent bounce from levels below $5,000, the cryptocurrency has invalidated a strong bearish indicator pattern, as seen in the chart below. As a result, prices could rise to $6,000 over the next few days.

Daily chart

As seen above (prices via Bitstamp), the 30-day MA has lived up to its reputation of being strong support by reversing the price pullback from highs above $5,600 to $5,000.

More importantly, with the bounce, the relative strength index (RSI) seems to have found acceptance above the descending trendline, representing a bearish divergence confirmed on April 24.

In the past, BTC has suffered significant price pullbacks following the confirmation of the bearish divergence of the RSI. This time, however, the pattern failed – a sign of strong bullish sentiment.

What’s more, the Chaikin money flow index, used to measure the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days), has risen from 0.0036 to 0.12 in the last few days, confirming the uptrend in price.

So, BTC could close well above the April 23 high of $5,627 today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,000.

On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $5,780 (June 2018 bottom) and $5,880 (August 2018 bottom), as discussed yesterday.

Weekly chart

Bitcoin has breached the 50-week MA resistance, currently at $5,418, on the weekly chart. However, confirmation of the breakout is needed in the form of a close above $5,418 on Sunday (UTC).

The case for a pullback to levels below $5,000 would strengthen if the buyers fail to keep prices above the key average for the second week.

SAN FRANCISCO — The Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook plans a cryptocurrency-based payment system that it could launch for billions of users worldwide.

The system would use a digital coin similar to bitcoin, but different in that Facebook would aim to keep the coin's value stable. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have been susceptible to wild fluctuations in value.

It could reportedly undermine credit cards by sidestepping the processing fees that generate much of their revenue.

The Journal report cited unidentified people familiar with the matter. It said Facebook is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to launch the network. Facebook's plans may include ways to financially reward users who interact with ads or other features.

Facebook says only that it is exploring many different applications for cryptocurrency technology.

By CCN.com: The bitcoin bear market of 2018 was a disaster for most crypto fans, but it was a boon for the highly-anticipated cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt. That’s the opinion of NYSE chairman Jeffrey Sprecher, the CEO of Bakkt’s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

Sprecher’s ICE — along with Microsoft, Starbucks, and BCG — is bankrolling Bakkt, whose CEO is Sprecher’s wife, Kelly Loeffler.

sprecher: bitcoin winter was good for bakkt

Sprecher tried to put a positive spin on the Crypto Winter by saying it gave Bakkt time to build out the platform and buy up bitcoin at relatively cheap prices.

“It’s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter,” Sprecher said on a call with analysts. “That took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch.”

Bakkt — which will facilitate bitcoin futures trading for institutional investors — electrified the crypto community in August 2018, when it announced its imminent launch.

Bakkt will provide custody and price discovery for bitcoin — which is regulated as a commodity by the CFTC — in a way that’s designed to be free from market manipulation and fraud.

bakkt launch delayed multiple times

Bakkt was supposed to go live in January 2019, but the roll-out has been postponed several times amid regulatory delays. Right now, there is no set launch date for the new platform.

On the positive side, Jeffrey Sprecher says the delays enabled Bakkt to recruit new talent and make key acquisitions.

“We’ve actually looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn’t have been available to us if the market had been really hot.”

On April 29, Bakkt acquired crypto-custody firm Digital Asset Custody for an undisclosed amount. The purchase is part of Bakkt’s efforts to win regulatory approval for its crypto products.

sprecher: bitcoin will survive downturns

In 2018, the crypto market was roiled by bitcoin price plunges, mass layoffs, and bitcoin evangelists fleeing the industry.

Despite these setbacks, Sprecher remains bullish about the future of virtual currencies.

Sprecher is confident that digital assets have a bright future, notwithstanding the recent downturn. “The unequivocal answer is yes [crypto will survive],” Sprecher said in November 2018.

Moreover, Sprecher says bitcoin is the yardstick by which all others cryptocurrencies are measured — and that won’t change.

“Somehow bitcoin has lived in a swamp and survived. There are thousands of other tokens that you could argue are better, but yet bitcoin continues to survive, thrive, and attract attention.”

jeff sprecher: bakkt is a ‘moonshot bet’

Sprecher doubled-down on his bullish stance in February 2019, when he called Bakkt a “moonshot bet” for Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the NYSE.

“It’s a bit of a moonshot bet and it’s been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ICE typically does businesses.” “Bakkt has its own offices, its own management team. They’re well along in building out an infrastructure that I think you’ll see launch later this year.”

Similarly, J. Christopher Giancarlo, the retiring chairman of the CFTC, foresees a massive spike in interest in cryptocurrencies with the launch of bitcoin futures products.",2019-05-03 11:48:51+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/myanmars-central-bank-warns-public-not-to-use-crypto-after-series-of-scams-reported,"The Central Bank of Myanmar has urged consumers to stop trading cryptocurrencies amid fears that inexperienced users could lose money, Southeast Asian news outlet The Irrawaddy reported on May 3.

In a statement obtained by the website, the central bank said it had received reports of several scams targeting those who lack understanding about virtual currencies.

Authorities in Myanmar, also known as Burma, say the likes of bitcoin (BTC,) ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC) are being traded in the country through Facebook profiles as well as websites.

According to the report, the central bank has stressed that the use of crypto is unauthorized in Myanmar — however, the country does not have any mechanisms or legal frameworks in place to regulate or block their use.

U Than Lwin, a former deputy governor at the central bank, told The Irrawaddy that price volatility, the lack of consumer protection and the difficulty of taking legal action were three reasons “why investing in cryptocurrencies should be avoided.” He added:

“The price is unstable all the time. Trading cryptocurrencies could result in losing everything you invested in them. It’s like gambling.”

In 2018, Myanmar’s Ministry of Home Affairs issued a similar warning after receiving reports that people living in rural areas were being targeted for investment by crypto promoters because they were uninformed about the market.

However, the government’s stance on crypto trading does not mean that the nation is also avoiding blockchain, the tech supporting most cryptocurrencies. Last month, the central banks of Thailand and Myanmar endorsed an ETH-based remittance system designed for sending payments between the two countries.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/68-of-global-millionaires-already-invested-or-plan-to-invest-in-crypto-by-2022-survey,"68% of global high-net-worth individuals have already invested or are planning to invest in crypto by the end of 2022, according to a survey by Dubai-based financial consultancy firm deVere Group released on May 3.

DeVere group has more than $10 billion in assets under advice, with more than 80,000 clients located in more than 100 countries.

More than two-thirds of global individuals whose assets’ value is equivalent or greater than 1 million British pounds (GBP) or $1.3 million, will be invested in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and ripple (XRP), the report notes.

The new survey included more than 700 deVere clients as respondents, located in major global countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Qatar, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.

DeVere founder and CEO Nigel Green has outlined five major factors that drive global high-net-worth individuals to keep an eye on crypto, not including the Fear Of Missing Out, or FOMO. According to Green, the first major reason is that cryptocurrencies are borderless, which enables the asset to be available everywhere all over the globe.

The other factors include the fact that crypto suits the general global trend of increasing digitalization, the capability of crypto to provide solutions for real-life issues such as international remittances and providing services for the world’s assessed two billion person unbanked population, as well as acceptance by the younger generation and the active involvement by institutional investors.

Green further stated that once confidence is in place, “the sky is the limit for cryptocurrencies,” concluding that the new poll demonstrated a “justified international surge in crypto-optimism.

The survey has come amid the recent major bull market move, with bitcoin breaking the $5,800 threshold for the first time in 2019.



Yesterday, the U.S.-based asset management firm Fidelity Investments released a new survey finding that 22% of institutional investors already own digital assets.",,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crypto-industry-speaks-out-against-bitcoinsv-delisting-200413515,"BitcoinSV ( ) hit the headlines in April after a number of prominent cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Kraken and ShapeShift delisted the alt-currency. There's been strong sentiment—both positive and negative—from a variety of crypto market participants in the aftermath, as the digital currency industry continues its struggle to be taken seriously and gain mainstream acceptance.

BSV is the result of a contentious hard fork of the blockchain. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright and Calvin Ayer were behind the hard fork. BSV raised Cash‘s block size limit from 32MB to 128MB. Wright has also claimed he's actually the mysterious Bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. That, however, has been widely discredited. It's just one of many controversies swirling around the now-debased token.

Myriad Reasons, Lots of Drama

What triggered the delistings? Many believe the primary reason had more to do with the number of exchange CEOs who personally dislike Wright. Some feel this was borne out when Binance founder Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter in mid April to call Wright out. But others tweeted their disagreement arguing ""An attack against one is an attack against all."" Still, on April 15th, Binance officially announced the delisting on their site.

Kraken, in its delisting announcement the following day, attributed their decision to other factors:

""The team behind BitcoinSV have engaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for. It started with fraudulent claims, escalating to threats and legal action, with the BSV team suing a number of people speaking out against them.""

Jimmy Nguyen, global ambassador for BSV responded:

“It’s absolutely ridiculous that any business, let alone a cryptocurrency exchange, would use Twitter polls to make a serious business decision like delisting an asset in a way that could harm the value of millions of investors worldwide.”

The crux of the issue, from his perspective, explains Cyril Alvarez Adriaansen, head of Blockchain at collaborative banking platform 2gether, isn't personal feelings between industry players. Rather, the very principle of the centralized exchange goes against the decentralized promises of blockchain technology.

“This should worry both market participants and regulators regardless of their feelings towards the leadership of Bitcoin SV. I believe it is critical that exchanges be held to high standards of neutrality and impartiality. Until regulation catches up, market participants should demand that centralized exchanges establish a self-regulatory framework surrounding listing/delisting of coins, fake trading volume, and many other issues that currently plague the industry.”

As well, the success of a coin should not be dependent on whether it's listed or delisted, says Pedro Anderson, COO and co-founder of Winding Tree. However, Anderson stresses he's not supportive of tokens—and founders—that are dishonest.

""It's a pay to play game with exchanges so it doesn't reflect the need or viability of the coin. But in this case, it does seem the only logical action not just on Binance's part but other exchanges, such as Kraken, who've done the same. The guy is a charlatan and it's a joke that something like this could be listed in the first place.""

Another contingent within the cryptosphere sees Bitcoin as the only legitimate cryptocurrency. Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo, a multi-chain platform, believes Bitcoin forks are largely controversial because most represent existential threats to Bitcoin’s ( ) existence.

“For many of the most notable Bitcoin forks, success is a zero-sum game, with the idea being to dethrone Bitcoin and outright replace it, eventually becoming the so-called “true” Bitcoin. Despite the ongoing fights to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance however, it is important to remember that forks can live alongside their ancestors. Forks can not only coexist, but they can symbiotically thrive so long as their value propositions are sufficiently different.”

Given the powerful position Binance's Zhao holds within the cryptoverse, Matthew Finestone, director at Loopring, the open-source protocol for building decentralized exchanges, views the BSV-Binance delisting as an interesting move that also highlights some of the current issues plaguing the asset class.

“The drama and nonsense around BCH-SV have been deleterious for the ecosystem. So while I support the delisting, it’s not lost on me that this mirrors the unilateral gatekeeping crypto is meant to neuter. While I recognize the seemingly resounding sentiment in favor of this move in the crypto community, it could, in fact, be argued that it only amplifies the need for truly open exchanges.”

Others see the action as completely laudable. Gordon Chen, CEO and co-founder of Neutral, an open financial protocol building a suite of financial products on-chain, thinks the delisting shows that the crypto industry holds players accountable.",

A mysterious crypto whale worth more than $35 million revealed his meteoric Bitcoin price target. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: A mysterious crypto whale set a meteoric Bitcoin price target, and he revealed it in an exclusive interview with CCN.com.

The anonymous Bitcoin whale, known only by his crypto addresses, has accumulated a fortune of more than 7,000 BTC. The crypto holdings are worth $35 million USD at the time of writing, and they’re mostly held in this wallet.

He let CCN.com in on some seasoned technical analysis insights that suggest the Bitcoin price is well on its way to eclipsing the $50,000 mark.

Mystery Whale Caught the Crypto Big During the Early Days

The Bitcoin giant invested in the world’s leading cryptocurrency back in the early days. From there he picked a number of solid investments – Binance and Ethereum among them – growing a substantial fortune

“I actively invested in Bitcoin back in those years when only in small circles knew about it. Before investing, I conducted a personal analysis of Bitcoin technology. I saw a great prospect for society in him and the financial system as a whole, which had already begun to change. We are still in the beginning and I see a huge potential in the cryptocurrency market and the blockchain technology.”

Despite maintaining a positive outlook, the investor states that “not everybody will survive the crypto winter,” indicating that it may not yet be over in his eyes.

$50,000 Bitcoin Price Waits on the Horizon

While macroeconomic predictions should always be taken with a pinch of salt, the people who have made millions trading are perhaps the best ones to ask, and the enigmatic crypto investor had a lot to say on future price action.

“I think we will see $50,000 Bitcoin in the next three to five years.”

“I believe that we are either already seeing a bull market return. If not, we’ll see it in the coming months. One key indicator is the increase in exchange and OTC trading. Bitcoin consolidation above the 200-day moving average and the approximation of halving are also bullish.”

Anonymously Investing in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain

The Bitcoin investor is not fully convinced that we have re-entered the bull market. However, he did state the market is likely headed that way soon.

After becoming an early BTC adopter and investing in Binance tokens within months of launch, the anonymous Bitcoin investor said he turned his gaze to Roobee, an AI-based investment service, following in the footsteps of the anonymous trader who made over $200 million trading Ethereum.

He said he transferred over 200 bitcoins to Roobee with a message saying, “In Roobee I trust,” and did it all without disclosing his identity.

An aspect of cryptocurrency technology which is both feared and lauded is privacy. Pseudonymity or anonymity is available to crypto users when transacting, a hotly-debated topic. Indeed, transferring vast amounts in total secrecy can often conjure images of illicit activity.

However, the potential to make major anonymous investments highlights, once again, an important use case for crypto. The new technology can shield users from would-be attackers seeking to target high-value victims. While grassroots support is inarguably the driving force for cryptocurrency adoption, it never hurts to appeal to influential multi-millionaires at the same time.",2019-05-04 15:30:45+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/celsius-wallet-app-offers-interest-and-loans-for-your-cryptocurrency/,"Celsius Wallet App Offers Interest and Loans for Your Cryptocurrency

""It's a gambling device... there's been a lot of frauds connected with it. There's been disappearances, so there's a lot lost on it. Bitcoin hasn't produced anything,"" Buffett told a group of reporters ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting at the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.

""It doesn't do anything. It just sits there. It's like a seashell or something, and that is not an investment to me,"" he added.

Buffett even compared the cryptocurrency to a button on his jacket.

""I'll tear off a button here. What I'll have here is a little token...I'll offer it to you for $1000, and I'll see if I can get the price up to $2000 by the end of the day... But the button has one use and it's a very limited use,"" Buffett said.

Buffett had previously called bitcoin ""rat poison squared,"" and Berkshire's vice chairman Charlie Munger said trading in cryptocurrencies is ""just dementia."" Bitcoin rallied to a six-month high on Friday, rebounding from a steep loss last year.

However, the Oracle of Omaha acknowledged the blockchain technology that bitcoin is built on has some promise.

""Blockchain...is very big, but it didn't need bitcoin. J.P. Morgan of course came out with their own cryptocurrency,"" Buffett said Saturday.

What Is Odyssey?

Odyssey is a blockchain-based platform helping to tokenize peer-to-peer sharing economies like Lyft, WyzAnt, or Airbnb. The ecosystem relies on participation from both sides of the two-sided marketplace, with consumers incentivized to review providers in ocoins (OCN), Odyssey’s proprietary ERC-20 cryptocurrency token. In 2018 the project launched a second OCP token, which started airdropping to OCN holders November 2018.

The Odyssey platform already has a mobile crypto wallet payment service called OCPay, and its OCNEX cryptocurrency exchange went online in October 2018. It appears to have gone offline since then, though.

While it doesn’t get a lot of media attention, this ambitious project is aiming for a great target by putting the sharing economy on the blockchain. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates, the P2P sharing market will generate $335 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Uber (valued at $72 billion, as of August 2018) was the most valuable unicorn tech company for a long time, and it made co-founder and ex-CEO Travis Kalanick a multi-billionaire.

Other U.S.-based unicorn companies include:

WeWork ($45 billion as of November 2018), a coworking and officesharing company

Airbnb ($38 billion as of March 2018), a roomsharing platform

Lyft ($15.1 billion as of June 2018), Uber’s ridesharing competition

Coinbase ($8 billion as of October 2018), a cryptocurrency exchange.

The Singapore-based project’s Chief Advisors include Tron CEO Justin Sun and Avazu Holding CEO Yi Shi, and both the TRON Foundation and QTUM Foundation are listed as cornerstone investors, along with Game.com Founder & CEO Le Xu and BlockVC Founder Kevin Hsu.

Can this crypto dream team tokenize and monetize this sleeping dragon of the shared economy?

We’ll begin answering this question with an examination of OCN and OCP, the proprietary ERC-20 cryptocurrency tokens used on the Odyssey platform.

OCN and OCP Cryptocurrency Summary

The peak price of OCN so far was $0.110455 on January 27, 2018. There is a total coin supply of 10,000,000,000 OCN.

The Odyssey ICO ended January 23, 2018 and raised $50,000,000 worth of ETH, selling 40 percent of the total token supply (4,000,000,000 OCN).

OCN is technically airdropped, but it’s done so in a manner similar to Proof-of-Stake mining. Users build credit by holding OCN and participating in the Odyssey ecosystem (i.e. providing services or reviewing providers). Distributions are then made on terms set by the Odyssey team proportionate to each node’s credit ratings.

Credit will be important in Odyssey, as shared economies are trust-based systems. Services like Uber and Doordash require minimum ratings of their drivers, and both drivers and riders can decline a transaction if they don’t like the ratings. Odyssey’s credit system moves this system to smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

OCN is used to pay for tokenized transactions on the Odyssey network.

Over $6 million worth of OCN is traded on a daily basis. OCN is accepted on a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges, including Gate.io, LBank, Bittumb, Huobi, and Upbit. Trading pairs include ETH, BTC, and USDT.

As an ERC-20 token, OCN can be stored in any ERC20-compatible cryptocurrency wallet, such as MyEtherWallet and the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.

OCP began airdropping to OCN holders proportionate to the average of their OCN holdings during the airdrop period. 10,000,000,000 OCP tokens were minted, and they’re meant to be used as payments on the Odyssey platform.

Many industry analysts and Reddit forums are abuzz with wonder as to why two currencies are necessary for a platform seeking to unify shared economy platforms. Some see them as red flags that the project is just a cash grab by the founders.

Shared Problems in Shared Economies

While P2P services seem ideal on the surface, the shared economy is not without its dark sides. Both users and providers in marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber have gripes with the services. The best way to break down these important problems are by category:

Home-sharing – Marketplaces like Airbnb, VRBO, and Couchsurfing let you share your home with travelers looking for places to stay away from the typical hotel stay.

It sounds great on the surface, but homeowners (and renters who sublease through the services) come home to wrecked homes, squatters, and even police raids. Renters ran into their own scams and crimes, including murder.

Meanwhile, research in cities from New York to San Francisco report Airbnb raising rents, and SF’s government even sued the service.

Ride-sharing – Marketplaces like Uber and Lyft let you drive people around, while others like Zipcar and Turo let you rent your car to others.

These are great ways to monetize your car and spare time, and Uber/Lyft kickstarted the investment craze in P2P services. But Uber drivers filed a class-action lawsuit against Uber for misclassifying drivers as independent contractors to avoid proper compensation, and Uber drivers aren’t happy about pay either, according to their class actions.

Meanwhile, legacy transportation and taxi services, along with local governments, are grappling with these services in courts around the world.

P2P services – Marketplaces like Rover, Postmates, Bird, and Fiverr let you offer work services like dog walking, delivery, charging scooters, or any other chore or task for other people.

These marketplaces are great for connecting others to get a job done, but you get what you pay for these days, and often these services can feel more like Etsy when you’re looking for Neiman Marcus. People are also learning very quickly the returns don’t always add up to livable hourly wages.

And when one of these marketplaces blows up – like the e-scooter rental craze near every college campus fueled by Bird, Lime, and Razer – local governments immediately rush to ban them.

P2P marketplaces – Marketplaces like eBay, Craigslist, Letgo, and Facebook Marketplace let you sell goods (and often services) without the middleman of stores.

These marketplaces are great for making extra cash, and plenty of people built sustainable businesses on them. However, purchases can (and often do) go wrong, and the more you use them, the more likely you are to deal with flaky people, shady meetups, and substandard (sometimes knockoff or broken) products.

Using P2P marketplaces like this require trust, and some, like eBay, have those systems built-in, while others, like Craigslist, really don’t.

These disconnected pieces are what prompted the creation of Odyssey Coin.

The Proposed Odyssey Solution

Odyssey’s system is meant to function as the glue holding the entire shared economy together. Users would pay through the OCPay wallet and can track providers across a range of services. In doing so, they would be rewarded for giving reviews and other microtransactions on the network.

Meanwhile, providers would get the biggest boost from this service, because their credit would extend beyond the one platform.

If you build up your driver rating on Uber, for example, leaving for Lyft would be a bad idea because you have to start from the beginning. Of course, most drivers already know to drive for all the services at once, but what if you need to sell something on eBay or rent a room in your house when your car breaks down?

The reason eBay was one of the earliest success stories of the dotcom era is because of the ability to rate people. Ratings are important on Uber and Airbnb too. You want to know you’re staying with someone you can trust.

Building a trust economy requires trust in itself, and as discussed above, the Odyssey Foundation is struggling to maintain that trust among investors. It needs partnerships to survive, and it looks like much of the team is busy working on other projects related to Tron, Qtum, or elsewhere. Odyssey is a side project when it should be the crown jewel.

If the team can find a way to partner with any (or, more importantly, all) of the shared economy platforms above, it’ll be a big win. But that’s easier said than done, and they have a lot to prove about this platform.

Summary

Odyssey is a blockchain built specifically for the shared economy. These P2P marketplaces have existed as long as the internet, and they’re gaining huge investments even today. Shared economies are based on trust, and public trust in Odyssey will hinge on these key factors:

Odyssey is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses two ERC-20 cryptocurrencies – OCN and OCP. These tokens fuel network transactions and are used as a form of in-house payment.

Odyssey’s core team is heavily involved in Tron and Qtum, with interoperability a major focus of each project. However, Odyssey was built on Ethereum, not one of the partner blockchains.

Odyssey already has two supposedly working programs – a wallet/payment app for mobile called OCPay and a crypto exchange called OCNex.

With these pieces in place, Odyssey has the foundation built, but if they’re hoping for people to simply come, they’re dreaming. Enterprise partnerships and massive marketing dollars will be needed to make this a part of the technology lexicon. However, the project seems to be giving few signs of life lately.",2019-05-04 18:12:53+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

The US boasts 22 million crypto traders, nearly one-third of Bitcoin exchange users worldwide. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: The overwhelming majority of crypto traders come from the United States, according to surprising new research from DataLight.

The firm analyzed traders using the top 100 Bitcoin exchanges and found that over 22 million users hail from America. The next in line is Japan with 6 million, followed by South Korean’s 5 million users.

US Dominates Crypto Trading Industry

Collectively, it takes almost six other countries to reach the same number of traders as the US.

Notably, Korean exchanges like Bithumb report massive volume, but this volume is likely almost entirely fake. Several exchanges also engage in “transaction mining,” where users are rewarded for conducting trades, which means pumped-up volume.

DataLight’s report notes some interesting findings, including the impressive number of Turkish Bitcoin traders.

“Turkey for example, has in the last year seen wild fluctuations in the value of the Turkish Lira, as turbulent political conditions rock the country. Interestingly, on one day in August 2018, a 10% drop in the value of the Lira was accompanied by a marked spike in volumes on bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.”

CCN.com, incidentally, recently reported on problems that people are having with Turkish exchange Sistemkoin.

Turkey sports a population of nearly 80 million people, 2.4 million of whom trade. This is about 3% of their citizens, compared with 7% of the US population trading cryptos. Meanwhile, nearly 6% of all people in the UK trade cryptocurrency. These figures are quite high, but the report also doesn’t account for the frequency of trading. The data would be much more interesting if it were colored in light of how heavily each country trades.

‘Crypto Nation’ Hits 68 Million Citizens and Just Keeps Growing

The United States remains a regulatory nightmare for crypto traders, however, with several agencies claiming jurisdiction over the trade. Recently, FinCEN, a party rarely heard from in crypto anymore (we hear more from the SEC these days), fined a Bitcoin trader. Law enforcement agencies, the SEC, and CFTC – among others – also take part in regulating cryptocurrencies.

The situation is so confusing that the Token Taxonomy Act has been re-introduced with an eye toward simplifying the whole asset class. Under the proposed law, in-kind exchanges up to $600 would not be considered taxable income, and the SEC would lose jurisdiction over crypto tokens.

America’s largest exchange is Coinbase, which boasts more than 10 million of the 22 million overall users.

Several data points would be helpful to better analyze this research. As stated before, the frequency of trading would be useful. Additionally, we’d love to know the amount of trading, as well as how long these reported users have been trading. For example, how many new users were added during the 2017 bull run, and how many have since left?

According to DataLight, there are a total of around 68 million crypto traders across the world. This is more people than live in the United Kingdom.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes the number of crypto users in the future will outpace the number of Internet users today.

In a few years, there will be more users in #crypto than there are users for internet today. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 30, 2019

As the movement grows, one wonders what sort of political power such a population might wield down the line. As for today, it seems a few representatives and some outlandish presidential candidates are the best we can muster. But how long will it be until politicians are forced to court the crypto vote?",2019-05-05 20:00:44+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/banking-bitfinex-and-the-hidden-irony-of-cryptos-newest-controversy,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

When I visited some early bitcoin startups in Hong Kong five years ago, they were unanimous about their biggest challenge: finding a bank that would let them open an account.

It wasn’t that local banks were especially worried about this little-understood new industry. The issue was that compliance-obsessed correspondence banks in the U.S. were demanding that their counterparts in the territory apply an especially high “know-your-customer” standard for bitcoin businesses. Since Hong Kong banks couldn’t live without a dollar lifeline from New York, the path of least resistance was to say no.

That situation was a lesson about how the dollar’s reserve status leaves U.S. financial institutions, and the Washington regulators whose guidance they heed, exerting profound worldwide influence – in this case, constraining innovation, wherever it was happening.

Fast forward to 2019 and reports of a high-profile Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange’s troubles with a dubious Panamanian entity offer a stark reminder that little has changed.

The lack of access to reliable, mainstream credit and payment facilities, and the risky steps that cryptocurrency exchanges take to get around that problem, continue to be the sector’s Achilles Heel.

Yet despite the initial market jitters provoked by the NewYork Attorney General’s allegations that that exchange, Bitfinex, used funds from closely affiliated stablecoin provider Tether to mask an undisclosed $850 million shortfall, there may be light at the end of this multi-year tunnel.

To find it, you have to look at other developments in banking, blockchains and cryptocurrency.

There’s a case to be made that new crypto technologies and business models will foster a sufficient mix of greed and fear to drive banks into a more accommodating stance with crypto entities.

Bitfinex-Tether: a banking problem

For now, though, banking challenges remain rife for crypto firms. Bitfinex and Tether’s situation is proof of that.

Bitfinex’s integrity is understandably questioned by many. But it’s true that if it had been properly banked, the Hong Kong exchange would not have had to do business with payment processor Crypto Capital in the first place. (According to the NYAG’s report, Bitfinex was seeking to recover $850 million held by that Panamanian firm and in the meantime used Tether’s reserves to make the hole that that gap left in the exchange’s balance sheet.)

Moreover, if exchanges like Bitfinex had access to bank accounts for liquidity, Tether would never have become as integral to a large part of the bitcoin market’s clearing system as it did.

In 2015, shortly after it adopted its current name following its founding as Realcoin in 2014, Tether forged a close relationship with Bitfinex. The exchange opened trading in Tether’s USDT tokens, which the stablecoin provider promised could be redeemed one-for-one for dollars, and ultimately began using them to solve for liquidity needs that banks were not providing.

Then, as Bitfinex grew, creating counterparty relationships with multiple other exchanges, they, too, started using USDT for the same purpose. Rather than clearing customers trades’ through cumbersome banking system transactions that require deep institutional support, exchanges could freely manage their fiat-to-crypto float by moving in and out of a de facto crypto dollar.

After a while, however, this model came undone. It’s undoing also stemmed from the same root cause.

For Tether to consistently stand up the claim that one USDT token equaled one dollar, it had to convince investors that it held the equivalent in actual dollars in reserve at one or more banks. So, when doubts about Tether’s audits bled into concerns about its banking relationships, confidence dropped and the token lost its peg in the market. This, in turn, put pressure on Bitfinex and deepened its problems with Crypto Capital.

In summation, it’s fair to say that the bitcoin market’s persistent concern about a Bitfinex-Tether house of cards wouldn’t exist if banks had more readily serviced bitcoin exchanges.

The way out

If that were the full story, it would be hard to see how it ends. After all, in stoking additional uncertainty around liquidity and price volatility, this latest crisis only further diminishes bitcoin’s standing in the minds of regulators and bank compliance officers.

But there is a way out of this self-perpetuating trap. Such a solution arises from banks’ own need to find new sources of revenue in a post-crisis era in which their margins have been squeezed by low-interest rates, added risk constraints and heavy compliance requirements. Crypto-based products, if not cryptocurrencies themselves, could offer such an opportunity.

One opportunity lies with security tokens, which, once they mature and earn regulatory blessing, promise to give both fundraising enterprises and fund managers wider and more efficient access to capital and investments. They combine the comfort and compliance of a regulated instrument that’s attached to real-world assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate with the cost and efficiency of disintermediated issuance and smart-contract-automated cap table management, clearing, settlement, and trade reconciliation.

Security token offerings, or STOs, aren’t as subversive as ICOs. Initial coin offerings mostly didn’t represent any underlying real-world assets but rather promised the value of commodity-like “utility” within their blockchain-based network’s economic and incentive model. Crypto puritans also decry the fact that STOs rely on trusted third parties to stand up the underlying assets and exist only at the whim of government regulators.

But precisely because they could earn the blessing of regulators and the participation of traditional enterprises, STOs are attracting attention on Wall Street. The recent news that Societe Generale tested an STO based on the public Ethereum blockchain has taken that interest to a new level.

STOs might make some of investment banks’ back-office functions redundant, but fees for STO market-making, risk-management and underwriting could more than offset that, at least for a while.

The missing piece

But to get to the ideal STO state, another piece of the puzzle is needed: a payment token.

That’s why I see banks increasingly offering services and support for the emerging new breed of sophisticated, reserve-backed stablecoins. Those offered by Gemini, Paxos and the consortium formed by Circle and Coinbase already have much deeper, well-regulated banking relationships than anything Tether could claim. (I see banks preferring these stablecoins over JP Morgan’s JPM coin. Why reward a competing bank’s technology?)

Here’s the thing, though. As a more deeply banked stablecoin ecosystem emerges it will also provide stability to the market for blockchain-native cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Exchanges will have a more reliable, digital source of fiat liquidity.

Eventually, they won’t even need to hold client’s fiat deposits, putting an end to disasters such as QuadrigaCX. All of that will help the maturation of cryptocurrencies generally, enabling their wider adoption as alternatives and competitors to the fiat system.

This brings us to a somewhat ironic conclusion for crypto true believers who pine for an end to the centralized banking system and a digital store of non-fiat value: the road to utopia may be paved in deals with bankers and government regulators.

Québec, the resource-rich Canadian province, has made up its mind about cryptocurrency mining. Régie de l’énergie, the region’s energy regulator, has rendered its decision on the blockchain sector and lifted the moratorium on electricity supplies. An additional 300 MW of energy will be allocated to power the minting of digital coins, a move that local officials hope will make Québec one of the major forces in the industry.

Applying Miners Need to Meet a Set of Selection Criteria

After a period of restrictions and policy making, regulators in the French-speaking region have realized the potential benefit of hosting crypto mining companies. From a declared inability to meet the high energy demands of the sector, through a proposal to charge up to three times higher electricity rates, to the political statement that “we’re not really interested,” in 2018 Québec didn’t seem ready to embrace and accommodate the energy-intensive bitcoin mining. However, things have changed.

The board responsible for energy regulation in the province has lifted last year’s moratorium. According to a press release, the local public utility managing the generation and distribution of electricity, Hydro-Québec, is happy with the positive development. Régie de l’énergie attempts to not only raise the status of the region as a mining-friendly destination offering cheap electrical power but also to make sure Québec and its people benefit as much as possible from this cooperation.

The regulator’s decision envisages the classification of blockchain companies as a separate category of consumers. A 300 MW block will be dedicated to the industry, of which at least 50 MW will be reserved for small projects of 5 MW or less. A new selection process is being put in place to allocate the quota. It introduces several economic development criteria – number of direct jobs in Québec per MW: 30%, total payroll of direct jobs per MW: 30%, investment in Québec per MW: 30%, as well as an environmental condition – 10% of the used energy should come from heat recovery.

Authorities also reserve the right to limit supplies for mining facilities during peak periods, up to 300 hours each winter. The rates that will be charged for the spent electricity will be determined according to the existing tariff. That means that depending on their consumption profile, mining companies will fall under one of the following categories: LG, which is the general rate for large‑power customers, or M, the rate for medium‑power consumers.

Survey Shows 4,500 MW of Confirmed Demand From Mining Businesses

To find out what’s next for crypto miners in Québec, news.Bitcoin.com turned to David Vincent, director of business development at Hydro-Québec, one of the largest hydropower producers in the world. We asked him whether he thinks Régie de l’énergie’s decision is timely, given that the tide in the crypto sector seems to be turning, after a prolonged bear market which affected mining and lowered its profitability.

“You could say it’s good timing, considering that the market seems to be going up again. However, even last year after cryptocurrencies had dropped in price significantly, a survey we did with some of the serious players who had contacted us confirmed that there was still a lot of interest for our electricity,” the official noted. He emphasized that the vast majority of companies contacted were still interested, with more than 4,500 MW of confirmed demand from the respondents.

“Also, even during a bear market situation, Québec is in a good position to attract projects from this industry as low rates become even more important to stay profitable. Our rates give us a competitive advantage. With all of that in mind, we expect a lot of interest in the selection process for our new block of 300 MW for this industry,” Vincent commented.

The Hydro-Québec executive further explained that the new quota approved by the regulator is being added to the 368 MW previously allocated to blockchain projects that are either already in operation or have been approved. “In the end, we will have a total of 668 MW reserved for blockchain mining, which will make this industry one of the biggest industries in Québec in terms of power consumption, basically overnight. This is no small feat for an industry that was almost non-existent here about two years ago,” David Vincent said. He believes that looking at the world market, the allocation of 668 MW for the blockchain sector will actually make Québec one of the major forces in this industry:

We feel that this is a block that is big enough to let this industry grow in Québec, while still leaving room for the development of other industries, like data centers, greenhouses, mines, etc. The idea was to strike a balanced approach. We feel that this block is a good start for this nascent industry and it will allow us to get a better mutual understanding.

Prior to the announcement of Régie de l’énergie’s latest position, there had been media speculation that the attitude towards the industry in Québec was evolving due to the political change in the province’s government. It’s been reported that François Legault, the leader of Coalition Avenir Québec, which won the general election in the French Canadian province last fall, intends to fulfil Hydro-Québec’s potential and make the utility more profitable.

However, Vincent believes that the regulator’s decision has nothing to do with politics. “The Energy Board is an economic regulation agency that is independent of the government and stays clear of political influence,” he noted. “Anyone who has followed the hearings at the Energy Board closely will tell you that the decision seems to be in line with the concerns voiced by those who participated in the public hearings.”

Hydro-Québec’s representative added that with the high demand for the company’s product, it makes sense that the utility can select those companies that will bring the most value to the province. “The economic development criteria in the decision match what we had proposed to the Energy Board. Our advice for companies who want a part of the energy block would be to be well prepared to demonstrate how much value they can bring to Québec in terms of job creation, salaries and investments per MW used,” he stressed.

“Those who go further than just mining will certainly score better in the selection process as they tend to invest more and create more jobs. Also, those who re-use the heat created by their activities instead of just wasting it will get a few more points in the evaluation of their projects, so this could give them an edge over competitors with similar projects,” David Vincent explained.

Shaun Chong, head of Bitcoin.com’s mining operations, acknowledged that the new opportunities for cryptocurrency mining in the Canadian province of Québec represent a positive development for the whole sector in general. However, he also noted that the mining market conditions are tough right now. “So those regulatory requirements could make it hard to make a profit,” remarked Chong, who is responsible for the Bitcoin.com Pool.

Over the last few years, many have claimed that bitcoin core (BTC) has turned into, or will soon become, a store of value (SoV). Proponents of the BTC-based SoV theory seem to think that money can somehow store value and if it’s held long enough, the price will be higher or predictably useful when spent at a later date. This is an economic fallacy however because money cannot store value and, as innovative as bitcoin is, it will never be immune to market influences.

Menger Stomps the SoV Fallacy

There are a ton of people who believe that BTC is a store of value and that if they keep hodling someday they might be super wealthy and protected from the world’s turbulent economy. Except this couldn’t be further from the truth. BTC is not an SoV currently, and never will be due to the fact that money itself cannot be an SoV. The idea that money cannot serve as a store of value has been written about by many economists over the years including Carl Menger, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises. Carl Menger (1840-1921) was the founder of the Austrian school of economics proper. Menger was one of the first economists to explain in detail about the relationship of value and money to market prices. Menger writes in Principles of Economics:

Value is … nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, but merely the importance that we first attribute to the satisfaction of our needs … and in consequence carry over to economic goods as the … causes of the satisfaction of our needs.

Claim and Ownership

A good way to understand that money is not a store of value is by picturing a television set worth the spot price of 1 BTC ($5,700 at press time). Now if someone was to smash the TV screen into a thousand pieces with a sledgehammer then no one would be able to watch the device’s picture. After that, nobody could watch a television show on that set as the sledgehammer quite literally destroyed the screen’s practicality and basic utility. Now let’s say instead the person decided to purposefully lose the BTC. They create a wallet on an external hard drive without backing up the data and destroy it by burying it in a landfill. By essentially making the BTC near impossible to retrieve it doesn’t mean value was destroyed. It means the person had destroyed their claim to 1 BTC’s current utility. Fiat money, gold bullion, and bitcoins are not SoVs as they are merely a claim to ownership.

For centuries many individuals have believed money can store value and this fallacy has found its way into the cryptocurrency community. In 2014, the author and economist Joseph Salerno gave Mises readers a great insight into why people think that money can somehow store value. “According to mainstream economics textbooks, one of the primary functions of money is to measure the value of goods and services exchanged on the market,” Salerno details. The economist refutes this common mistake and adds:

“The value an individual attaches to a given sum of money or to any kind of good is based on subjective judgment and is without physical dimensions. As such the value of money varies from moment to moment and between different individuals.” He refutes this common mistake, asserting:

The price paid for a good in a concrete act of exchange does not measure the good’s value; rather it expresses the fact that the buyer and the seller value the money and the price paid in inverse order. For this reason, neither money nor any other good can ever serve as a measure of value.

‘Alleged Store of Value in Contrast to a Medium of Exchange Is Imprecise and Impressionistic’

One economist who has both studied and written a great deal about bitcoin and monetary theory, in particular, is Konrad S. Graf. The author has produced a wide array of definitive pieces including On the Origins of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Decrypted Series, and Action-Based Jurisprudence. During an interview in October 2017, Graf touched upon the challenging subject of trying to use theoretical concepts to help define bitcoin. The economist said that there’s often a “tendency to pretend to force bitcoin into some existing box into which it does not actually fit.” Graf explained there are few monetary categories discussed when it comes to bitcoin and he believes these variables are on a continuum and that “none are exclusive.”

“The variables under discussion are therefore the relative amounts held, the duration of holding, and the increments of future spending of the medium of exchange,” Graf’s interview details. “In contrast, the idea of an alleged “store of value” use often used in this debate as if it were a contrast to a medium of exchange use is imprecise and impressionistic.” Additionally, Graf noted:

Just as money does not “measure” value, as Mises emphasized, but is rather exchanged for goods at some indefinite future time, “value” cannot be “stored,” as if it were a certain amount of food. This “store of value” idea is more a weak intuitive analogy than a rigorous economic concept. Underneath this illusion, there are only intertemporal exchanges that take place over different time scales and in different amounts.

Usefulness, Practicality, and Real-World Purchasing Power Is a Far More Meaningful Form of Money

The need for practicality and utility is a very important aspect of money and BTC is not the only cryptocurrency that offers censorship resistance. If a certain portion of the world cannot use BTC because of high fees then it’s not really censorship resistant at all. If someone holds $50 worth of BTC and the network fee per transaction is $40, is the money practical and is it useful? It’s hard to imagine an alleged store of value holding steady and stable and not being useful all the time. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency with real-world utility that also offers censorship resistance will likely surpass any coin that acts as a pyramid scheme. Cryptocurrencies offer interesting possibilities with private keys and code that have rules in regard to what a digital claim looks like. And underneath it all, cryptos are just numbers that help us make exchanges at different times in a permissionless fashion but they can never store value no matter how many times we repeat the erroneous statement.

In fact, lots of people misconstrue BTC as an SoV by accident, but unfortunately there are many seasoned sophists teaching people this unsound philosophy purposefully every day. Maybe people should ask why bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is better money than its fiat predecessors, instead of concentrating energy on useless catchphrases like ‘hodl.’ Rather than asking whether or not these digital assets are SOVs, people should be asking whether they have real-world utility and purchasing power.

Why do you think people make the mistake in believing that BTC is or someday can be an SoV? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

This, according to recent report from Bloxlive.tv, which revealed that visitors will be able to exchange fiat currencies for digital currencies “upon arrival.”

“Revolutionizing Economies With Crypto”

Alternatively, tourists visiting Malacca City will be able to use their own “virtual funds.” However, all cryptocurrencies “must be traded into the city’s virtual asset” which is referred to as the “DMI Coin.” According to the report, tourists have the option of using various applications to pay for goods and services within Malacca City.

Interestingly, the Chinese government is reportedly backing the development of the town, in order to “make it a blockchain tourist capital.” Currently, it seems that Malacca City’s crypto project is in its initial stages of development.

It may be considered just a proof of concept (PoC) at this point which involves experimenting with “crypto as a workable monetary system or it could be a decentralized tourism gimmick [and only] time will tell,” Bloxlive.tv noted.

The Middle Eastern city of Dubai, which is considered to be United Arab Emirates’ business hub, has also been planning to adopt crypto and distributed ledger technology (DLT) on a large scale.

As confirmed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (at that time), the vice president and prime minister of the UAE, Dubai’s wide-scale adoption of blockchain tech is part of its ongoing technological modernization project called “Smart Dubai.”",,https://cryptobriefing.com/beam-grin-nimble-mimblewimble/,"Share this article

Grin and Beam are both open-source implementations of MimbleWimble, a protocol that offers enhanced privacy and high speeds. Although both launched in January 2019, the projects operate with vastly different goals and operations.

On the surface, Grin and Beam are quite similar: both coins have no addresses and data storage is minimal, making the blockchains extremely light-weight, scalable and fast. Neither had a pre-mine or ICO, which many investors consider to be red flags. They both conducted fair proof-of-work launches, with the philosophy that a currency must be confidential to become widespread.

Grin’s market capitalization is currently more than double that of Beam, but that doesn’t make it a more successful project. Both projects have subtle nuances in technology and governance that could provide formidable advantages down the line.

Grin has been under active development since 2016, thanks solely to community donations and volunteers. On the other side, Beam came into the industry in March 2018 after raising $5M in venture capital funds. Grin has a community developed ethos that cherishes the fact that their project was founded anonymously (just like Bitcoin). Beam prefers to take more of a traditional start-up approach with team-focused development.

Grin’s development goals and targets are set during bi-weekly developer and community calls, in which anyone can join and add items to the agenda. This has garnered the attention of many Bitcoin maximalists, noting the similiarities with BTC’s early days. Grin development focuses more on providing the greater community with the developer tools to build the products that they want.

Beaming Forward

While Grin development continues to be volunteer-led, Beam has plans to set up a Foundation which takes 20% of each block reward to fund future development, marketing and strategies. This is a similar model to ZCash.

Being structured as a traditional start-up allows Beam to ship code and make decisions faster, hire employees, and bring on a dedicated sales and marketing team that is focused on Beam adoption. This team attends conferences and builds relationships with merchants to develop things like Beam-specific payment processors. At this point, Beam has delivered more community-oriented product suites, such as a user-friendly wallet, while Grin still relies on a command-line wallet.

Which coin is better?

This is a difficult question to answer, but we can compare the two coins in a few salient categories:

Funding Model: This is a toss up, because on one hand Beam’s Foundation model and VC raise ensure future funding to support a large team. At present, their team team has more than 20 paid professionals. At the same time – Grin’s community focused funding model has onlookers feeling nostalgia thinking back on the early days of Bitcoin. We’ll chalk this one up as a tie.

Ethos: This is a start-up model (Beam) vs. community-driven (Grin) model here. We’’ll have to give the edge to the Grin’s model, since most of the crypto community tends to side with the “anti-establishment” folks.

Usability: Beam currently has desktop wallets for every platform you can think of, while Grin is just starting to ship wallets that offer something other than command-line code. Beam has a clear advantage.

Speed-to-Market: Beam started developing their project more than 2 years after Grin, and they launched several weeks earlier… with many more user-friendly tools. The start-up model is a clear winner for being much quicker.

Decentralization: Grin displaces decision-making among anyone and everyone that wants to be involved. There is no loyalty to investors or advisors, and the project seems to have no single point of failure, especially since the founder is anonymous. Advantage Grin.

Governance: This is a tricky topic in crypto. On one hand, Beam has an incredibly talented team in which each member is likely qualified to give their two cents in a governance conversation. On the other side, anyone can partake with Grin, which makes it closer to what crypto-traditionalists want to see. This one is a close tie.

Mining: Beam uses a memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm called Equihash, which has had vulnerability issues with Bitcoin Gold and ZenCash. Grin uses a blended algorithm based off of the Cuckatoo Cycle, which uses two algorithms: one is ASIC-resistant, and the other is ASIC-friendly. Advantage Grin.

Innovation: Beam has a more comprehensive roadmap and they’re delving into things like atomic swaps and integrating Lightning. Grin focuses on slow needs-based development. Beam wins here.

This isn’t the most rigorous way to evaluate two cryptocurrency projects, but it should offer an informative introduction to those who are unfamiliar with the two MimbleWimble tokens.

Both projects are competing to offer the best privacy-by-default payment cryptocurrency, but this competition is good-natured, and they seem to act as though they’re on the same team. Beam actually partially funded a code audit for Grin before it launched, citing that audits done on MimbleWimble were important for both projects.

For now it seems like the competition between Grin and Beam can be boiled down to their operating models; one company operates as a start-up and the other as a community. Choosing a winner on these grounds is a subjective exercise, and unlikely to be conclusive.

Despite the hype surrounding each of their launches, the coins are both down more than 10% in their price in the last quarter while the industry has been on the rise. Given that neither project has yet demonstrated a clear advantage, we might have to wait for a rematch.",2019-05-05 17:47:05+00:00,,,,,,,,,

“I actually think we should shut down the cryptocurrencies,” Stiglitz declared in the video, pointing out his opinion of the major deficiencies of the digital currencies like bitcoin (BTC).

According to Stiglitz, crypto is not the right way to create a more efficient global economy due to a lack of transparency. Indeed, he emphasized that cryptocurrencies accompany illegal financial activities such as money laundering by moving money off “from a transparent platform into a dark platform.”

Stiglitz argued that “there is no need for anybody to go to a cryptocurrency,” claiming that such a currency does not have any of the attributes of what he calls a good currency, while the United States dollar does have all those attributes.

However, the world-known economist still expressed confidence in an electronic payments mechanism that would represent a transparent financial system. According to Stiglitz, real time data about what people are spending would bring about both a better regulated economy and macroeconomic management.

Stiglitz had previously made a similar statement about crypto in 2017, claiming that bitcoin should be banned since it does not serve any socially useful function and only poses major risks to investors due to its high volatility.

Recently, Cointelegraph reported that the Indian government is considering a complete ban of cryptocurrencies, and has allegedly launched new inter-ministerial consultations on a draft bill to do so.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/single-address-behind-more-than-50-of-bitcoin-cash-transactions-report,"A single address has been responsible for more than half of the bitcoin cash (BCH) transactions in the past month, according to a tweet by @IamNomad on May 5.

According to the Bitcoin Cash Block Explorer, the mystery account has made more than 587,000 transactions since it became operational on April 8 of this year.

Many of the transactions are for fractional amounts of BCH and they are made with regularity, with three to four new transactions emerging per second.

Overall, the address has received $22,763.06 (80.981 BCH) at press time and has sent $21,546 (76.654 BCH), leaving it with a balance of $1,216.36 (4.327 BCH).

Over this period of the account’s creation to press time, the whole bitcoin cash blockchain has processed 1.17 million transactions — about half coming from the aforementioned wallet. The frequency of transactions could suggest that someone is attempting to drive up the number of transactions to make the network look a lot busier than it actually is, as one commentator responded.

Another theory is that the miniscule transactions are being performed as a test, potentially for a game, with developers taking advantage of BCH’s low fees.

Bitcoin cash was one of the top five performing cryptocurrencies of the past week, according to a Cointelegraph analysis.

A hard fork of the altcoin is scheduled for May 15, with a scaling and privacy code change being enforced to improve its privacy and scalability.

The CFTC is willing to let an ether futures contract go to market after soliciting market feedback last year

A futures contract might bring in fresh institutional funding to the crypto space

This, in turn, might reassure retail traders looking at the cryptocurrency

Futures might also cement the CFTC’s jurisdiction over ether, which at present is limited to enforcement actions

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is willing to approve an ether futures contract – provided it ticks all the right boxes, a senior official has told CoinDesk.

The CFTC, which oversees derivatives markets in the U.S., has already allowed bitcoin futures markets to launch, with both CME Group and Cboe Global Exchange offering cash-settled contracts at the end of 2017. Now, the regulator is willing to oversee a similar product for ether, currently the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, said the official.

“I think we can get comfortable with an ether derivative being under our jurisdiction,” said the person, who did not want to be identified because the regulator does not typically publicize decisions to adopt new products.

“We don’t do bold pronouncements, what we do is we look at applications before us,” the official said, explaining:

“A derivatives exchange comes to us and says ‘we want to launch this particular product.’ … If they came to us with a particular derivative that met our requirements, I think that there’s a good chance that it would be [allowed to be] self-certified by us.”

However, the CFTC would only respond to a specific application put before the regulator, rather than volunteer an opinion, the individual said.

If proposed and approved, a regulated futures product would open up the ether market to broad institutional investment.

“Many funds have mandates that do not allow them to buy the digital currency underlying,” said John Todaro, director of digital currency research at financial software provider Tradeblock. Further, a cash-settled futures contract, paid out in fiat rather than the underlying crypto, would allow hedge funds and the like “to gain exposure to ether without worrying about custody (which has been a bottleneck to institutional investment),” he said.

In the long run, Todaro added, a CFTC-supervised futures market “could usher in confidence among regulators such as the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] which could pave the way for an ETF,” an exchange-traded fund bringing additional liquidity to ether.

An increase in institutional investment would, in turn, bolster retail investors’ confidence in ether, Todaro said.

CME and Cboe’s bitcoin futures, when they first launched, saw an immediate positive response, with enough traders trying to purchase Cboe’s contracts that the firm’s website crashed. The introduction of these futures contracts may also have contributed to bitcoin’s price skyrocketing to its all-time high of nearly $20,000.

To be sure, some have argued that futures may also have hurt bitcoin’s price, though Todaro said that it is more likely that bitcoin’s price had already reached its peak and the approval of futures just happened to coincide with that time.

Learning process

The CFTC first indicated it was looking at ethereum in December when the regulator published a “Request for Input” (RFI) asking a number of questions about the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, the market around it and the underlying technology.

These questions ranged from asking about proof-of-stake (the consensus mechanism that ethereum is expected to eventually adopt to replace bitcoin-style mining) to how ether deposits may be audited.

The agency explicitly asked what impact the introduction of derivatives contracts might have on the cryptocurrency.

George Pullen, a senior economist with the CFTC Division of Market Oversight, told CoinDesk at the end of March that the RFI sought industry and market input on the risks, mechanics and use cases for ether.

In particular, the CFTC was looking to contrast ether with bitcoin, he said, explaining:

“After our initial public white papers, primers, on virtual currencies, bitcoin, and smart contracts it was clear that a one-size fits all approach to crypto was not appropriate and we needed to know more.”

The CFTC’s RFI will help the regulator to understand “the range of issues that might exist” around the ether space, as well as develop better relationships with the crypto community at large, he added.

“It’s critically important for us to engage in outreach to understand the variety in technologies, markets, and the differences in the community; if we’re just listening to our own voices inside the building, the loudest voices in business, or just the voices in D.C. we could miss out on the bigger picture,” Pullen explained at the time.

A total of 35 comments were submitted to the CFTC’s RFI by trade associations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce, think tank Coin Center, startups Blockchains LLC and Circle, exchanges like Coinbase and self-proclaimed bitcoin creator Craig Wright, among others.

The CFTC, or at least its Chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, is already pretty popular within the community, which has dubbed him “Crypto Dad” after he called for light-touch regulation around the space.

Power grab?

In addition to giving investors access to a new derivatives product, approving an ether futures contract may cement the CFTC’s regulatory authority over the underlying spot market.

Notably, ErisX, a digital assets and futures trading platform (which wants to offer bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ethereum futures when its derivatives clearing organization license is approved), believes that regulating a futures contract on ethereum would grant the CFTC some additional oversight on the ethereum spot market.

Thomas Chippas, the exchange’s CEO, wrote in his response to the RFI that a futures contract that “includes a settlement price set by a physically settled cash market” in the U.S. may improve the CFTC’s “ability to properly oversee or monitor the cash market for fraud and manipulation.” ErisX declined to comment for this article.

The CFTC likely already has some jurisdiction over the ether cash market, several lawyers CoinDesk spoke to said. However, this authority is limited.

Anne Termine, who leads the futures and derivatives practice group at Covington & Burling LLP and was previously a chief trial attorney with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk that the regulator has already clearly said cryptocurrencies are commodities.

“As such, the CFTC has limited regulatory oversight over cryptocurrency spot markets, namely the ability to take enforcement action whenever there is fraud or manipulation in these spot markets,” Termine said.

Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer with the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group, noted that the regulator has “after-the-fact” enforcement jurisdiction over crypto spot markets in terms of fraud or manipulation, but no jurisdiction over exchanges simply conducting spot transactions.

Moreover, anything that is not a security is usually broadly defined as a commodity, she said.

The question of whether ether is a security has not been officially resolved, but officials at the SEC seem to believe it isn’t. William Hinman, the agency’s director of corporation finance, said at a conference in 2018 that he does not see ether as a security.

His comments were seemingly affirmed by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in March, who wrote that he agreed with Hinman’s analysis of when a crypto asset might not be a security, though he did not specifically name ethereum.

Introducing a “futures contract would implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction beyond anti-fraud and manipulation provisions,” Termine explained. The contract would have to trade on a CFTC-regulated futures exchange, meaning it would be subject to the regulator’s direct oversight.

Termine concluded:

“The implications for the broader community would be enhanced CFTC oversight over [ether] but potentially a legitimization of the cryptocurrency.”

Now, when checking BTC/USD data on CoinMarketCap, it shows a single asterisk mark for Bitfinex’s price, with the message at the bottom “Price excluded.”

Notably, at time of writing, bitcoin is trading at a premium of over $300 on Bitfinex as compared to other major exchanges. For instance, on Coinbase and Gemini, the price is around $5,650, while on Bitfinex it is around $5,985.

In its methodology description on its website, CoinMarketCap states the conditions for such exclusions saying:

“The price of any cryptocurrency is a volume weighted average of market pair prices (1) for the cryptocurrency. … Some prices are manually excluded from the average, denoted by an asterisk (*) on the markets tab if the price does not seem indicative of a free market price; for example, when an exchange disables withdrawals or deposits, or regulatory conditions make it impossible for anyone else outside of a certain geographical region to buy coins. Some prices are also automatically excluded when our algorithms detect that the reported price is a significant outlier when compared to other market pairs for the same cryptocurrency, denoted by three asterisks (***) on the markets tab.”

The exclusion from CoinMarketCap’s calculations comes as Bitfinex continues to be mired in controversy. Late last month, the New York attorney general alleged that the exchange, which shares management and owners with stablecoin issuer Tether, lost $850 million of corporate and client funds and subsequently used a loan from Tether’s reserves to secretly cover the shortfall.

Bitfinex later claimed that the funds had been “seized” by various authorities and that it was working to retrieve the funds.

Bitfinex has now launched what’s termed an initial exchange offering (IEO) to raise as much as $1 billion through a token sale. Though an official white paper for the offering is not yet out, Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao has already started taking pre-orders from users who want to participate in the sale.

Last January, Bitfinex and Tether were subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, although the regulator did not publicly state why.

CoinMarketCap previously changed the way it used data from Bitfinex in response to a report by CoinDesk that pointed out that a trading pair shown on CoinMarketCap – apparently for trades between the tether stablecoin (USDT) and U.S. dollars – did not, in fact, represent a pair available for trading on Bitfinex. In response, CoinMarketCap said it was excluding that pair from its volume data.

The data provider also formed a new alliance last week, called the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), with Bitfinex and other exchanges on board, in order to tackle concerns over cryptocurrency data reporting.

PSA: a lot of people believe there are about 10,000 Bitcoin nodes. This is incorrect, this number is the amount of *listening* nodes. The total number of Bitcoin full nodes now exceeds 100,000. pic.twitter.com/VYziaKCYzg — Francis Pouliot 🐂 (@francispouliot_) May 5, 2019

Indeed, it is often reported that Bitcoin has somewhere around 9,000 to 10,000 full nodes validating its blockchain (Hard Fork has done this, too!).

According to prominent Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, that number is closer to 100,000 – and he says it’s because other node monitoring services typically include only one type of node (“listening nodes”).

Whether nodes are “listening” isn’t all that important

The security of the Bitcoin network can be gauged by the number of nodes that keep a complete copy of its blockchain.

These are referred to as “fully-validating nodes,” or “full nodes” for short. Bitcoin miners broadcast messages (transactions) across the network for validation using these full nodes.

A higher number of nodes increases the overall security of Bitcoin by making double-spending more difficult for malicious miners.

Dashjr previously told Hard Fork that popular sites like Coindance only show Bitcoin‘s “listening nodes,” but whether a node is “listening” is a mostly-irrelevant technical detail.

Listening nodes are essentially the same as full nodes, but publicly visible.

Courtesy of Luke Dashjr

“Economic nodes – those handling transactions – can be both listening and not,” said Dashjr. “Frankly, looking at just listening nodes isn’t a very useful metric – non-listening nodes are just as relevant.”

Dashjr said that in a sense, “listening nodes” are much like “open ports,” which ultimately makes them easier to track. He also expressed his chart updates hourly, and is based on four weeks of data to ensure it includes nodes that aren’t constantly online.

“I’m not sure why these sites continue to give meaningless information, and don’t use better algorithms to present a more accurate view of the network,” added Dashjr.

Old Bitcoin vulnerabilities are still hanging around

One concerning statistic is that over half of the Bitcoin network is running out-of-date versions of the Bitcoin Core software.

In particular, almost 58 percent of Bitcoin nodes are vulnerable to exploit CVE-2018-17144, which allows malicious miners to crash the Bitcoin network with a costly denial-of-service attack.

Bitcoin Core devs later disclosed the exploit also allows bad actors to potentially inflate Bitcoin‘s supply past its 21-million limit.

At the time, the network was urged to update software as soon as possible to keep the blockchain robust, so this should be considered a reminder.

To help you get started, we’ve outlined the different fees below.

What does maker mean?

There are two main methods to placing an order on a crypto trading platform. To become a market maker, you are adding liquidity to an order book by requesting to buy or sell the asset at a certain price, to which there is currently nobody willing to offer to match your request.







The above image shows an order book on crypto trading site Coinbase Pro. The price on the right hand side (in green and red) is the price at which users of the site are attempting to become a maker in the market (buyers in green, sellers in red). If a user wanted to buy Bitcoin at a price of £3926.99, they could place an order at that price. However, as nobody currently exists to sell at that price, the order would sit unmatched on the order book as pictured above. If another user did eventually agree to sell their Bitcoin at the price asked, the trade (their Bitcoin for GBP) would then take place.

At that point, they would be charged a maker fee. This is usually a small percentage of the fiat amount traded (e.g. 0.1%).

What does taker mean?

A market taker is a user of the order book who wants to buy or sell an asset (e.g. Bitcoin) at whatever the going market rate is (i.e. they’ll take the going price).

Using the order book example above, somebody wanting to buy 0.5 Bitcoin could do so for £3927.00 as a user (or various users) are willing to sell their Bitcoin to him for that price. Conversely, if a user wanted to sell their Bitcoin, they could do so for £3926.99 as a user (or various) are willing to buy from them at that price. They would then be charged a taker fee, which usually reflects the extra convenience afforded so is higher than a maker fee (a typical amount in crypto is 0.3%).

Why is this important for traders?

Whilst 0.1% may not make up much of a person’s crypto balance, these small fees can add up to a lot in the long run. Especially for high frequency traders. Therefore, professional crypto traders pay close attention to the fees charged at different exchanges. It is also important to factor in these costs when planning your future trades.

Of course it could save traders money in the long run by switching to an exchange with lower fees, but this benefit should be weighed up against other factors, such as how reputable the exchange is, how reliable it is, and potentially the user experience and other factors.",2019-05-06 10:00:10+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-trade-cryptocurrency-120025450.html,"There are a few different ways to make money through cryptocurrency.

There are a few different ways to make money through cryptocurrency. One option is to buy and hodl for the long term in the hopes that you have picked a gem. Another option is that you can consistently trade the highs and lows in price. Neither are guaranteed to make you money and trading consistently requires a higher level of skill and a larger amount of time. Below, we help inform your decision to buy or trade cryptocurrency.

Buying and hodling

Buying and hodling is what many people throughout the years have chosen to do with cryptocurrencies. Sometimes they have become bagholders after buying at the top of a price range and become unwilling to sell as they don’t want to admit defeat.

In some instances, however, hodling can lead to better fortunes. For example, had you bought Litecoin in its first bull run the following years would have seen you achieving a loss. Yet if you hodled your way through to the bull run of 2017 you would have gone from a terrible loss to a potentially great profit, so long as you sold.

So clearly, there can be benefits to buying and simply hodling your cryptocurrency for the future. However, picking the right crypto isn’t so simple. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies nowadays and there is a strong likelihood that many are not very useful or will quickly fall out of favour.

Despite possible benefits, there are also risks that are unavoidable. Buying any cryptocurrency comes with risk and there are never any guarantees in such a volatile market.

One way to view cryptocurrencies is not as an investment at all, but as an act of rebellion. A rebellion against the power of the State and the current economic system. In doing, so the price of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency can become irrelevant. One Bitcoin is simply worth one Bitcoin.

Should you trade cryptocurrency instead?

Trading cryptocurrency sounds easy in theory. Buy low, sell high. Simple right? Unfortunately, if it was that easy everyone that was doing it would be rich. Whilst it may appear this way (especially on social media) with the numerous influencers in both Forex and cryptocurrency markets showing off their wealth, it isn’t.

Story continues

Cryptocurrencies can be particularly hard to trade due to their volatility. There’s also a lack of regulation in cryptocurrency markets, meaning that market manipulation such as pump and dump schemes can easily happen.

To trade cryptocurrency, you need to have the know-how of the market as well as the skills to be able to become profitable. These are not skills that you pick up overnight and can take years of practice.

Trading cryptocurrencies also comes with the added risk that you are more likely to lose your money. This is because you’re trading on a consistent basis. thereby increasing your risk to the market. Whilst technical analysis may help in giving signs of how the market will perform, there are no guarantees that it will always be true. If your skills of technical analysis aren’t up to scratch, then you are likely to have a challenging time.

When trading cryptocurrencies, anyone can look like a genius in a bull market. However, a bear market can be a cruel mistress and this is where your skills will truly be tested. Until you have survived a bear market and traded through it then you will not know whether your skills are up to the test.

Trading cryptocurrencies is not for the feint hearted.

Conclusion

There is no right or wrong answer as to whether you should buy or trade cryptocurrency. It can depend on your situation, the time you have available, your knowledge and your skill level. Becoming a trader, at least a profitable trader, is no easy feat.

Buying and hodling cryptocurrencies is certainly much easier and less time consuming. However, mistakes can also be made through this, especially if you have a penchant for picking the worst coins on the market. Remember, even coins such as Bitconnect had a strong community of people telling you to buy it. Research is the key here and so be sure to listen to a variety of sources.

Another key tip is to keep your emotions at bay in both scenarios. Emotions can be fickle things so try to ensure rationality, regardless of whether you buy or trade cryptocurrency.

Whichever decision you choose to make, do not rush into it and make sure you consider the risks. As always never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin’s price dropped by as much as 4.2 percent in early Asian trading as news of the hack broke, although it later recovered some of its losses.

Zhao said on Twitter other crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, had blocked deposits from addresses linked to the hack.

Last year, $950 million of cryptocurrencies was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges and infrastructure services such as wallets, up nearly 260 percent from the previous year, research from U.S.-based cyber security firm CiptherTrace showed.

Exchanges in Japan and South Korea accounted for 58 percent of the thefts last year, the research found.

Zhao’s post on the Binance website said that all deposits and withdrawals from the exchange would remain suspended while the company conducted a thorough security review, which, it estimated, would take a week.",2019-05-08 05:21:59+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/binance-bitcoin-hack-over-40-million-of-cryptocurrency-stolen.html,"Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, speaks during a TV interview in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018.

Hackers have stolen over $40 million worth of bitcoin from Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, the company said on Tuesday. Binance said the hackers ran off with over 7,000 bitcoin and used a variety of attack methods to carry out the ""large scale security breach"" which occurred on Tuesday.

They also managed to get some user information such as two-factor authentication codes, which are required to log in to a Binance account. The cryptocurrency exchange was able to trace the stolen bitcoin to a single wallet, it said. ""The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,"" Binance said in a statement. ""The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed. Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system. We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that.""",2019-05-08,https://www.coindesk.com/hackers-steal-40-7-million-in-bitcoin-from-crypto-exchange-binance,"Hackers stole more than 7,000 bitcoin from crypto exchange Binance, the world’s largest by volume, the startup reported Tuesday.

Binance announced that a “large scale security breach” was discovered earlier on May 7, finding that malicious actors were able to access user API keys, two-factor authentication codes and “potentially other info,” the exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said in a letter. As a result, they were able to withdraw roughly $41 million in bitcoin from the exchange, according to a transaction published in the security notice.

The disclosure comes hours after Zhao tweeted that the exchange was undertaking “some unscheduled server maintenance,” writing that “funds are #safu.” After the disclosure announcement, Zhao tweeted that the exchange would “provide a more detailed update shortly.”

The exchange may not yet have identified all impacted accounts, he said. And according to Binance’s statement, the breach only impacted Binance’s hot wallet, which contains roughly 2 percent of the exchange’s total bitcoin holdings.

“All of our other wallets are secure and unharmed,” he said, adding:

“The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-prepared actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time. The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.”

The withdrawal triggered internal alarms after it was executed, and Zhao said the exchange froze withdrawals following the discovery. While deposits and withdrawals will remain suspended for the next week, trading will be re-enabled, though he cautioned that “the hackers may still control certain user accounts.”

Binance will conduct “a thorough security review” encompassing its systems and data during the next week.

The exchange will use its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU fund) to cover the loss, which won’t impact users, according to the notice.

The fund consists of 10 percent of all trading fees absorbed by the exchange, and was initially launched to protect Binance’s users “in extreme cases,” according to a previous notice. It is stored in its own cold wallet.

“In this difficult time, we strive to maintain transparency and would be appreciative of your support,” Zhao said Tuesday.

He concluded the note by saying he would participate in a previously scheduled Twitter “ask-me-anything.”

Markets react

Prices have so far responded with bitcoin, the world’s premier cryptocurrency, dropping $290 alongside most other cryptocurrencies, which are down between 1-10 percent at press time.

Litecoin and ether both experienced between 4-6 percent losses while bitcoin managed to resume in the green, thanks largely to its bullish rally yesterday that saw prices reach as high as $5,972 on the Coinbase exchange.

Binance’s native crypto, Binance Coin (BNB), is also down 8.05 percent and unable to escape the controversy from today’s news.

BNB’s price is continuing to search for a bottom after it broke from a range it had held for 18 days between $22 and $25.40, with a new all-time high at $26.44 on May 3.

Look for new content from well-known and respected crypto writer Tanzeel Akhtar every week.

(Kitco News) - Occasionally the Bitcoin (BTC) whales will come out to play, today BTC price is hovering around the $6,200 mark. When can we expect to see more action?

Those trading crypto will often hear the term ""whale"" and as the name suggests it is used to describe huge cryptocurrency holders. Those Bitcoin wallets with around $1 billion are referred to as whales. Putting any future price target on BTC is notoriously difficult due to these whales being blamed for unexplained market phenomenon.

Per Wimmer, a former Goldman Sachs banker and the founder of Wimmer Financial LLP, a London-based corporate-advisory firm, explains: “The crypto market is dominated mainly by ten big whales or privates. They are massive in the market and take up a lot space and volume so if you take the top 10 or even 50 you will have a lot of the volume covered already. It is too easy to manipulate the market so far.”

Wimmer who has extensive connections in the family office and private capital worlds disagrees with the widespread rumors that institutional players are entering the space. Due to the increase in crypto crime and exchange hackings resulting in millions being stolen this has put institutional investors off.

He adds, “Crypto is very niche. It is here to stay and remain for a considerable amount of time as a niche [investment]. There is a degree of validity about crypto. I like the fact it is intimidating governments. I think it is great to have that aspect of it.”

Price Manipulation

There are many trading manoeuvres Bitcoin whales will use to profit, such as the trading tactic commonly called the ""rinse and repeat cycle.” This is when a trader or whale with huge holdings starts selling bitcoins lower than the market rate which causes a panic sell off by small-time traders. The whale will then have sold just below the current market value and enough to watch panic ensue. Then the whale waits and watches the panic selling take place until the Bitcoin prices reach a new low. This is the time when the whales quickly scoop up more Bitcoins hence the term 'rinse' and then ‘repeat.’

André Bruckmann, the founder of Mycro explains, “Price manipulations at Bitcoin are extremely expensive due to its liquidity, essentially benefiting no one. For example, if a large Bitcoin holder sells large quantities of BTC, the price will only fall if it is placed at the market price and this will lose money. The same applies if a large investor places a large buy order for BTC at the market price - the price rises and he buys at too high a price. Large volumes are usually settled OTC and this does not affect the price on exchanges at all.”

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) and the CEO of IOHK says: “The thing about our [crypto] industry is that it tends to move in spurts. It kind of spikes up, dies down and stays flat for a long period of time. Then there’s another spike and its boom time again. Regardless of when you come in there is always going to be spikes.”

According to Hoskinson, the next spurt will come from institutional money and the dawn of security token offerings. “The really smart money is aware that the market is not yet stable. It is not at the level of maturity to support institutional surge. Within the next 12 to 24 months I think the environment will be ready for institutional money to enter and it will enter with a toe in the pool.” adds Hoskinson.

In this current state prices are open to manipulation and with an unregulated crypto market many institutional investors are watching from the sidelines.",2019-05-07,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-social-media-giant-wechat-bans-crypto-transactions-in-its-payment-policy,"Chinese social media giant and payment service provider WeChat banned cryptocurrency transactions in its payments policy. Dovey Wan, founding partner of crypto investment firm Primitive, tweeted the news on May 7.

The tweet contained a screenshot of the policy changes, which intimates that users who engage in cryptocurrency trading will have their accounts terminated.

Wan expressed concern that since most over-the-counter transactions are happening in WeChat, “this may impact local liquidity to quite some extent.” WeChat is a popular messaging and payments service provider in China, also featuring game integrations.

The updated rules — coming into force on May 31 — state that “merchants may not engage in illegal transactions such as virtual currency,"" the issuance of tokens, selling pornography or online gambling.

Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, commented that he believes the restrictions have been forced on the company. Furthermore, Zhao also defined the developments “a classic example of short term pain, long term gain.” He explained:

“It is inconvenient for people short term, and they take a hit. But long term, it is precisely this type of restriction of freedom that will push people to use crypto. Not a bad thing.”

Lastly, he noted that it would be hard to beat the user experience offered by the WeChat payment services if it wasn’t for such restrictions.

WeChat Pay reportedly registered a total daily transaction volume of over 1 billion (currency unspecified), while the overall number of users allegedly reached 1.098 billion by the end of last year. According to technology news outlet TechNode, the app is also popular among older people, with 98.5% of Chinese people aged between 50 and 80 WeChat users.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, major Chinese city Guangzhou has issued a business license using blockchain and artificial intelligence technology also featuring a WeChat integration.

Zebpay has expanded its trading services to Australia by opening a new office in the fintech hub of Melbourne. The exchange’s Australian customers are now able to trade across five fiat to crypto trading pairs including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) both on desktop and Android and iOS apps.

To conduct operations in Australia, Zebpay has acquired a license with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre — Australia's financial intelligence agency with regulatory responsibility for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing — and became a member of the Australian Digital Commerce Association.

Sandeep Khurana, Zebpay’s Australia Director, said that “Australia is an ideal market for Zebpay’s services with its clear stance on regulation, openness to fintech innovation and thirst for crypto products.”

Last October, Zebpay had to close its doors to its Indian customers due to the country’s crypto banking ban. Citing “extremely difficult” conditions it encountered attempting to process customer orders in the current environment, the exchange gave just several hours’ notice of the decision before closing.

Prior to that, Zebpay froze Indian rupee deposits and withdrawals on July 4, 2018, a day before the bank ban on cryptocurrency businesses came into effect. In a warning statement, Zebpay said that events at the time were “beyond its control,” having previously warned users that rupee deposits and withdrawals could stop if the ruling from the Reserve Bank of India (RBOI) went ahead.

A year after an RBOI circular banned the country’s financial institutions from dealing with crypto-related business, the country’s officials are reportedly considering an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. Local reports from late April 2019 state that a draft bill that would ban cryptocurrency is circulating among various departments of the Indian government.",

One of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges says hackers stole $40 million worth of bitcoin.

The Taiwan-based exchange, Binance, discovered the security breach Tuesday and said it would cover all losses from its funds.

Watch Bitcoin trade live.

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced a hack of $40 million worth of bitcoin. In a statement posted on the company's site, the exchange said it ""discovered a large scale security breach"" on Tuesday.

The exact amount of bitcoin stolen amounted to 7,047.2 coins, and the company said it would cover all losses using funds from its reserve accounts. Customer holdings will not be affected, it said.

""The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time,"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks.""

The company also said the hackers were able to obtain sensitive information such as application programming interface keys, which are similar to ""tokens"" users require to access accounts.

Binance said the hackers employed sophisticated techniques that involved phishing and viruses and targeted the company's ""hot wallet,"" where bitcoin holdings are connected to the internet, as opposed to ""cold wallets,"" which are stored offline. The exchange said its hot-wallet holdings were less than 2% of its total holdings.

""This shows how centralized Bitcoin, exchanges and all cryptocurrencies really are and how no cryptocurrency at the moment can currently stop these potential issues from arising,"" said Richard Dennis, the founder of the decentralized crypto network Temtum.

Exchange hacks have become an increasing concern for bitcoin holders. The cryptocurrency, which is prized for its reputation as a ""secure"" asset, has faced a series of losses, including an incident in which the CEO of an exchange died with sole access to the ""cold storage"" accounts of $137 million in cryptocurrency belonging to about 115,000 customers.

In addition, the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit in April against the Hong Kong-based iFinex, accusing the exchange of mixing client funds with its own capital to hide the fact that $850 million went missing in 2018.

Binance announced a suspension of withdrawals until an investigation, expected to take one week, could be completed. Customers will still be allowed to adjust their position holdings while the investigation is ongoing, it said.

Bitcoin prices remain volatile. After plunging from its December 2017 peak of $19,891, the cryptocurrency has made a recovery in 2019. Bitcoin is up 57% from its 2018 year-end price of $3,732. Markets Insider

“Hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info,” according to Binance’s statement. “The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks.”

The crypto exchange says that its Secure Asset Fund for Users, which it has referred to as an “emergency insurance fund,” will cover the losses so users won’t lose any money. Still, Binance says deposits and withdrawals will be suspended for about a week during a security review.

“We will continue to enable trading, so that you may adjust your positions if you wish,” according to the company. “Please also understand that the hackers may still control certain user accounts and may use those to influence prices in the meantime. We will monitor the situation closely. But we believe with withdrawals disabled, there isn’t much incentive for hackers to influence markets.”

While the theft is large, it’s not the largest crypto theft on record: Last year, Japanese exchange Coincheck reported $530 million worth of a digital currency called NEM had been stolen, and the infamous theft at early exchange Mt. Gox saw more than 750,000 bitcoin go missing.",2019-05-08 11:34:37,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/08/binance-says-hackers-stole-million-worth-bitcoin-one-transaction/,"The heist builds on the explosive growth in cryptocurrency crime and investor scams, which increased more than 400 percent in 2018 and added up to about $1.7 billion in losses, according to the cybersecurity firm CipherTrace. More than half that total, or $950 million, was taken from exchanges such as Binance and wallets that allow people to store digital currencies.

Many people are drawn to bitcoin because they can make transactions anonymously. Though the trades are recorded in public transactions, individual account holders are not personally identifiable, a key reason the cryptocurrency is so appealing to criminals. Law enforcement agencies do have ways of tracking stolen bitcoin, however, including tying a person’s known IP address to their bitcoin transactions and tracing how hackers exchange large amounts of bitcoin into hard currency.

Binance said the theft affected one of its Internet-connected wallets, which contained about 2 percent of its total bitcoin holdings. The company said that no user money will be affected and that insurance will cover the losses in full.

“It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed,” Binance said in a statement. “Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system. We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that.”

Even cryptocurrency investors unscathed by hacks and scammers are still feeling the pain of a market that has dwindled in value. At its peak, in December 2017, bitcoin was worth nearly $20,000, igniting a buying frenzy that helped propel the esoteric world of cryptocurrency into the mainstream. Several companies hoping to cash in on the hysteria even changed their names to include the word “blockchain” — the technology that drives the virtual currency — sparking widespread amusement and mockery.

By February 2018, bitcoin’s value was cut in half. Then in December, a year after its peak, bitcoin had fallen below $4,000, a drop of more than 80 percent. The rest of the cryptocurrency market soon followed bitcoin’s lead.

The price of bitcoin fell about 3 percent Tuesday after Binance’s announcement, but it has since recovered, according to Coinbase, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. As of Wednesday afternoon, bitcoin was trading at $5,901.

According to the cryptocurrency tracker CoinMarketCap, the global market capitalization for all digital currencies was $113 billion at the end of January, down more than 86 percent from its all-time high a year earlier.",2019-05-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/facebook-rolls-back-ban-on-cryptocurrency-ads.html,"Facebook on Wednesday said it is loosening its ban on ads related to blockchain and cryptocurrency, allowing more businesses working on those technologies to promote their efforts on the social network.

Facebook first started blocking ads promoting cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in January 2018 over concerns that users might be scammed by initial coin offerings offered by some crypto start-ups. The company loosened its ban in June to allow ads from advertisers who received prior written approval. Now, it is further rolling back the policy so that many types of ads will no longer require approval.

""We've listened to feedback and assessed the policy's effectiveness,"" Facebook said Wednesday in a blog post. ""While we will still require people to apply to run ads promoting cryptocurrency, starting today, we will narrow this policy to no longer require pre-approval for ads related to blockchain technology, industry news, education or events related to cryptocurrency.""

The company has come under scrutiny over the wide reach of this policy over the past year.

In October, CNBC highlighted the ban's impact on Bloom, a San Francisco start-up that uses blockchain technology to help people keep control over their personal data online. Bloom had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook ads to promote its services, but the saw all of its ads suddenly banned by the social network in October.

""It's good to see them (hopefully) evolve their stance on new technology that puts users in control of their data,"" said Shannon Wu of Bloom in a statement.

Facebook's rollback of this ban comes amid reports that the company is working on its own blockchain project. In December, Bloomberg reported that the company is building a so-called stablecoin that will allow WhatsApp users to send cryptocurrency payments to one another. Facebook has been in talks with dozens of financial firms and e-commerce companies to support the initiative, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

Advertisements on the social network about blockchain technology and industry news will no longer require pre-approval.

The company clamped down on blockchain and bitcoin-related ads a year ago amid a wave of scams.

The change comes as the company is rumoured to be preparing to announce its own cryptocurrency to power payments.

Facebook is relaxing its ban on crypto-related ads.

On Wednesday, the social networking giant announced that it was loosening its rules around blockchain and digital currencies. Some types of ads will remain banned, or, at the very least, require pre-approval. But users will now be able to run ads ""related to blockchain technology, industry news, education or events related to cryptocurrency"" no approval required, Facebook said.

The change comes 16 months after Facebook first banned all ads for bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and ICOs amid a wave of scams and shady schemes in the industry. It subsequently allowed some ads related to the tech, but only if they were pre-approved.

And the change of heart arrives as rumours swirl about Facebook's own ambitions in the crypto space, and news leaks out about the efforts of its secretive blockchain team.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg came out with a new report that said the company could announce its own cryptocurrency to power payments in the third quarter of 2019, and that project head David Marcus (former PayPal president) is quietly building a 50-strong team comprised in part of ex-PayPal employees.

Facebook has thus far stayed mum about the direction its blockchain team is taking, and it was conspicuously absent from F8, Facebook's major developer conference, earlier this month.

On the ads side, Facebook says it will still require pre-approval for advertisements that directly promote cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency exchanges, and that ads for ICOs (initial coin offerings, a form of crypto-powered fundraising) will remain banned.

""We're committed to preventing misleading advertising on our platforms, especially in the area of financial products and services. Because of this, people who want to promote cryptocurrency and closely related products like cryptocurrency exchanges and mining software and hardware, will still have to go through a review process,"" the company said in a blog post announcing the change.

""This process will continue to take into account licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange (or are a subsidiary of a public company) and other relevant public background on their business.""

Economist Nouriel Roubini, who for many years wore the sobriquet ""Dr. Doom,"" said bitcoin and its peers don't even deserve to be called ""cryptocurrencies."" Investor and former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz said Roubini is underestimating the sector's future, and challenged him to put his pride where his mouth is.

""Bitcoin is at $6,000 now,"" Novogratz told Roubini during a panel discussion at the SALT 2019 conference in Las Vegas. ""If at Christmastime it's above $6,000, you have to wear a shirt that says, 'I love bitcoin.' If it's not, I will wear a T-shirt saying, 'Nouriel was right.'"" (Bitcoin traded around $5,885 Wednesday afternoon and is off 37% over the past 12 months.)

Roubini didn't directly respond to the challenge, and in fact said he doesn't care about bitcoin's fate.

However, he earlier launched a barrage of criticism against the $186 billion industry, saying its products like bitcoin and ethereum lack the fundamental qualities of currencies and shouldn't be labeled as such.

""Crypto is the mother and father of all bubbles,"" he said.

The term ""cryptocurrency is totally a misnomer,"" he later added. ""To be a currency, you have to be a unit of account, valuable and a scalable means of payment.""

Bitcoin can't be scaled efficiently as it's only capable of seven transactions a second, whereas credit cards can handle thousands of transactions in the same time, he said. It's too volatile to be a stable store of value, and is easily susceptible to fraud like spoofing, pump-and-dump schemes and front running on prices.

""I've never seen such a level of manipulation,"" said Roubini, whose remarks drew a round of audience applause. ""The reality is, these are not currencies.""",2019-05-08 00:00:00,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-highly-risky-not-a-real-currency-ecbs-mario-draghi/,"

“Bitcoins or anything like that are not really currencies, they are assets. A euro is a euro – today, tomorrow, in a month, it’s always a euro. And the ECB is behind the euro. Who is behind the cryptocurrencies? So they are very, very risky assets, the value of which oscillates – as you’ve seen – wildly.”

Draghi does not believe that cryptocurrencies pose a significant impact on existing fiat-based economies.

“At this point in time they are not significant enough in their entity that they could affect our economies in a macro way.”

He believes they are just speculative assets that perhaps need regulation. The macro effect of cryptocurrencies has yet to be seen.

Bitcoin Not Important Enough for ECB to Regulate

Several million people hold cryptocurrencies, and many millions trade them. Still, the overall impact of cryptocurrency on real-world economies has so far been limited.

In the case of Venezuela, inflation and economic woes have left many with no choice but to secure their money in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Dash have acted as a pressure relief valve that didn’t exist in previous eras.

Draghi believes that the ECB currently has no role in the crypto space and that the responsibility of regulating cryptocurrencies mainly falls on consumer protection agencies at this point.

“And so we tend to consider them as speculative assets, highly risky, but as far as the rest is concerned, it’s not really something that pertains to the central bank, the task of monitoring and regulating, possibly, this. It’s more, I would say, something that falls within the consumer protection competence, where you want to make sure that people who buy into these assets know what they do and are aware of the risks they run.”

‘Qualified Investor’ Rules?

This last bit raises an essential question for the EU, however, which is whether or not we can expect regulations similar to those recently proposed in Russia. Russians may face a situation soon where they have to be qualified investors, complete with a background in economics, to trade in cryptocurrencies. If similar regulations were put in place in Western Europe, a massive damper on regulated crypto trading would effectively arise.

That prospect raises even more critical questions about the long-term future of cryptocurrency. Brilliant people have determined that Bitcoin cannot adequately be banned through criminalization, even as Nobel laureates call for precisely that.

France, for its part, has led the way in fostering a pro-blockchain environment. Countries like Malta and Estonia have also created very pro-business, pro-Bitcoin environments, so much so that numerous blockchain companies call these places their official home.

Do these havens have a long future ahead of them, or will governments in the EU eventually decide to raise the bar for investing in cryptocurrency? If Draghi’s comments are any indication of the general opinion of crypto trading, it seems very feasible that such regulations will eventually emerge.",2019-05-08 15:29:41+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-reveals-136-million-losses-for-2018-eyes-market-uptrend,"Canadian bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8 made almost $50 million in revenue last year but triggered total losses of almost $140 million, according to an annual earnings report released on May 6.

Hut 8, which counts itself as one of the world’s largest publicly-traded cryptocurrency mining companies, saw 2018 revenue hit $49.4 million.

The company’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the year was $19.3 million. Losses amounted to $136.7 million.

Hut 8 currently operates 85 mining centers worldwide, with 2018’s mixed performance reflecting the fate of many mining businesses during the cryptocurrency bear market.

As Cointelegraph reported, like stalwarts such as Bitmain, Hut 8 was forced to cut costs in the first quarter of 2019, reports surfacing last month of staff layoffs.

“Due to the ‘crypto winter’, which was marked by a declining price for bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, 2018 was a challenging year for all cryptocurrency miners. While many miners did not survive, Hut 8 managed its cash and digital assets conservatively to successfully make it through,” the earnings report summarized. It continued:

“Today, Hut 8 is stable and poised to benefit from a recovery in the price of bitcoin. The Company will continue to manage operations prudently and with focus.”

That focus will continue to revolve exclusively around bitcoin mining over other cryptocurrencies, with executives eyeing a continued uptrend in bitcoin prices in the near term.

“Throughout 2018, Hut 8’s average cost per bitcoin was consistently below the market price of bitcoin,” COO Andrew Kiguel commented. He added:",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-complex-relationship-with-crypto,"A blow was struck to the crypto community in India in late April as reports circulated regarding a proposed ban on cryptocurrencies. India has a strong and passionate community of crypto enthusiasts, however, their steadfast belief in the value of cryptocurrency does not appeared to be mirrored in the diverse organs of the Indian state. Cointelegraph takes a deep dive into the latest developments in the Indian crypto sector and speaks to the experts determined to stick out this turbulent period for investors.

Ban rumor shakes Indian crypto community

In a development set to further consolidate the Indian government’s reputation for a faltering approach toward cryptocurrency, rumors circulated in late April that various government divisions are considering tabling an absolute ban on crypto in all its forms, according to The Economic Times.

The local publication reportedly contacted an official familiar with this latest attempt to ban cryptocurrency in the country. According to the official, the draft bill named “Banning Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019” is currently being discussed by several ministers from a number of government divisions.

Although the draft bill has yet to be written into law, it appears that it is already garnering support from various groups attached to the government. A committee formed of — but not limited to — the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), along with the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) has allegedly aligned with the decision to outright ban the sale, purchase and the issuance of cryptocurrencies in all their forms.

In addition to the 2019 draft bill, the committee is reportedly exploring options to ban digital currencies under the auspices of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Despite the reporting conducted by The Economic Times, not all members of the crypto community are convinced that the ban is likely to take place at all. Mohammed Danish, a lawyer representing crypto-fraud victims in Indian courts and legal advisor to the crypto news content site Crypto Kanoon, notes that there has not yet been any official government statement regarding the alleged bill:

“The discussion about banning crypto in India' finds its source in few news articles and the same has not been confirmed by any official press release till date. However, let's assume that the news is absolutely correct and the inter-governmental committee is inclined to propose a ban on Crypto. The Committee appears to have based its ban proposal mainly on two major grounds viz. 'money laundering' and 'investor protection.”

Beyond the speculation enshrouding the very existence of the crypto ban bill, Danish elaborated that, even in the event that the bill does go through, it could end up being counterintuitive:

“The committee is failing to appreciate that a law can only make the crypto-activity punishable but it can never control/stop the operation/use of Crypto given to its decentralized nature. It cannot be eradicated from the grey market. A law banning crypto would only help the miscreants as on one hand it will create a dark heaven for the miscreants to defraud and on the other hand the fraud victims will be seen as complicit due to which they will hesitate in seeking redressal even in case of genuine frauds. On the contrary, if the Govt. decides to regulate Crypto in some or the other way, it will at least have some control over the activity to stop the vices. It will also help in achieving financial goals.”

Prior government committees come to completely different conclusions

The 2019 draft bill is the latest in a series of contradictory actions by the Indian government concerning cryptocurrencies in recent months. Thus, in December, at least two government committees came to diametrically opposed conclusions regarding the legalization and regulation of cryptocurrencies in India within just weeks of each other.

One committee ruled that all cryptocurrencies should be legalized. An unnamed, yet senior official that attended the committee’s cryptocurrency panel said that crypto legalization is inevitable:

“There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalized with strong riders.”

Only a few weeks earlier, a separate government panel meeting put forward a new legal framework within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) advocating for a total ban on cryptocurrencies, stating that “any kind of dealing in such currencies should be treated as ‘illegal.’”

The Indian government allegedly set up the panel with the aim of establishing a series of “norms” for digital currencies. The committee was fronted by Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Subhash Chandra Garg and submitted its findings in the form of a report to Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

It’s also important to note that RBI executive director Ganesh Kumar took part in discussions with representatives from G-20 countries calling for the taxation and regulation of cryptocurrencies in order to minimize their use in illicit activity.

Where does the indecision surrounding crypto in India stem from?

Although the country has a chequered past regarding openness to cryptocurrencies, it could be argued that the debate regarding either banning or legalizing them began in earnest in April 2018, when the RBI announced its decision to sever ties with those dealing in cryptocurrencies.

In the bank’s release entitled “Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,” published on April 5, the RBI outlined its support for the technological innovations supporting cryptocurrencies as having “the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. [...] Virtual Currencies (VCs) [...] raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.”

Despite this initial glimpse of positivity, the RBI soon laid bare its animosity toward cryptocurrencies themselves, stating that it had issued warnings to individuals involved with the crypto industry about “various risks.” The bank further commented that it viewed the risks seriously enough to rescind their offer of services to involved individuals or businesses:

“In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time.”

Speaking at a press conference on April 5, RBI Deputy Governor Bibhu Prasad Kanungo outlined his view that cryptocurrencies could potentially have the power to “endanger financial stability”:

“Internationally, while the regulatory response to these tokens are not uniform, it is universally felt that they can seriously undermine the AML (anti-money laundering) and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) framework, adversely impact market integrity and capital control. And if they grow beyond a critical size, they can endanger financial stability as well.”

CEO and co-founder of Indian Unocoin Sathvik Vishwanath told Cointelegraph that the RBI’s stance has had an adverse impact on both Indians and cryptocurrency usage:

“The present stance of RBI has not only reduced the number of transactions that happening for buying and selling of cryptos but it also has hurt the sentiments of Indians. To get more adoption and acceptance of crypto, initially the government should first clear its stance about crypto followed by the lifting the banking ban for these transactions and finally coming up with the suitable regulations for both trading and payment systems of crypto.”

India’s digital currency development – on pause

In addition to the RBI’s damning comments regarding cryptocurrencies, the bank announced on Jan. 1 that it would pause its plans to develop and release a digital currency. Initially due for release in April of this year, the RBI confirmed in August that the digital currency would be backed by the rupee in an effort to combat the rising cost of printing paper and the popularity of digital coin usage.

A report published by Indian business news outlet The Hindu Business Line quoted an unidentified source who said that the government had had a change of heart:

“The government doesn’t want the digital currency any more. It thinks it is too early to even think about a digital currency.”

Despite an unstable crypto environment in which any potential fintech advancement could help bring about wider adoption, not all members of the crypto community were on board with the digital currency initiative to begin with. The founder of local cryptocurrency exchange Belfrics, Praveen Kumar, said that now was not the time for the launch:

“It is premature for RBI to launch crypto-rupee, as more understanding of the crypto economy need to be achieved. It is a right decision to delay the process and see how the publicly traded peer-to-peer economy is shaping up.””

This was not the first instance in which India’s financial institutions made clear their aversions to cryptocurrencies, a prime example of this being the Indian Finance Ministry’s criticism of bitcoin as having a lack of intrinsic value. Prior to this, Indian banks began to limit the functionality of crypto exchange accounts. The atmosphere darkened for Indian crypto enthusiasts to the extent that false media rumors regarding a country-wide ban in early February 2018 led to a drop in crypto markets at the time.

Why is crypto dividing opinions in India?

With the government’s indecision regarding cryptocurrencies ostensibly representing the most significant hurdle for adoption and usage in India, it appears that the quantity of theories seeking to explain the government’s position on crypto are as numerous as the committees set up to decide its fate.

Sathvik Vishwanath told Cointelegraph that this hesitant approach is not atypical of the Indian government regarding new technology:

“India is a conservative country. In the past it has only taken the stance of encouraging a technology after it being able to fully regulate. India also has the history of taking knee-jerk reaction when they’re not capable of understanding the pros and cons at hand. We hope crypto industry don’t become prey.”

Evan Luthra, an entrepreneur and blockchain expert, outlined his view in an interview, saying to Cointelegraph that India’s large geographic size, bureaucracy and population all play a part in the shaping of the government’s inconsistent approach to regulating cryptocurrencies:

“The problem with India and cryptocurrencies is that India is a billion people. It’s a lot of different states that are working with blockchain and cryptocurrency. There are different levels and there is the state government which is also responsible for setting out how the currencies are regulated and how cryptocurrencies are regulated in India.”

Luthra also said that it’s important to note that crypto’s existing association with illegal activity is admittedly hard to shake off, though outweighed by the potential benefits that could be brought about in future:

“While we see a lot of progress happening in India and multiple state governments pressing forward with blockchain and blockchain based solutions, India has also been the leader when it comes to scam projects. This is because every time an industry grows so fast, there is bound to be scams around it.

“In a cash rich economy like india, cryptocurrency has the highest potential to make a big impact. But before we get to that level to see that positive impact, there are definitely going to be a few bad players. And to remove them there’s going to be a rollercoaster ride, involving many ups and downs. We’re going to have to wait for the government officials to understand this technology and these cryptocurrencies.”

Although instances of crypto crime in India are well documented, Danish believes that the reputation of cryptocurrencies can weather the storm:

“The fact that Crypto is packed with the power of decentralization, it is impossible for it to get rid of this ascription. However, it is pertinent to note that no law has been able to achieve 100% result ever. Despite having in place many strict laws, no crime has ever been extinguished completely. We have cases of murders despite Section 302 IPC prescribing life imprisonment for its commission. The best which can be done is to rein crypto in such a manner that the ease provided by it to the wrong doers can be curtailed considerably.”

What could happen?

Although the government appears to be set on either finding a thorough method of regulating cryptocurrencies or banning them altogether, many members of the Indian crypto community are firm in their belief that, as understanding of the technology grows, adoption and acceptance is sure to follow. Thus, Evan Luthra says that, despite any regulatory measures, cryptocurrencies will survive, and it’s up to governments to decide which side of history they want to be on:

“As they understand it better every day, regulation will change. As the regulation keeps changing, that will bring the volatility and the hostility that we see right now. The best way for the government to move forward is to accept that fact that cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere. Either they can join the bandwagon or they can be left aside and cryptocurrencies will survive, with or without the government anyways.”

For Danish, education and awareness are the two key factors that will shift the current government impasse in India. Danish also explained that the imposition of a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies wouldn’t be a one-trick fix — as without education, members of the public would still be vulnerable to “crypto-crimes” and instances of fraud:

“I think there is a need for running general awareness programs about Blockchain, Crypto and Crypto frauds. Illiterate and non-tech savvy people are more prone to fall prey to the ponzi schemes which falsely promise higher returns. I would emphasize that if at all the Govt. decides to ban it, it must make provision for Crypto education so that the people are capable of protecting themselves from the crypto-crimes and criminals in the post-ban era as both these things are going to survive the ban. A Crypto ban can only kill innovation but not the crypto-crime.”

With the government’s track record of changing its attitude toward crypto several times in quick succession, it looks like crypto is set to have a complicated path toward acceptance in India, should it ever get to that point. With the upcoming general election set to conclude on May 23, India risks a completely new government and, potentially, a completely new approach to cryptocurrency. With mixed signals from the current government and the spectre of a potentially damning new bill lurking in the shadows, the future of crypto in India remains to be seen.",

The political tension in Venezuela has affected local cryptocurrency adoption. While there are roadblocks, many crypto-advocating projects continue to thrive in the country. News.Bitcoin.com takes a deep look at the current situation in Venezuela, crypto adoption efforts and how the recent political crisis affects them.

Political Turmoil and Economy in Freefall

Cryptocurrency adoption in Venezuela has been affected by the recent political unrest following mass protests organized by Juan Guaido, president of the opposition-run National Assembly, calling for the military to help him end Nicolas Maduro’s reign. With the support of more than 50 countries including the U.S., Guaido declared himself acting president of Venezuela while Maduro insists he has been re-elected to a second six-year term. The incumbent still has the support of a number of countries including Russia and China.

During the years-long freefall of their country’s economy, many Venezuelans have turned to cryptocurrencies. Venezuela’s annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November last year, according to the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

Widespread food and medical supply shortages are now the norm, with most Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items including food and toiletries. Although Venezuela is prime for crypto adoption, there are still many challenges in the way.

Crypto Adoption Remains Strong

Seemingly a natural fit for such a failing economy, cryptocurrency adoption is progressing in Venezuela despite some roadblocks. Matt Aaron, leader of Bitcoin.com’s efforts in the country, explained how the recent political situation and ongoing power outages have affected local merchant crypto adoption.

Citing the political unrest, the frequent and lengthy blackouts, and the skyrocketing prices of goods and services due to shortages of basic necessities, Aaron admitted that “It’s really affected the crypto adoption.” However, he emphasized:

I think it’s still strong, it’s just that in the short term, they’re in survival mode in certain parts. But the willingness to learn about crypto has not gone down.

Despite political unrest, Venezuelans continue to trade cryptocurrencies. On over-the-counter marketplace Localbitcoins, 1,137 BTC were traded in the week ending May 4, only slightly less than the 1,228 BTC traded in the prior week. Bitcoin cash data is not provided by this platform but Bitcoin.com will soon launch Local Bitcoin Cash for anyone to directly exchange BCH.

How Cryptocurrencies Help Venezuelans

Many people in Venezuela have found refuge in cryptocurrency. Carlos Hernández, a Venezuelan living in Ciudad Guayana, has shared how cryptocurrencies saved his family. Citing hyperinflation, he divulged:

I don’t own bolívars, Venezuela’s official currency. I keep all of my money in bitcoin. Keeping it in bolívars would be financial suicide.

Ricardo Carrasco is a Venezuelan who earns cryptocurrencies from freelance work online. He recently left his country because the constant blackouts made it impossible for him to work from Venezuela. He told news.Bitcoin.com Wednesday that, in the city of Merida where he lived, the power went out five consecutive days in March after it went out for two days the prior week.

“For a number of years now the Venezuelan government has been upholding a currency exchange control that does not let us freely access the international market,” Carrasco described. In addition, the U.S. has employed sanctions as a policy tool in response to activities of the Venezuelan government and individuals for more than a decade. “Now that the Trump administration has blocked our financial access to the world even further,” Carrasco opined: “Cryptocurrencies are super valuable because they allow us to bypass that … it’s also an asset that can gain in value and … if your minimum wage is less than $10 a month, you can see the potential for growth if you have crypto.”

Maduro Also Seeks Solution in Crypto

In an attempt to solve his country’s devastating economic problems, Maduro launched a new currency called the petro in February last year which he initially claimed to be a cryptocurrency backed by oil. However, he later declared that the petro was no longer fully backed by oil but was also partially backed by gold, iron, and diamond. Skeptics are calling his scheme a scam, pointing to several pieces of evidence such as the lack of wallet to hold the petro and the nonexistent block explorer.

Nonetheless, the National Superintendency of Cryptoassets and Related Activities (Sunacrip), the Maduro government-appointed regulator of crypto assets, has been selling the petro at its headquarters and issuing savings certificates to buyers. Recently, a crypto exchange authorized by Sunacrip, Amberes Coin, claims that the petro has been trading on its platform as well as over-the-counter on social media despite having no wallet or block explorer.

In January, the Maduro government established the Integral System of Cryptoassets, as published in Official Gazette number 41.575. It empowers Sunacrip “as the top regulatory entity in this matter, reinforcing, in addition, the entire initial ecosystem that since 2018 has been formed to give solidity and confidence to the petro, the sovereign Venezuelan cryptoasset,” Sunacrip wrote on its website. The regulator immediately proceeded to start controlling crypto activities in the country and offering its own crypto remittance service. Scam or not, the petro represents the first time any government has run its own cryptocurrency and related services, thereby creating awareness of cryptocurrencies and legitimizing them to the public.

Two other crypto-related regulations were published by the Maduro government — one on Feb. 4 in Official Gazette number 41.578 and the other in Official Gazette number 41.581 on Feb. 7.

Airdropvenezuela

A number of nonprofit organizations such as Airdropvenezuela are using cryptocurrency to help people in need. The nonprofit’s website states that “Due to artificially-rigged government exchange rates, the banks in Venezuela are not used for remittance, payments, or donations,” asserting:

Venezuela needs better money. Venezuela needs cryptocurrency. Ten dollars can help a family purchase food, medicine, and scarce imported goods.

“Access to digital money can help introduce Venezuelans to cryptocurrencies, online freelancer platforms, ecommerce, investments, donations and other income generating web-based opportunities,” Airdropvenezuela believes.

The project aims to send $1,000,000 in digital money to 100,000 ID-authenticated Venezuelan Airtm users who log into their accounts between Nov. 27 last year and July 31. “The first 100k Airtm Venezuelan users to be verified and have logged into their account during the campaign period will be a recipient of $10 once we achieve our $1,000,000 USD equivalent goal,” the nonprofit announced.

In addition to U.S. dollars, donations can be made in a number of cryptocurrencies including BCH and BTC. They are sent directly to Airtm wallets which connect buyers and sellers to over 200 banking networks and e-money systems globally, including Venezuela’s.

As of this writing, $273,668 have been raised and 62,541 users have been verified, the project’s website reveals.

Cryptocurrency totals less than $10,000 will be converted into U.S. dollars upon distribution, Airdropvenezuela clarifies. At the time of this writing, the nonprofit has raised the most in BCH, followed by U.S. dollars and BTC. Donations in bitcoin cash make up more than half of all donations received.

BCH donations got a kick start when Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver matched them for 24 hours on Dec. 10 last year. “Total funds raised have more than doubled since @Rogerkver announced yesterday that he would match BCH contributions. Congrats BCH community for jumping to #1 place in less than 24 hrs,” Airtm tweeted. “The bigger the network effect a currency has, the more useful that currency becomes. This is a great way to grow the network for Bitcoin Cash and help people in need at the same time,” Ver remarked.

150 Merchants Onboarded so Far

A growing number of merchants in Venezuela are now accepting bitcoin cash thanks to an initiative by Bitcoin.com to make the process easy for them. At the North American Bitcoin Conference in February, COO Mate Tokay unveiled the company’s ambitious goal to onboard 500 merchants per month to accept bitcoin cash.

Aaron confirmed that, while there are other projects Bitcoin.com is indirectly affiliated with, his primary focus is getting merchants to accept BCH, elaborating:

We’re focused in Caracas, have around 150 merchants so far … we’re teaching them how to use bitcoin cash, how to convert to dollars and bolivares, and to show them the advantages.

He proceeded to outline the benefits of accepting the cryptocurrency for merchants such as instant transactions, being able to accept payments without a payment processor, and avoiding high credit card processing fees of about 6%. In comparison, paying with BCH only incurs a network fee that is usually below one cent.

“We have a support network on Whatsapp and Telegram” so “store owners can come to us with their questions,” Aaron continued, noting that shop owners have many questions about accepting bitcoin cash. He believes that this support structure sets his efforts apart from other similar initiatives, emphasizing that the first step is getting merchants to accept BCH before convincing more people to use it and considering other projects such as remittance payments. “So many things to do, we’re just in the very beginning,” he concluded.

To start accepting bitcoin cash, store owners simply download the Bitcoin.com Wallet which has now been downloaded over 4 million times. Merchants accepting BCH can be found on the Marco Coino map.

Feeding Venezuelans With Crypto

Another organization that relies on cryptocurrency to help Venezuelans is Eatbch. The nonprofit takes bitcoin cash donations and coordinates the purchases of ingredients to serve meals to people in six Venezuelan states. Eatbch celebrated its first year anniversary on Feb. 11. The organization also has a similar initiative in South Sudan.

During blackouts in Venezuela, Eatbch directs donors to visit Venezuela.Bitcoin.com to make donations. Funds sent to Eatbch can be easily tracked using the Badger wallet. BCH enthusiasts can also donate to the merchant adoption campaign in Venezuela. 100% of the donated funds will be used to help increase bitcoin cash adoption in the country through activities such as signing up merchants and educating them how to use the decentralized currency for commerce and remittance payments.

Victories in the war for cryptocurrency adoption in Venezuela may best be described as hard-fought, but lessons being learned by the local crypto community are plentiful. Regardless of how the political turmoil plays out, most every Venezuelan has learned the value of their money and now knows about cryptocurrencies, largely due to the Maduro government’s efforts to push the petro. Many of their lives have been touched personally by the efforts and projects like the ones listed above. It seems to be only a matter of time until crypto’s broad acceptance in the country finally arrives.

When do you think cryptocurrencies will finally be used by the mainstream in Venezuela? Let us know in the comments section below.

The news of the Binance hack left the cryptocurrency industry rattled. Although, it turns out that a massive $40 million’s worth of BTC doesn’t even register this heist among the worst. Check out the five biggest exchange hacks in crypto history.

The 5 Biggest Exchange Hacks in Crypto

As you can see from the above image, the Binance hack comes in a measly sixth place. There’s no doubt that the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange will recover from its stinging loss.

The hacker only targeted Binance’s hot wallet which holds just 2 percent of all the exchange’s BTC. In fact, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is already chalking it up to a “lesson learned” (albeit an expensive one).

cons: 4 While it is a very expensive lesson for us, it is nevertheless a lesson. it was our responsibility to safe guard user funds. We should own up it. We will learn and improve. As always, thank you for your support! — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) May 8, 2019

And, it could have been way worse–just ask Coincheck, the Japanese exchange that still takes first place in the biggest exchange hacks in crypto history.

1. Coincheck (Jan 2018)

According to cryptocurrency intelligence agency CipherTrace, 2018 eclipsed all other years as far as exchange hacks go, with Coincheck leading the way. To kickstart the year that would also be the longest bear market for the industry, Coincheck was hit by hackers stealing more than 500 million NEM cryptocurrency (around $530 million).

NEM stuck the blame firmly on the ‘relaxed security measures’ of Coincheck even though it was only its cryptocurrency XEM that was stolen. No hard fork was carried out and Coincheck, for now at least, retains the top place on the list.

2. Mt. Gox (Feb 2014)

Eclipsed in the dollar amount stolen, the Mt. Gox hack is still undoubtedly the most infamous exchange hack of all time. It’s still the largest Bitcoin heist, in fact, with an eye-watering 850,000 BTC snatched by hackers (around 6 percent of all available BTC at the time).

Up until the start of 2014, Mt. Gox handled some 70 percent of all the world’s BTC transactions. By February of that same year, it was declaring bankruptcy.

While some 200,000 of the stolen BTC was recovered, other users remain hopeful of recuperating their funds. A trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi is now in possession of over 141,000 BTC and 142,000 BCH and is supposed to return them to their rightful owners. The question is, when?

3. BitGrail (Feb 2018)

Shady as they come Italian exchange BitGrail lost some 17 million Nano tokens worth around $170 million in the third biggest exchange hack in crypto history.

While the hack was revealed in 2018, the plot around the story soon began to thicken as users became aware that the exchange had been targeted previously and was insolvent for a number of months prior.

Moreover, its owner Francesco Firano tried to place the blame on Nano, requesting a hard fork to recuperate the funds. This was denied and the blame was laid squarely on BitGrail. In 2019, a court ordered Firano to return the missing funds to BitGrail customers.

4. Bitfinex (Aug 2016)

Controversy over Tether and one of the largest ever exchange hacks in crypto history, it’s a miracle that Bitfinex is still standing. The hack happened in August 2016 when more than 120,000 bitcoins were stolen causing the value of BTC to plummet within hours of the attack.

Users were compensated, however, unlike in many other situations, but they were paid out in BFX tokens rather than BTC.

5. Zaif (Sept 2018)

Losing around $60 million in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and MonaCoin, Zaif was the second major Japanese exchange to lose funds after Coincheck earlier in 2018. This lead to Japan’s FSA to carry out an investigation of the incident.

They later found out the much of the stolen funds were traded on exchanges including Binance and Huobi. Hackers did this by creating hundreds of accounts and depositing just 2 BTC in them all, thus not triggering Binance’s AML red flags.

Don’t Keep Your Funds on an Exchange

We’re watching history repeat itself time and again. Hackers already stole over $356 million from exchanges in Q1, 2019.

The Binance attack is just another in a never-ending security breach waiting to happen and the moral of the story is always the same. Don’t keep your funds on an exchange.

The breach resulted in about 7,074 bitcoins (BTC) — worth nearly $42.8 million at press time — being stolen from the exchange’s hot wallet. The transaction had 44 outputs, 21 of which were native Segregated Witness addresses, and those addresses received 99.97% of the funds.

According to The Block, the funds from those 44 addresses have been reportedly since moved to seven addresses, six of which hold 1,060.6 BTC, while one holds 707.1 BTC. Previously, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing firm Confirm had reported that its analysis showed how 1,227 BTC were moved to two new addresses, one holding 707 coins, while the other one 520.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao devoted his live AMA on Twitter yesterday to address community concerns in the wake of the hack, also discussing the idea of a Bitcoin chain reorganization.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, eight people have been arrested in Spain for allegedly operating a money laundering scheme involving cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this week, famous American economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz reiterated his negative stance on cryptocurrencies, stating that he thinks “we should shut down the cryptocurrencies.”",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-hackers-moved-stolen-btc-to-7-wallet-addresses/,"7,074 Bitcoins stolen from Binance have been transferred to seven Bitcoin addresses.

First pointed out by The Block, 6 of the addresses hold 1,060.6 BTC each while one stores 707.1 BTC. Five of these addresses including the one with 707.1 BTC are Bech32 (SegWit) addresses while the other three are P2PKH addresses.

A single transaction on Tuesday siphoned 7,074 BTC from Binance’s hot wallet. As seen on blockchain analyzing platforms, the transaction had 44 outputs out of which 21 were Bech32 addresses, and 99.97 percent of the stolen funds were transferred to them.

As reported by Finance Magnates yesterday, the crypto exchange revealed the massive attack after unscheduled maintenance which affected deposits and withdrawal on the platform. Binance explained that “a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info” were compromised to carry out the attack.

Binance is one of the largest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume available in the market. The attack on the exchange was the 6th biggest heist the industry has seen so far, involving $40.7 million worth Bitcoins.

Blacklisted addresses

After the attack, the exchange received massive support from the crypto community – both from the traders and its peer exchanges. Major exchanges including Coinbase blacklisted the addresses involved in the attack to prevent the hackers from cashing out the digital currencies in fiat.

I would like to thank all the peer exchanges, wallets, security/analytic teams and other service providers for responding to us and helping us in need, and blocking transactions of fraud funds.

No rollback

Hours after the attack, Twitter was flooded with speculation of a reorganization on Bitcoin’s network to reverse the theft which was initiated after a discussion between Binance’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin.

After an outburst in the community against the move, it was finally confirmed that the exchange is not taking that path.",2019-05-09 12:57:24+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-softens-policy-on-crypto-and-blockchain-ads,"Over a year after its outright ban, Facebook has further lifted some restrictions on cryptocurrency and blockchain-related advertisements.

In an updated policy announced on May 8, the social media firm said ads involving blockchain technology, industry news, educational content or events related to cryptocurrency will no longer require prior written approval.

However, Facebook added it will continue to ban ads related to token sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs), which come under a list of its prohibited products.

Other ads that promote cryptocurrency and closely related products, like cryptocurrency exchanges and mining software and hardware still need to go through a review process to obtain permission to go live on Facebook.

“This process will continue to take into account licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange (or are a subsidiary of a public company) and other relevant public background on their business,” Facebook said.

The company– which has 2.38 billion active monthly users as of March 31, 2019 – initially banned ads involving bitcoin and ICOs in January of last year. Later, in June, the company eased its ban somewhat, allowing certain types of companies to get their ads on the platform with prior permission.

The latest policy update comes amid reports that the company is working on its own fiat-backed cryptocurrency or stablecoin. Facebook is said to be in talks with firms, including Visa and MasterCard, to support and fund the planned $1 billion stablecoin project dubbed “Libra”.

The project is aimed at the development of a cryptocurrency enabling the firm’s billions of users to send money to each other, as well as make online purchases. Further, it seems companies will be able to accept the stablecoin and then use it to pay Facebook for ads.

CNBC reported on Roubini’s declarations on May 9.

During the conference, Roubini also reportedly said that bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets should not be called cryptocurrencies. According to him, “cryptocurrency is totally a misnomer” since “to be a currency, you have to be a unit of account, valuable and a scalable means of payment.""

Roubini also addressed bitcoin’s scalability, stating that while credit cards are capable of thousands of transactions per second, bitcoin’s network can only manage seven. He also claimed to have never witnessed a level of manipulation comparable to what is currently reported by the cryptocurrency market.

CEO of crypto bank Galaxy Digital and former Goldman Sachs partner, Michael Novogratz disagreed, and pointed out bitcoin’s price recovery after 2018’s collapse. He concluded:

“The debate is over, bitcoin won. It is now seen by people all around the world as a legitimate place to [store] their value.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Nouriel Roubini stated that blockchain is “no better than an Excel spreadsheet” during a panel in January.

On the other hand, in February, Novogratz argued that bitcoin occupies a unique place in the cryptocurrency landscape, stating that it “is going to be digital gold, a place where you have sovereign money.”",,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-democrat-ban-cryptocurrencies/,"

By CCN.com: Bitcoin-bashing Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman is urging his colleagues to pass a law that would ban cryptocurrencies in the United States.

“I look for colleagues to join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans, so that we nip this in the bud.”

Congressman Sherman, who’s from California, made the remarks May 9 at a meeting of the House Financial Services Committee.

Sherman says the ban is necessary because crypto threatens to undermine the U.S. dollar and is only useful for criminal activities like money-laundering, drug-dealing, and tax evasion.

Sherman: Crypto fans want to supplant US dollar

Moreover, Sherman notes that crypto evangelists have made no secret of their desire to replace fiat currency. And that is unacceptable to him.

“An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions. Clearing through the New York Fed is critical for major oil and other transactions.” “It is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us, to put us in a position where the most significant sanctions we have against Iran, for example, would become irrelevant.” “So whether it is to disempower our foreign policy, our tax collection enforcement or traditional law enforcement, the advantage of crypto over sovereign currency is solely to aid in the disempowerment of the United States and the rule of law.”

Sherman: Hamas uses bitcoin, case closed

Notably, Congressman Sherman says he’s alarmed by the spike in the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal activity.

He pointed to the example of Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, which has been soliciting bitcoin donations due to the financial isolation it’s suffering as a result of US economic sanctions.

Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist network that is largely funded by Iran. However, Iran is in the midst of a financial crisis due to harsh U.S. sanctions that have crippled its economy.

As a result, Iran has begun using cryptocurrencies and even started mining bitcoin to circumvent the sanctions.

To Congressman Brad Sherman, this is a clear-cut example of how crypto is being used by criminals to disempower American foreign policy.

Sherman: Crypto is mostly used by criminals

Sherman conceded that cryptocurrencies have legitimate purposes, but it “is singularly a benefit for those who wish to commit crime.” This is not the first time that Congressman Sherman has railed against crypto.

On May 3, Sherman slammed Facebook’s foray into crypto. He tweeted:

“Desperate to show it believes in privacy, Facebook will build a cryptocurrency platform to protect the privacy of drug dealers, tax evaders, and terrorists.” “The worldwide use of the U.S. dollar strengthens the U.S. economy and allows us to sanction rogue nations. Those desperate to weaken the U.S. pray for a crypto-alternative to the U.S. dollar.”

Many Trump officials are pro-crypto

For those who are politically aware, it’s not surprising that Congressman Sherman vehemently opposes cryptocurrencies. Many Democrats are, although there are some that are open-minded.

In contrast, Republicans — who are generally pro-business — are far more open to promoting entrepreneurial ventures. For example, Hester Peirce, one of five SEC commissioners, is so pro-bitcoin that she has been nicknamed “Crypto Mom” (an ironic moniker considering she has no children).

Peirce is a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump. Trump has a number of top aides that are pro-crypto, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.

Similarly, CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo has earned the title of “Crypto Dad” for his pro-bitcoin positions. Giancarlo is also a Republican.

Unfortunately for crypto fans, he’s retiring soon. But his presumptive replacement, Heath Tarbert, will probably be open-minded about crypto given Trump’s hiring track record.",2019-05-10 03:58:10+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-cryptocurrency-investors-are-renouncing-their-us-citizenship/,"Why Cryptocurrency Investors Are Renouncing Their US Citizenship

Andrew Henderson is the founder of Nomad Capitalist, a company which helps people from around the world move to different countries while minimizing their tax obligations. In recent years the company has created plans for dozens of people who made their wealth from the cryptocurrency sector, including business owners, traders, investors and consultants. News.Bitcoin.com interviewed Henderson to learn about the process and specifically how it relates to U.S. citizenship.

US Citizenship Is Costly and Toxic

What makes the plight of Americans stand out is that the U.S. applies its own taxation system on its citizens no matter where in the world they live, which includes its ever-changing rules in on cryptocurrencies. This is in contrast to most countries where taxes are linked to residency.

The Trump tax reform made the taxation of cryptocurrencies worse according to Henderson. So if you’re an American living overseas with crypto income you can’t pay zero taxes. “Basically, there is no way to escape tax if you’re in crypto. Even if you live outside of the US 365 days a year, you will probably pay a substantial amount of tax of your crypto,” he lamented. Obviously, some people in this situation will just not report their cryptocurrency earnings to the IRS, but that opens them up to legal problems.

Beyond the tax issues, U.S. citizens are also facing limitations on who they can work with due to companies’ fears of dealing with American regulations. In the crypto space there were many ICOs, for example, that banned U.S. citizens from investing, but some banks around the world are also banning U.S. citizens from opening accounts with them. “There’s a lot of financial institutions around the world that view US citizens as toxic, and I think that the US may make regulations more difficult for people in the future,” Henderson explained.

Where Do They Go and How Long Does It Take?

For people who want to sell as little of their crypto as possible, it makes sense to go with a citizenship by investment program, according to Henderson. “The Caribbean is generally good enough so there’s no need to go to Malta. Dominica, St Lucia, Antigua, are basically the cheapest ones. There are minor differences between them,” he explained. “There are many different passport options but I think that if you have any decent amount of crypto you should do citizenship by investment because you get the immediate effects and you reduce your opportunity cost.”

As for cryptocurrency investors selecting a new residency, it’s all over the map. Some people even become perpetual travelers, taking a Dominican passport and then traveling around the world. However, people generally want to go to a country that is tax-friendly. “What I recommend is the trifecta approach. My fiancé and I live in Malaysia for four months, we live in Montenegro for four months, four months somewhere else,” Henderson gave as an example.

People can get citizenship by investment, passport in hand, in about five to six months depending on how organized they are with the paperwork according to Henderson. His company’s cases process a little faster than people who do it on their own because Nomad Capitalist know how to fill out the large amount of paperwork involved. Going through naturalization can take two to five years.

How Much Do You Need to Make It Worth Renouncing Your US Citizenship?

Asked how much a person needs to have to make it worth the investment, Henderson replied: “Look at it as an insurance policy. How much you need to have before you take out more car insurance limit to avoid being sued if you hit somebody? It’s a personal decision. I think if you have a million dollars, you should have a second passport. If you don’t want to renounce to avoid the tax issues, you should at least find a country where you can work towards the second passport through naturalization.”

He also recommended people try applying for two or three of those countries to make sure that one or two come through. And if you’re paying $100K in tax, buying citizenship by investment will give you a 100% return on investment according to Henderson, in addition to freeing you from the system.

“The equation is different for everybody, there are some people who would say ‘Listen, I don’t care if I can save 10 million dollars, my US citizenship is worth more.’ No doubt, there are people in China, etc. who would pay 10 million dollars for US citizenship. That’s a personal discussion. My goal is: if I can make an ROI in six months or less, it’s worth it. If you look how much you’re going to save in the long run, you save the money every year, [and] you’re freeing yourself from what I call ‘a psycho ex-girlfriend’,” Henderson opined.

As for client reactions to being told they should renounce their citizenship, Henderson said it gave him a lesson on human behavior. “People, especially men, it’s hard for men to be vulnerable. They say ‘Yeah, I’ll renounce! Yeah, I’ll buy a passport!’ and then when they talk with the rest of the team who is about to help them proceed with the plan we hear: ‘Well, I’m concerned about it…’ When we say that renouncing is the best thing, most people get concerns or they delay the process. The problem is, you don’t know how it works until you do it, and once you do it – you can’t undo it.”

Speaking about the company’s future cryptocurrency plans, PayPal CFO John Rainey pointed out that the firm previously allowed its merchants to accept bitcoin (BTC) as a form of payment, but subsequently saw the instability and volatility of the currency. “If a merchant accepted that they would quickly convert it to a more stable currency like the euro or dollar,” Rainey stated, adding:

“We have teams clearly working on blockchain and cryptocurrency as well, and we want to participate in that in whatever form it takes in the future. I just think it’s a little early on right now.”

Rainey also revealed that PayPal made a $500 million worth investment in transportation network company Uber, because the two companies intend to jointly develop a payments platform.

In mid-April, PayPal won a cybersecurity patent for a system entitled “Techniques for cryptocurrency ransomware detection and mitigation,” that intends to improve the detection of ransomware and prevent it from locking up users’ access to their files.

Last year, PayPal filed another patent to increase the speed of cryptocurrency payments by using secondary private keys to reduce wait times for transactions between merchants and consumers. The patent details how the creation of secondary wallets with their own private keys will make transaction times much faster, “practically eliminat[ing] the amount of time the payee must wait to be sure they will receive a virtual currency payment in a virtual currency transaction.”",

“Significant” changes related to its application programming interface (API), two-factor authentication (2FA) and withdrawal validation are being made, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a blog post published on Friday.

The exchange did not disclose more details regarding these efforts, but said it is also improving its risk management and know-your-customer procedures to fight phishing, among other additional security measures at the back-end.

Binance will take action of some of the measures within this week and in the coming weeks in order to resume services at the earliest, according to the post. Zhao said tentatively, the exchange is looking to resume withdrawals and deposits “early next week.”

Binance will also be adding support for hardware-based 2FA devices such as YubiKey “very soon,” the CEO further said, adding that 1,000 YubiKeys will also be given away once the feature is live.

Binance first announced it had lost 7,000 bitcoin on Tuesday, saying hackers had gained access to user API keys and two-factor authentication codes, allowing them to withdraw bitcoin from one of the exchange’s hot wallets.

Immediately after discovering the breach, withdrawals and deposits were suspended, while trading was not affected. Binance said it would cover the loss for all impacted customers using its own emergency fund.

As of Wednesday, 2,500 of the stolen bitcoin had been shifted around and broken up into small amounts, a move that may be designed to obscure if and when the hacker decides to cash them out.

Crypto-oriented non-profit Coin Center tweeted the remarks of the congressman, a Democratic representative for California's 30th congressional district, on May 9.

In his comments, Rep. Sherman said that lawmakers must act preemptively to impede the threat posed by cryptocurrencies and thus outlaw their purchase by American citizens. Crypto’s threat, he claimed, forebodes no less than a shake-up of America’s geopolitical influence due to its potential diminishing of the power of its sovereign currency:

“An awful lot of our international power stems from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions [...] it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrencies to take that power away from us.”

To illustrate the dollar’s current hegemony, Sherman noted that in many key global markets such as oil, clearing via the New York Federal Reserve remains critical for major transactions.

The congressman continued to outline the purportedly negative impact of cryptocurrencies should they gain traction as a global unit of value, stating that an extra-national, distributed digital currency would:

“Put us in the position where the significant sanctions we have on Iran, for example, would become irrelevant.”

Sherman concluded by claiming that the end result of cryptocurrencies would be not only to disempower U.S. foreign policy, but also the country’s tax collection and traditional law enforcement — and thus to utterly transform both the domestic and the global status quo.

As reported, Sherman has previously called for a prohibition on U.S. citizens buying or mining cryptocurrencies. He has also remarked of the supporters of initial coin offerings that “charlatans and scammers have always favored decentralized new enterprises.”

In March 2018, he claimed that cryptocurrencies are a crock whose value lies in aiding terrorists and criminals.

Many of Sherman’s fellow lawmakers, however, take a distinctly more positive view of the promise of cryptocurrencies, with Congressman Darren Soto working on the advancement of three interrelated bills involving the promotion of blockchain.",,https://www.coindesk.com/as-bitcoin-continues-its-climb-top-altcoins-also-tease-breakout,"View

Bitcoin’s price hit fresh six-month high earlier today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,500 (100-week moving average).

BTC may witness a pullback to levels near $6,100 before rising toward that level, though, according to the hourly chart.

A bull flag breakout on the total market capitalization chart for all other cryptos, if confirmed, could be considered a sign the much-anticipated altcoin rally has begun.

Among those, litecoin could shine bright as both fundamentals and technicals have aligned in favor of the bulls.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) ascent continues with prices hitting new multi-month highs earlier today, and other top cryptocurrencies may soon join the party.

Bitcoin violated the resistance zone of $6,055–$6,100 with a UTC close at $6,156 on Thursday and reached a six-month high of $6,336 on Bitstamp at 07:40 UTC today.

Prices have now hit multi-month highs on three consecutive days – a sign of strong bullish sentiment. With every move higher, both the short- and long-term bull cases presented by several technical indicators over the last few weeks have gained strength.

BTC, therefore, appears on track to test the 100-week price average, currently at $6,506 – a level that last came into play last November.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,260 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.45 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

Daily and weekly charts

BTC continues to establish bullish higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart (above left) with key moving averages trending north.

The relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with above-70 reading. That signal, however, would gain credence if and when the momentum starts weakening. As of writing, the bulls are showing no signs of exhaustion.

Further, the weekly RSI (above right) is currently printing the strongest bullish signal in over 15 months.

Hourly chart

On the hourly chart, the RSI has breached the ascending trendline to the downside and is rolling over from overbought levels. Hence, we may see a minor pullback to the ascending trendline support, currently at $6,140, before rising toward $6,500.

Altcoins tease breakout

While bitcoin has doubled in value over the last six weeks, altcoins have underperformed big time, as indicated by the massive depreciation of their BTC-denominated exchange rates.

The top 10 altcoins by market capitalization (excluding stablecoin tether/USDT) are reporting double-digit losses on a 30-day basis.

Stellar (XLM), down 40 percent, is the biggest loser, followed by cardano (ADA) and tron (TRX).

With a 14 percent drop, Binance coin (BNB) is the best performing major altcoin.

The numbers indicate a lack of interest in altcoins despite BTC’s confirmation of the long-term bullish reversal on April 2.

The battered altcoins, however, could soon find some love, as their combined market capitalization seems to have charted a bullish technical pattern.

Total altcoin market capitalization

The bull flag seen in the above chart is a continuation pattern that often ends up accelerating the preceding rally.

A convincing break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $73.65 billion, would confirm a flag breakout and signal a continuation of the rise from lows near $45 billion seen in February.

A flag breakout, if confirmed, could be considered a sign the much-anticipated altcoin rally has begun. As of writing, the total altcoin market cap is seen at $72 billion.

Among the major altcoins, litecoin (LTC) could shine bright, as its mining reward halving is due in less than 90 days.

The process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing mining rewards by half every four years tends to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency for months in advance, according to historical data.

Litecoin daily chart

Litecoin’s channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. Prices, therefore, could rise above $100 ahead of the reward halving event.

The banking committee wrote an open letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg Thursday, asking him to share details about its secret cryptocurrency project, with a particular focus on consumer privacy.

“Last year, Facebook asked U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about consumers,” the letter says:

“In addition, privacy experts have raised questions about Facebook’s extensive data collection practices and whether any of the data collected by Facebook is being used for purposes that do or should subject Facebook to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.”

In light of these concerns, the committee wants Zuckerberg to outline how the Facebook cryptocurrency, referred to under the codename of “Project Libra,” would work; what outreach Facebook has done to financial regulators; and what users can expect in terms of privacy and consumer protection.

More broadly, the committee has asked Facebook to share what consumer financial information has been shared by banks and other financial institutions; what Facebook does with that information (including whether that information is shared or sold to other third parties); whether Facebook has credit rating and other personal information about individuals; and how Facebook avoids violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Little is known about Project Libra. The company quietly began building up a blockchain research team last year, headed up by vice president and former Coinbase board member David Marcus.

The company has posted numerous job listings for the team since, and notable figures in the space such as crypto economist Christian Catalini, a researcher with MIT, have also joined the project.

The company is reportedly looking to raise as much as $1 billion for the project to use as collateral to back a stablecoin.

Another Indian cryptocurrency exchange is downing its shutters.

Coinome, backed by the online payment gateway Billdesk, announced yesterday (May 09) that it will be halting operations from May 15. However, it remains unclear if the company plans to exit the Indian market completely or has only temporarily shut shop.

Recent regulatory changes introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a lack of policy clarity from the government, and a consequent slowdown in trading volumes, are believed to be the reasons behind Coinome’s move.

“India is currently going through uncertainty on crypto guidelines and regulations. The government of India has not yet taken a decision on the regulatory framework for crypto exchanges or wallets. Further, the supreme court is yet to act upon the public interest litigation (PIL) on (the) regulation of cryptoassets,” the exchange informed its customers in an email, a copy of which has been accessed by Quartz.

Coinome is not the only exchange to be stifled by the regulatory environment.

In September 2018, Zebpay, then the biggest cryptoexchange in India, had created shockwaves by announcing the closure of its Indian operations. In March, Coindelta announced its plans to fold its business saying it is no longer viable.

Downhill

In April 2018, India’s central bank barred all bourses and virtual currency traders from maintaining a bank account or having any business relationship with lenders from July that year. This slammed the brakes on the flourishing virtual currency ecosystem.

Hit by the decision, cryptocurrency firms then dragged the RBI and the Indian government to the country’s top court. The final hearing of the case commenced in September last year but till now there is no resolution in sight.

“A lot of people were expecting that the hearing in March will provide some clarity as the government had been asked to bring about a regulation in four weeks but nothing happened,” said the owner of another struggling virtual currency exchange, under the condition of anonymity. “A lot of players are beginning to lose hope.”

A high-level panel was constituted by the Indian government in 2017 to come up with guidelines for the crypto currency ecosystem. Led by the top bureaucrat Subhash Chandra Garg, it has representatives from the RBI and the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

A recent report, which suggested that this committee is looking at a complete ban of cryptocoins, had spooked the market. Now, it is likely that any clarity will emerge only after the results of India’s ongoing general elections are announced on May 23.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-generate-qr-codes-for-crypto-payments/,"How to Generate QR Codes for Crypto Payments

Ripple, market maker Cumberland, Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Holdings and over 30 other firms met at a recent round-table event in Chicago for the initiative, Bloomberg reported.

During the event, the creation of a list of entities involved, directly or indirectly, in illicit activities was considered, as well as giving companies with a good reputation some form of accreditation.

A community-wide effort to improve compliance standards would prevent liabilities that might stem from trading with bad actors or dealers that trade with bad actors""

Other options considered included standards to verify the identities of customers, and sharing information on those who default on derivatives trades. The event, organized by Crypto OTC Roundtable Asia (CORA) didn't see the firms reach a final decision. CORA is set to meet again in the near future.

""A community-wide effort to improve compliance standards would prevent liabilities that might stem from trading with bad actors or dealers that trade with bad actors,"" Darius Sit, managing partner at Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, told Bloomberg. ""A self-governance initiative like this is also something that regulators are keen to see.""

While the decade-old crypto market has attracted top technologists and developers, as well as a flock of former Wall Street traders, it has also been a magnet for scammers and criminals. As if to make the point, at the same time as the crypto traders were meeting in Chicago, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, discovered hackers had stolen 7,000 bitcoins worth about $40m, which briefly sent the digital-token market down about 3%, before it recovered.

Blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace recently estimated that losses arising from cryptocurrency hacks and fraud may have already reached about $1.2bn in the first quarter of this year alone (a number that includes Bitfinex's allegedly missing $850m). The figure is almost 71% of the $1.7bn loss seen over the whole of 2018, the firm said.

Crypto Twitter (CT) is a grueling battleground between digital currency enthusiasts, company executives, maximalists, journalists, lawyers, and so-called thought leaders and luminaries. For instance, on May 8, reporter Larry Cermak posted data concerning Blockstream and its sidechain project Liquid’s performance over the last seven months. After Cermak shared unbiased figures and queried an alleged conflict of interest, the Blockstream account instantly blocked the journalist.

Liquid’s Lack of Traction Sparks Intense Crypto Twitter Debate

CT is a wonderful place so long as you toe the maximalist party line, sing kumbaya, and tell everyone how great BTC is on a daily basis. Because if you don’t repeat these values, you just might be designated persona non grata. This week on CT, the founding partner at Adamant Capital, Tuur Demeester, tweeted about Blockstream’s latest Liquid announcement and said the sidechain “could become a DTCC for Bitcoin.” In response, The Block analyst Larry Cermak shared data concerning Liquid’s overall performance in the last seven months.

“So far, in its 7-month history, Blockstream is barely gaining any traction,” Cermak replied. “Liquid has had 61,700 total transactions and is currently capitalized with $313,000 from the net value of less than 400 peg transactions.”

Demeester responded: “Let’s wait until tx fees on the main chain spike again.” The following day, after Cermak posted his tidbit of publicly available data, he found out he was blocked by the official Blockstream Twitter account. “This is pretty pathetic — Yesterday, I posted data that showed that Blockstream’s Liquid isn’t doing well (so far) after being live for 7 months,” Cermak tweeted. “Literally I just posted publicly available data and I got blocked by Blockstream’s official account.” Blockstream’s chief strategy officer, Samson Mow, claimed he was the one who blocked Cermak “because he’s a moron.”

Questioning a Conflict of Interest Apparently Makes a Reporter a Moron

So did Blockstream decide to block an analyst for posting data? Well according to Blockstream employees it was really because Cermak publicly asked if there was a conflict of interest between Blockstream, Adam Back, and Samson Mow sticking up for Bitfinex.

“Why are we not talking about Adam Back and Samson Mow, two of the most visible employees of Blockstream publicly siding with Bitfinex given that Bitfinex is an early investor in Blockstream?” asked Cermak. “The conflicts of interest in this space are something else” The Block analyst continued, adding:

What’s the issue with this, some are asking? — And at this point, it seems that the only people siding with Bitfinex and Tether are shareholders or somewhat involved.

The Block’s Frank Chaparro asked why simply asking a question brought out all the pitchforks. Blockstream’s Adam Back replied that “It happens to be untrue, however, which I confirmed for another journalist who asked privately about the claim.” Back continued by stating: “Simply the quote ‘It’s because Bitfinex invested in Blockstream’ is untrue, and did not fact check. You don’t have to fact check, but stating as fact untrue allegations is not that cool.” Back seems to think Cermak should have asked people FUDing Bitfinex, and that his defending of Tether was simply him just refuting “publicly known FUD as a public service.”

The story continued as maximalists decided to harass The Block for accepting $25K in funding and allegedly not reporting on Coinbase objectively in an attempt to flip the story back on the publication. However, after defending the news outlet, The Block CEO Mike Dudas disclosed that the company would return the funds to Coinbase. Quite a few crypto supporters thought that Blockstream was wrong for getting upset with Cermak’s objective data and his valid question. After all, a good number of people on CT have already been questioning Blockstream’s seeming conflict of interest.

Moreover, the anonymous owner of Bitcoin.org, Cobra, detailed that he was also blocked by Blockstream for questioning them. He remarked that when Coinbase and Bitmain were catching flak from the community they never blocked people and he insisted that members of “Blockstream are delicate snowflakes.” Cobra is also known for questioning Blockstream when Back showed support for Halong Miners, a startup accused of simply buying Innosilicon miners and applying Halong stickers on them for resale.

The thought police on CT are starting to look no different than the pigs in the famous Orwell novel Animal Farm. The social media platform is filled with teenage angst, confirmation bias, and groupthink, and is no different to the archetypal high school groups that thrive on immaturity and bullying.

Cryptocurrency markets have been doing extremely well over the last 48 hours, making a lot of prior skeptics think the bearish crypto winter may have ended. Since our last markets update three days ago, the entire cryptoconomy has gained close to $33 billion in value and trading sessions over the last 24 hours produced a whopping $81 billion in global trades.

The Top Cryptocurrencies by Market Cap

Last week, the community dealt with the Binance loss of over $40 million (7,000 BTC) and the whole cryptoconomy tumbled in value for a short period of time. During our last markets update, we reported on how crypto prices regained their losses and continued their bullish trajectories upwards. Today on May 11, the ecosystem is doing far better than most expected with an overall market capitalization of around $210 billion. In addition to the increased value, global trade volume has increased by over $25 billion since last Wednesday.

At the moment, the market price of bitcoin core (BTC) is roughly $6,921 and the currency is up 7.9% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) markets are up 11.5% today and each token is trading for $195. The third highest market valuation is ripple (XRP) which is trading for $0.32 per coin. Lastly, the forerunner out of the top five coins is litecoin (LTC) at $88 per LTC as the currency’s gained 16.7%.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

Bitcoin cash is up this Saturday by 15.9% and over 18% for the last seven days. BCH has an overall market valuation of around $5.9 billion and about $2.8 billion in 24-hour trade volume. The decentralized currency is the sixth most traded coin globally below eos and above ripple. The top exchanges swapping the most bitcoin cash today include Lbank, Coinbene, P2pb2b, Digifinex, and Bitmart. The currency pair traded with the BCH the most today is tether (USDT), at 49.3%. This is followed by BTC (33.1%), USD (6.9%), KRW (5.9%), and JPY (1.6%). Both ethereum and the euro capture a little more than 1% of today’s BCH global trade volume as well.

BCH/USD Technical Indicators

Looking at the 4-hour BCH/USD chart on Kraken shows bulls have blown past major resistance at the $300 region and prices are hovering around $335 per unit at press time. Most moving averages are indicating strong bullish signals with the two long and short term Simple Moving Averages (SMA) spreading. At the moment, the short-term 100 SMA is well above the longer term 200 SMA trendline indicating the path toward the least resistance is still the upside.

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions on the 4-hour chart and the Stochastic is impartial. With the price blazing through new territories, there could be a slight pullback after the peak. The MACd shows a bullish crossover has taken place while the Average Directional Index is neutral at the moment. BCH/USD order books show some stronger resistance levels from the current vantage point all the way to the $360 range. On the backside, there’s some consolidated support levels between $320 to the $300 zone.

The Verdict: Optimism Outstrips Pessimism

So far cryptocurrencies have done extremely well in 2019, outpacing popular commodities like gold and top performing stocks as well. A large portion of the top cryptocurrencies have gained 50% or more year-to-date. Vinny Lingham has stated that if BTC can hold above the $6,200 range for 24-48 hours he will believe the bear market is over.

BCH has done amazingly well over the last two months and has surged in value significantly. The Bitcoin Cash protocol will soon be upgraded, gaining Schnorr signatures adding more attributes to the network such as scaling and privacy. While there are some who still believe the bear market might not be over, lately it’s been hard for even the staunchest of cynics not to feel a little bullish.

Reuters reported the news on May 10.

Per the report, the California Superior Court last week ordered Manhattan resident Truglia to pay the amount above in compensatory and punitive damages. The amount is reportedly one of the largest court judgments awarded to an individual in the crypto space thus far, Reuters notes.

As previously reported, Terpin filed the complaint against Truglia in particular in late December, after first filing a lawsuit against AT&T last August. Terpin accused the firm of negligence that allegedly allowed the suspect to gain control over Terpin’s phone number and steal almost $24 million worth of crypto.

Truglia and other participants allegedly took control over Terpin’s tokens by transferring his phone number under their control, resetting passwords and accessing his online accounts. Truglia was reportedly arrested in November for stealing $1 million in crypto also via SIM swapping.

According to Satoshi’s Treasure co-creator Eric Meltzer of Primitive Ventures, so far nearly 60,000 people have signed up for notifications related to the international scavenger hunt for $1 million worth of bitcoin.

On Saturday, at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York, Melzter and the team revealed yet another clue: A series of cryptic images and other hints hidden on business cards distributed at the event.

And, as revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, a group of veteran crypto investors have pledged an undisclosed amount to fund future games and campaigns. These sponsors include Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Pincus, Andrew Lee, IDEO CoLabs Ventures, Nic Carter, Matt Walsh, Meltem Demirors, Li Xiaolai, Jehan Chu and Sam Engelbardt.

“I’d say Satoshi’s Treasure is so exciting because it’s the pure joy of a treasure hunt,” Carter told CoinDesk. “It’s global and anyone can participate.”

Meanwhile, many have formed online teams to collect the 400 key fragments required to move the prize from the game’s bitcoin wallet, Meltzer said. Yet even the dynamics of these teams highlight how bitcoiners are unique compared to other online gaming communities. For example, software engineer John Cantrell cracked the code for one of the first key fragments then promptly detailed on both Twitter and GitHub how he managed to do it.

“For me, it’s really all about education,” Cantrell told CoinDesk.

Since then, Cantrell also joined several teams and created a free tool called Ordo to help teams organize clues and fairly credit contributions to the hunt, which will come in handy for any winning team looking to divvy up the loot.

Cantrell said so far the largest team using Ordo appears to have 600 members.

Another large team, called the Magellan Clan, told CoinDesk via email it has 100 members from 30 countries. It even made a unique token to reward people beyond the team who provide tips.

With so many players flocking to Satoshi’s Treasure, Cantrell isn’t the only one making tools and services for other players.

The 18-person ToshiCiphers clan, for example, has launched a merchandise store for teams looking to make shirts and other swag. ToshiCiphers clan member Devon Kramer told CoinDesk they’ve had four orders for custom shirts so far.

While many players in this game were, like Cantrell, already bitcoin veterans, some gamers have been attracted to Satoshi’s Treasure by the collaborative play, rather than the prize itself. Clues are spread both around the physical world and online, requiring a wide range of skills and languages for teams to be competitive.

“We have a couple of people who are new to cryptocurrency, didn’t know much about blockchain, but they were brought in by the hunt,” Kramer said.

Kramer’s teammate, who goes by Yann, added:

“I think we are playing the first Great game of the Augmented Reality Era.”

The Indian crypto community is undeterred by the widespread rumor that its government is discussing a bill which could ban some cryptocurrencies. Local crypto exchanges have revealed to news.Bitcoin.com that their trading volumes have been increasing despite this report. Meanwhile, experts have weighed in on this possible bill, and another crypto exchange may be shutting down due to the banking restriction by the central bank.

Unwavering Growth

The media recently reported that the Indian government has kicked off an interministerial discussion on a bill entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019.” The news spread like wildfire as many media outlets covered the story; some are calling it FUD while others are treating it as a fact.

Indian crypto traders seem undeterred by this news. The CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, Nischal Shetty, shared with news.Bitcoin.com:

The report did not really affect volumes at all … Unless we hear something concrete from our finance department I don’t think it’s going to affect existing traders.

The CEO added that his exchange “saw the highest trading volume in April where we crossed over $11M in trading.” Noting that “We have seen such similar news come out in October 2018,” he emphasized that “Basically no more FUD is being created by such media news. Everyone is waiting for concrete info to come from the government.”

Another local crypto exchange shares a similar sentiment. Instashift’s Jacob Mani told news.Bitcoin.com that “The reports about the ban haven’t deterred anyone.” He elaborated, “Since Koinex had been on maintenance for a few days we have been seeing more volumes,” confirming:

The activities keep on increasing day by day.

Dismissing the Ban Rumor

Varun Sethi, founder of Blockchain Lawyer, shared some thoughts on the “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill” with news.Bitcoin.com. He commented:

My preliminary thoughts are that the bill is too far from reaching discussion at the upper or lower house of Parliament in India. The media seems to be cooking up news.

This is not the first time reports of a ban have been blown out of proportion, but the government has yet to offer any sort of confirmation. In December last year, anonymous sources told CNBC TV18 that “The panel has suggested that a new legal framework within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines should be brought in to ban cryptocurrencies and the law should clearly specify that any kind of dealing in such currencies should be treated as illegal.”

A few weeks later, a different media outlet quoted an unnamed government official as saying: “There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalized with strong riders. Deliberations are on. We will have more clarity soon.”

Ajeet Khurana, CEO of crypto exchange Zebpay, shared his thoughts on the matter with Micky news outlet Wednesday. “I have talked to all of the top stakeholders in the Ministry of Finance, the central bank, the securities regulator and despite them having a certain amount misgiving around crypto I have never heard them talk of banning it,” he described, elaborating:

So it’s very interesting that the people who could ban it have never said they will ban it.

Crypto Asset Regulators in India

An interministerial committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, is responsible for drafting the country’s crypto regulation. The committee includes representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the Central Board of Direct Taxes.

However, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published a directory of crypto asset regulators for all of its member countries last month, listing the RBI as the only regulator for crypto assets in India. The FSB is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. Currently, the “RBI does not have a legal mandate to directly regulate crypto-assets,” the board explained. “RBI’s current mandate permits it to assess financial institutions’ exposure to crypto-assets and supervise their operations.”

Within its mandate, the RBI issued the infamous circular in April last year prohibiting regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The restriction went into effect in July.

However, the central bank never did any research before issuing this circular as evident in its reply to a Right to Information (RTI) request filed by Sethi soon after the circular was issued. The lawyer asked the central bank what research it had done before issuing this restriction. “The RBI specifically mentions that it conducted no research or consultation before the implementation of [the] restriction in April. The RBI also responded that no committee was ever formed for analyzing the concept of blockchain before the decision,” the Economic Times quoted Sethi as saying.

Victims of RBI’s Action

The banking restriction has crippled many crypto businesses, particularly exchanges which had to stop allowing their users to deposit and withdraw INR from bank accounts. Coinome, an Indian crypto exchange backed by online payment gateway Billdesk, may have become the latest exchange to fall victim to the lack of regulation. “All crypto markets on Coinome will be suspended, effective 2pm on May 15th, 2019. Customers are requested to withdraw all their crypto assets from Coinome at the earliest,” the exchange announced Thursday.

Coinome also sent an email to its customers explaining the situation, which Quartz claims to have seen. According to the news outlet, the email notes that “the supreme court is yet to act upon the public interest litigation (PIL) on (the) regulation of cryptoassets,” adding:

India is currently going through uncertainty on crypto guidelines and regulations. The government of India has not yet taken a decision on the regulatory framework for crypto exchanges or wallets.

Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, was the first major exchange to shut down its trading operations in the country due to the banking restriction. After exiting India in September last year, the exchange expanded abroad, with the most recent launch being in Australia. A smaller crypto exchange, Coindelta, announced its shutdown in March after the supreme court decided to postpone hearing the crypto case to July.

Moreover, the Economic Times reported last month that another major crypto exchange in India, Unocoin, had laid off most of its staff. The exchange scaled down its team from over 100 people in February to just 14 employees. “We did ask people to leave last week, but our operations will continue for the foreseeable future. We have some amount of reserves to push through for the next couple of months and will wait for the supreme court’s verdict,” CEO Sathvik Vishwanath told the publication. Unocoin also tried launching a cash kiosk in October last year in an effort to allow its users access to INR after the banking restriction took effect. However, it ran into trouble with law enforcement which led to the arrest of two of its founders including Vishwanath.

Indian Crypto Regulation on the Horizon

India’s legal framework for cryptocurrencies was supposed to be ready in July last year but has continually been postponed. The Garg committee has received many suggestions for the regulation. “Various options for treating virtual currencies and crypto assets including banning/regulating are being examined by the committee,” the Ministry of Finance wrote in its summary report of the Indian government’s 2018 activities published in March. No further official announcement has been made regarding crypto regulation.

Further, the Indian government will also be participating in the G20 summit in June where crypto regulations and global standards for crypto assets will be discussed among the G20 countries and global standard-setting organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). India’s Department of Revenue has been working with the FATF to establish global crypto standards, the Ministry of Finance has previously revealed.

For now, Indian crypto businesses and enthusiasts are waiting for the supreme court, which will resume hearing the crypto case on July 23. The court is expected to hear about the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies from the government as well as address the banking restriction by the central bank. In the meantime, several existing laws in India could already apply to crypto assets.

On Thursday (May 9, 2019), the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published new guidelines showing how anti-money laundering (AML) laws apply to Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency in general.

Mandatory KYC for P2P Bitcoin Trading Platforms

In a tweet published on Friday (May 10, 2019) notable cryptocurrency legal expert Jake Chervinsky provided a summary examination of the key highlights from the FinCEN guidelines.

The main purpose of the 30-page document is to provide regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency businesses in determining whether they are money transmitters under the Banking Secrecy Act (BSA).

0/ A few important points from FinCEN's recent guidance on how the anti-money laundering (AML) laws apply to the crypto industry. Let's talk about the winners, the losers, and all the others caught in between. Thread 👇 — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) May 10, 2019

According to FinCEN, Bitcoin peer-to-peer trading platforms like Localbitcoins are money transmitters. The regulatory watchdog characterized P2P exchanges as entities engaged in trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Thus, BTC traders on Localbitcoins who have dealings in the U.S. must perform mandatory know-your-customer (KYC) processes and abide by AML laws. This guideline also means unlicensed BTC P2P traders risk facing jail time if caught.

Back in 2018, Eldon Ross, a Pennsylvania native bagged a one-year prison sentence for running an unlicensed money transmission business (MSB) using BTC.

Pivot Towards STOs?

Another potential element of the new FinCEN guidance is as it relates to initial coin offerings (ICOs). For the longest time, many projects have tried to pass-up their offerings as utility tokens to avoid securities regulations but that could change.

Reading the new FinCEN guidance. Mark this prediction in your calendars: The same investors and crypto lawyers who desperately wanted utility tokens to never be securities are going to be begging for them to be securities so that they can avoid being money. 😂 — Gabriel Shapiro (@lex_node) May 9, 2019

According to Chervinksy, the new FinCEN guidance characterizes ICOs as money transmitters when the tokens offered aren’t securities. An excerpt from the document reads:

The seller of the CVC [Convertible Virtual Currency] is a money transmitter, acting in the role of administrator, because at the time of the initial offering the seller is the only person authorized to issue and redeem (permanently retire from circulation) the new units of CVC.

DEXes and DApps on Opposite Side of FinCEN’s Guideline

While the FinCEN document appears well-reasoned and firmly neutral as far cryptocurrency regulations go, there is, however, a bit of internal inconsistency.

This discrepancy applies to the mixed characterization of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and decentralized applications (DApps.)

It appears FinCEN doesn’t quite accurately grasp the fact that a DEX is a type of DApp. In the document, the financial crimes watchdog says DApps can qualify as money transmitters, if:

the DApp performs money transmission, the definition of money transmitter will apply to the DApp, the owners/operators of the DApp, or both.

However, the same guideline explicitly states that DEX (likely non-custodial exchanges) are exempted from money transmission laws.

",2019-05-11 19:00:25+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/11/5-things-to-know-facebook-cryptocurrency-ambition.aspx,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is building a cryptocurrency payment platform for its social network, according to The Wall Street Journal. The platform, codenamed Project Libra, will reportedly let users use digital coins to make purchases on Facebook and third-party sites.

This isn't the first time we've heard about Facebook's cryptocurrency ambitions. In late 2018, it tested out an internally developed cryptocurrency for peer-to-peer money transfers on WhatsApp in India. In February, The New York Times claimed that Facebook was ""hoping to succeed where bitcoin failed,"" and that the unification of WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram's messaging platforms could enable crypto payments across all three platforms.

Here are five new things investors should know about Facebook's push into the crypto market.

1. It will use ""stablecoins""

Facebook's cryptocurrency will reportedly be a ""stablecoin."" Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar or a commodity (like gold) to minimize volatility. That's a smart move, since the prices of many other cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin and ethereum) fluctuate wildly. The price of bitcoin, for example, bounced between nearly $14,000 in late 2017 and about $3,000 at the beginning of this year. That volatile price might make it attractive to traders, but it also makes it impractical for traditional payments.

2. It could challenge PayPal, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Square

Facebook finished last quarter with 2.38 billion monthly active users. If it launches a unified currency for all those users, its coin could theoretically become the most widely used currency in the world. If Facebook tethers more third-party websites, apps, and stores to that platform, it could challenge payment platforms like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Pay, Alphabet's Google Pay, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pay, and Square (NYSE:SQ).

David Marcus, PayPal's former president, currently leads Facebook's blockchain group (which is developing the cryptocurrency), and about 20% of the unit's 50 employees came from PayPal. That reunion suggests that Facebook plans to leverage its massive network of users to disrupt the market for online payments.

3. It would complement the company's other e-commerce ambitions

A ""Facebook coin"" could tie together the company's fragmented payment and e-commerce efforts, which include peer-to-peer payments on Messenger, in-app checkouts for purchases on Instagram, interactive live videos that let merchants sell their products, and the Craigslist-like Facebook Marketplace.

Facebook only offers these services in select markets, but launching a single currency for all its users worldwide could expand their reach and form the foundations of a stable e-commerce ecosystem. Facebook could also nurture the growth of its payments service by charging transaction fees or adding a slight margin to its coin purchases.

If that business grew, it would reduce Facebook's dependence on ads by boosting the weight of its oft-overlooked ""payments and other fees"" business. That segment generated just $165 million in revenue (1% of its top line) last quarter.

4. It could pay its users and offer merchants discounts

Facebook could reportedly reward users with crypto coins for viewing ads, or distribute them as loyalty points for interacting with content or buying products across its platforms.

This strategy would be similar to Amazon's offer of free ""Amazon Coins"" for users who purchased certain Android apps, games, or in-game items. However, the Amazon Coin isn't a blockchain-powered cryptocurrency -- it's a simple virtual currency with a fixed value of $5 per coin.

Facebook could also reward merchants for accepting more Facebook coin payments. For example, if a user clicks through a Facebook ad and completes a purchase with the coins, the retailer can use those coins to buy additional ads at a discount.

5. Visa and Mastercard might be interested

Facebook's plans could potentially disrupt traditional credit card companies like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). However, Facebook is reportedly in talks with both companies, which might want to become investors -- or even partners -- in the platform.

That's logical, because Facebook would need a physical debit card partner to expand into brick-and-mortar stores. PayPal partnered with Visa to offer a physical debit card, and Square forged a similar partnership with Mastercard. Apple also recently introduced the physical Apple Card to expand Apple Pay into more stores.

A promising plan, but plenty of hurdles

Facebook's plan still faces lots of hurdles. For instance, established platforms like PayPal have a big lead, and Amazon and Google both struggled to catch up. Apple fared better thanks to its loyal base of hardware users, but it still controls a smaller slice of the market than PayPal. Facebook's reputation, which was tarnished by privacy and security debacles over the past year, could also prevent users from adopting its cryptocurrency offering.

Facebook's plan sounds promising, but investors shouldn't count on it to reduce the company's dependence on advertising revenue anytime soon.",2019-05-11,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-hits-8-month-high-close-to-7k,"View

Bitcoin printed an eight-month high of $6,964 earlier today. Further strengthening the long-term bullish bias is a bull cross of the 100- and 200-day moving averages (MAs) – the first since July 2015.

A sustained move toward the next resistance at $7,411 (September 2018 high) could be preceded by a price pullback, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is currently reporting overbought conditions.

Pullbacks, if any, will likely be reversed by the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $5,450.

The long-term bullish outlook would be invalidated only below the 200-day MA at $4,405.

There seems to be no stopping the bitcoin (BTC) freight train.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $6,964 at 06:00 UTC today on Bitstamp, the highest level since Sept. 5, 2018, having found acceptance above the crucial 200-week moving average at $6,500 in early Asian trading hours.

Prices have set a new multi-month high for the fourth straight day and have rallied in excess of over 70 percent in the last 5.5-weeks.

Notably, with the sharp rally, the 100-day MA of bitcoin’s price has moved above the 200-day MA. That is the first bullish crossover between the two averages since July 2015.

The development further confirms the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by several technical indicators, including a golden crossover, over the last few weeks.

The moving average studies, however, are lagging indicators and have limited predictive abilities, as they take old price history into account.

Even so, investors may take heart as a similar crossover in July 2015 was followed by a 2.5-year bull run.

Daily chart

The 100-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA from below (see above left). The latest bullish crossover comes two weeks after the confirmation of a golden crossover of the 50- and 200-day MAs.

The last bull cross of the 100- and 200-day MAs (above right), confirmed on July 26, 2015, remained valid for 33 months, during which the price rallied 8,000 percent to a record high of $20,000.

With the next mining reward halving due in May 2020, the doors seem open for BTC rise further over the long-term.

The short-term outlook is also bullish. The 30-day MA is trending north with the price creating bullish higher highs and higher lows. BTC, therefore, looks set to extend the rally to the next resistance level at $7,400.

A pullback, however, may precede the next leg higher or the gains above $7,000 may not be sustainable in the short-term, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting extreme overbought conditions.

Also, it’s worth noting that BTC suffered a temporary price pullback from $290 to $220 in the four weeks following the bull cross in July 2015 before picking a strong bid.

That said, with the long-term technicals biased bullish, the historically strong support of the 30-day MA, currently at $5,463, could again reverse deeper price pullbacks, if any.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,800, representing a 7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

Since the creation of Bitcoin, there has only ever been one cryptocurrency at the top of the market cap rankings, despite thousands of competitors being created over the years.

The Bitcoin price defines all other cryptocurrencies. Indeed, altcoins are not only priced in dollar terms, but also in terms of satoshis – their worth in Bitcoin. But why is it that the Bitcoin price defines the cryptocurrency market?

Bitcoin price dominance

When looking at the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has always maintained its dominance. While this dominance has shrunk in recent years, even to this day, and despite challenges from all corners of the market, Bitcoin’s dominance of the market remains above 50%.

When the price of Bitcoin rises, generally you can expect altcoin prices to rise with it. Likewise, when the Bitcoin price drops, altcoins also follow. There may be some lag in-between, but the coupling of Bitcoin to altcoins is one that is yet to be truly broken.

The reasons for Bitcoin’s dominance are numerous. To begin with, Bitcoin has had the first-mover advantage over its competitors. Thanks to this, even people who are not interested in cryptocurrency have still usually heard of Bitcoin.

This makes it all the more likely that the first cryptocurrency that newcomers purchase will be Bitcoin as well. On top of this, despite efforts from a variety of communities, there hasn’t been any conclusive evidence that there is a better cryptocurrency out there other than Bitcoin.

People might point to Bitcoin’s slower transaction speed or wasteful Proof-of-Work mechanism, but the core tenants of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – namely decentralisation and global money – are still prevalent today.

Practically all cryptocurrencies remain untested and have complex goals. Ethereum and other smart contract platforms have yet to see fully successful projects built on top and are still very much experimental.

Story continues

Arguments still continue to this day over the possible use cases of blockchain. They are generally split into two camps: those who believe that a blockchain has a fairly limited use case, in essence only useful for monetary transfer such as Bitcoin, and others who claim that blockchain will be a revolutionary piece of technology akin to the internet.

Bitcoin has through the years though shown that not only is there a market for itself, but that it provides real-world value.

Competitors through history

The biggest challenger to Bitcoin’s dominance has been Ethereum. The concept that Bitcoin might lose its throne became known as “The Flippening” during 2017 when the dominance of Bitcoin looked set for a challenge.

There were a couple of reasons for this challenge appearing. Firstly, the hype surrounding Ethereum gave the cryptocurrency huge momentum. The ICO craze of 2017 was driving the price of Ethereum ever higher. At the same time, Bitcoin was in the midst of its scaling wars. With a bloated blockchain and no sign of peace, Ethereum was able to make substantial ground on Bitcoin’s throne.

Despite “The Flippening” generating plenty of interest, it never actually materialised. Once Bitcoin resolved the scaling issues that were plaguing the community, its dominance soon strengthened. However, it hasn’t reached the dominance it once had.

Scaling issues are still a problem for Bitcoin, and these issues are affecting the Ethereum blockchain as well. Updates are needed for Ethereum to deal with what is essentially a bloated blockchain.

Roger Ver has long described Bitcoin Cash as the true Bitcoin. Despite his commitment, the price of Bitcoin Cash has never come close to flippening Bitcoin. But Ver still maintains that Bitcoin Cash will one day dominate the scene. It should be noted that Ver also once said he anticipates Ethereum overtaking the Bitcoin price.

Ver believes that Bitcoin’s dominance has dropped due to the issues of scaling and the price of Bitcoin transactions rising. This is why he believes people have started to investigate altcoins.

Recent price action has shown Bitcoin dominating altcoins, pushing their price further down. The last altseason peaked when Bitcoin had topped out and retail buyers flooded into altcoins to try and maximise their profit. Many bagholders have since been left with some altcoins looking dead in the water.

The issue for competitors of Bitcoin is that if there is interesting technology on their cryptocurrency, then Bitcoin can look to incorporate the code into Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin can evolve to compete, and it would take something extraordinary for another cryptocurrency to displace Bitcoin.

Conclusion

Bitcoin is one of the only cryptocurrencies to provide a real-world use case and utility. Many other cryptocurrencies are more akin to experiments taking place on a blockchain.

For the foreseeable future, expect to see Bitcoin as the dominant market in the cryptocurrency industry. Should interesting developments arrive on altcoins, the likelihood is that Bitcoin will evolve with the times anyway as it has done so in the past.

The post Why the Bitcoin price defines the cryptocurrency market appeared first on Coin Rivet.",,https://cryptobriefing.com/novogratz-bitcoin-ethereum-overtake-bitcoin/,"Share this article

Bitcoin and Mike Novogratz go together like peanut butter and jelly: but to the surprise of many, the bullish prognosticator has now suggested that Ethereum is likely to dominate the sphere of online payments.

In a keynote speech at the Ethereal Summit, the founder of Galaxy Digital Capital emphasized that the second-largest cryptocurrency has the potential to dominate Web 3.0, and may eclipse Bitcoin as the most valuable blockchain network.

“There’s good news and bad news” for Ethereum investors, Novogratz said. “The good news is that Ethereum is way ahead,” he said, noting the enormous number of developers and companies building on the smart contracts platform. “Ethereum, by a long shot, has the most people in the room.”

This, he said, would be a formidable advantage over competitors like Cosmos or Polkadot, which may soon launch with more advanced technology but will be far behind in terms of adoption interest. “What we looked at as investors, and what I stress, is that it only works if there are people in the room.”

Litecoin, for example, has a “very vibrant community,” according to Novogratz. “But it’s a community of speculators,” he said. “There’s no one building anything on the Litecoin blockchain.”

“ To me,” he added, Litecoin has “no future. “

Bitcoin Will Likely Lead For a Long Time

Although Ethereum may eventually eclipse Bitcoin as the most valuable digital asset, Novogratz highlighted that Bitcoin will continue to lead as the de facto cryptocurrency for some time. “Bitcoin is really establishing itself as a store of value,” he said. “The debate is over. We won.”

This would likely cement Bitcoin’s short- to mid-term lead as the leading cryptocurrency, and its utility as a store of value. “I see the on-ramps for institutions who now believe its a store of value who are coming in,” Novogratz said. “Bitcoin is going to stay for a while because that’s where the institutions are going to start.”

However, Novogratz predicted that Bitcoin’s store-of-value properties would eventually be eclipsed by smart contracts and decentralized applications. “The really cool stuff is Web 3.0,” he said. “That’s the revolution in a lot of ways.”

Government Currencies Are Coming

Online payments present a “phenomenally important” opportunity for blockchain technology, Novogratz added, saying they would provide an important alternative to state-controlled currencies.

“95% of financial transactions in China happen on a phone. Those transactions go through a government clearinghouse,” he added, which “gets plugged into big brother’s machine-learning AI. So they know what you’re thinking and how you behave.”

Along with facial recognition and big data analysis, these data are used to restrict Chinese citizens according to their social responsibility scores. “We have Brave New World crashing on us faster than we can imagine,” Novogratz added. “We’re in this very scary world where the blockchain and a decentralized system of payments, I think, are essential to our life liberty and pursuit of happiness.”",2019-05-12 14:13:53+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/track-rising-crypto-prices-with-cryptowat-ch/,"Track Rising Crypto Prices With Cryptowat.ch

Our team is making progress and has been working through the weekend. In the past few days, we have made some significant overhauls to our system, with a large number of advanced security features added and/or completely re-architected. We will share details on some of the changes later. We aim to fully resume deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday. The time will be communicated at a later stage, depending on how the testing goes. This upgrade will require a trading halt. We will update you again tomorrow.

Currently, all withdrawal and deposit actions are marked “Suspend” and cannot be carried out on the exchange. However, at least one user has said on social media that they were able to send deposits to the address by way of previously identified addresses.

In previous announcements the exchange announced upcoming support for hardware-based 2FA devices like YubiKey.

Binance announced the breach last week, saying that unnamed hackers made off with 7,000 BTC (worth about $41 million at the time) from the exchange’s hot wallet. The hackers accessed both user API keys and two-factor authentication codes to withdraw the crypto.

The exchange stopped withdrawals and deposits but allowed intra-token trading on the site. The hackers quickly moved the stolen bitcoin, causing some to speculate that they are preparing the launder the money through multiple exchanges.

On Wednesday, May 15, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will be upgraded to incorporate the highly anticipated Schnorr signature algorithm, a digital signature scheme widely known for its simplicity.

Also read: Bitcoin History Part 12: When No One Wanted Your BTC

Schnorr Sigs Are Coming

Next week, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain will be upgraded by adding two specific elements to the network’s underlying mechanics — Schnorr signatures and Segwit recovery exemption. Schnorr signatures will be a distinctive upgrade feature that gives the BCH chain a leading edge due to the signature schemes’ ability to promote privacy and scaling. The Schnorr signature algorithm was invented by the renowned cryptographer Claus Schnorr and cryptocurrency developers have been eager to implement Schnorr signatures for quite some time. Currently, BCH uses what’s called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm or ECDSA for transaction signatures. After May 15, however, the chain will offer both legacy style ECDSA transaction signatures and the ability to use basic Schnorr signatures as well.

Bitcoin cash transactions have a few elements that utilize basic cryptographic procedures. In a BCH transaction, a cryptographic signature is used to validate the owner of the funds. Alongside this, the cryptographic method ECDSA is employed to encrypt data so only a specific recipient can decrypt the information. The combination of these factors proves a BCH user’s ownership which constitutes the owner’s right to spend the bitcoin cash. Signatures also have to be provided for every BCH input within the transaction itself. ECDSA properties give two parties the ability to communicate BCH public and private keys securely. Schnorr signatures added to the Bitcoin Cash chain will offer the same properties as ECDSA, but will be far more efficient and powerful.

Hidden Payment Channels, Atomic Swaps and Multisignature Aggregation

BCH developers are adding Schnorr signatures because the method is a cleaner way to encrypt and decrypt data. With next week’s upgrade, developer Mark Lundeberg has detailed that Schnorr will be an optional replacement for ECDSA signatures. Lundeberg explained that users won’t have to generate new addresses to start using Schnorr signatures. With Schnorr, the developer has said that transactions can be 4% smaller due to signatures being 64 bytes of data in contrast to the usual 70. The feature basically enhances the effectiveness of signature data required for every bitcoin cash transaction. After the upgrade on Wednesday, BCH will have the added ability to utilize payment channels hidden as ordinary payments. Atomic swaps can be hidden as payments and in the future developers can add more sophisticated concepts like multisignature aggregation.

“From a UX point of view, Bitcoin Cash users and merchants accepting Bitcoin Cash via consumer-oriented wallets, such as the Bitcoin.com wallet app, aren’t likely to notice anything different at first glance,” Lundeberg noted. “But, if you view a new transaction after the May 15th upgrade, you may notice (and appreciate!) that its size is ~4% smaller than it would have been before.”

Lundeberg has also clarified that public signature aggregation would provide wallets with the ability to replace many transaction signatures with just one signature. This alone could enhance scaling in the future by adding a “~20% transaction size decrease, making the network faster and more efficient.” Further down the line, smart contracts or sign-to-contract concepts can be built, the programmer expounded, which will further enhance bitcoin cash privacy. The attributes provided by Schnorr and some clever engineering added by BCH developers and infrastructure providers like wallets will further enhance both privacy and scaling.

In just a few days the Bitcoin Cash network will be adding a sexy new feature and well before Bitcoin Core (BTC), whose developers have just announced a proposal to add the upgrade. There’s a lot of value pouring into BCH development-wise right now such as the Simple Ledger Protocol, Badger Wallet, Cash Accounts, Cashshuffle, the Bchd client and its privacy-enhancing wallet Neutrino. With Schnorr signatures coming, the BCH chain will be able to solidify its foundation and continue to provide fungible, peer-to-peer electronic cash to the masses.

Moreover, reports say that the coffee giant might start accepting bitcoin (BTC) payments in its U.S. branches later this year. So, is the long-awaited mainstream adoption finally coming to the crypto market?

As many mainstream companies, Starbucks leans toward the “blockchain before bitcoin” approach

Starbucks’ relationship with crypto could be traced back to January 2018, when its executive chairman and former CEO Howard Schultz discussed the subject during the company’s Q1 2018 earnings call.

Schultz appeared skeptical about bitcoin at the time, saying that it won’t be “a currency today or in the future.” However, the chairman suggested that some other cryptocurrencies might succeed instead:

“I’m bringing this up because as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior, I personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology.”

Those cryptocurrencies, Schultz added, would have to be legitimized by a brick-and-mortar environment.

In an interview with Fox Business that aired in March 2018, Schultz continued to discuss cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. “I think blockchain technology is probably the rails in which an integrated app at Starbucks will be sitting on top of,” the executive chairman declared.

First crypto steps: Bakkt, BTC payments

In August 2018, the Seattle-headquartered coffee giant revealed itself as one of Bakkt’s key partners, alongside Microsoft and consultancy Boston Consulting Group. Bakkt is a digital assets platform created by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is expected to launch later this year.

Notably, according to the original press release, Starbucks would not only be working with Bakkt to create its platform, but it would also be using it to accept crypto payments in its coffeehouses.

“As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,” said Maria Smith, vice president of partnerships and payments at Starbucks.

The news provoked bullish headlines akin to CNBC’s “New Starbucks partnership with Microsoft allows customers to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin.” However, the coffee retailer was quick to set the record straight. A Starbucks spokesperson told Vice on the same day the press release was published:

“It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks. At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.”

“Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,” the spokesperson specifically stressed.

In March, new details about Starbucks’ partnership with Bakkt surfaced, confirming its intention to accept BTC-based payments once an equity deal between the two is struck.

Thus, according to The Block’s report citing anonymous sources, Starbucks will install Bakkt’s payment software in its branches, which will allow customers to pay with digital assets. Such payments will be instantly converted to fiat, however, so that the coffee giant does not have to deal with crypto, supposedly to simplify accounting. The option will be available exclusively for U.S. customers first, the article suggests.

That’s “no different” than other BTC merchant programs out there and hence is not a major case of retail adoption, says Michael Dowling, CEO and founder of FairX, a financial services company involved with banking and digital assets, and former chief technology officer at IBM’s blockchain arm. He told Cointelegraph:

“No one wants to hold BTC because of its USD volatility, but they love how ‘easy’ it is to receive value on BTC as long as it converts immediately to USD.”

Dowling suggested that it could be an attempt for Starbucks and Bakkt to bypass Visa and MasterCard’s interchange fees through the initiative, which can be helpful to merchants, but nonetheless should come with its own shortcomings:

“As a merchant, you're just betting the exchange rate will be neutral or in your favor when it comes time to redeem. Oh yeah, and hopefully the redemption agent will always be able to provide USD liquidity.”

Eyal Shani, a blockchain researcher at Aykesubir, is also too skeptical to consider the initiative as a case of mainstream adoption, but admits that it could pave the way for further cases.

“Accepting bitcoin and immediately transferring it to fiat is simply enjoying the rate and exchange fees on Starbucks’ side,” he told Cointelegraph. “They can accept any currency together with the right fee to process it later. With that being said, any new real use case of bitcoin could serve as another step for larger adoption later down the road, if that happens.”

Charlie Smith, an analyst at asset management firm Blockforce Capital, however, thinks that Starbucks’ expected arrival into the field of BTC payments is a largely positive thing for the crypto market as it is. “While some may try to downplay this news because Starbucks will be instantly converting bitcoin payments into fiat currency, we do not believe it diminishes the significance of this news at all,” he wrote to Cointelegraph in an email, adding:

“We believe that Starbucks’ reported adoption of BTC as an accepted form of retail payment is a clear case of retail adoption. The fact that customers will be able to pay using bitcoin not only helps increase the overall usability of the currency but should also increase awareness and understanding of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, given Starbucks’ market share. Additionally, if a retail corporation on the scale of Starbucks has determined that it is in their best interest to accept bitcoin as a form of payment, it is a clear signal that there is a significant consumer population ready to use cryptocurrency as a form of payment on a day-to-day basis.”

As for the immediate conversion of BTC, Smith said it should be similar to how a U.S. company converts payments made in euros into U.S. dollars: “There is a big difference between retail adoption of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and those same corporations being able or willing to deal with the exchange rate risks inherent in any multinational organization. Starbucks instantly converting bitcoin payments into fiat currency does not impact the retail use case for bitcoin any more so than a US company converting payments made in Euros into USD impacts the retail use case for Euros.”

The analyst summarized:

“Starbucks adoption is a leap forward for cryptocurrencies allowing people to utilize their bitcoin for more than just an investment, which should hopefully lead to further adoption.''

Bean-to-cup initiative: arming farmers with a blockchain

This week, tech news publication GeekWire reported that Starbucks will implement tech giant Microsoft’s recently announced Azure Blockchain Service to track coffee production.

First announced in 2018, the initiative is called “bean to cup.” Initially, Starbucks mentioned that it was considering using a “traceability technology” for its coffee-tracking system, without specifying that it necessarily would be a blockchain.

Now, more details have been unveiled. The Azure-powered blockchain system will purportedly allow customers to track the production of their coffee and allegedly provide coffee farmers from Rwanda, Colombia and Costa Rica with more financial independence.

Additionally, Starbucks noted that it would make the pilot program open source to disseminate their findings. Other projects announced in collaboration with Microsoft include predictive drive-thru ordering and connecting Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled equipment at different cafe locations.

Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service was announced earlier in May. It is a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that allows users to build blockchain applications on a preconfigured network. It currently supports Quorum, the Ethereum-based platform of JPMorgan Chase. The new Microsoft BaaS aims to streamline the use of consortium blockchain networks, from creation to modification.

Explaining why Starbucks could pick the Microsoft blockchain solution over other ones, Shani suggested that it could be a move to strengthen the partnership:

“Although no relevant information was published, we can safely assume that the choice of Microsoft’s blockchain services over other options were mainly affected by the current partnerships the firms hold rather than the technical differences of blockchain on Azure vs blockchain managed services on AWS, at this level of maturity of those services.”

Indeed, the two companies seem to have a close relationship. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson is a former Microsoft executive who ran the worldwide sales and the Windows divisions before joining the coffeehouse chain in 2015.

Smith, on the other hand, argues that Microsoft's product is simply better for Starbucks than other options on the market. “Azure provides the ability to develop and implement blockchain technology into existing infrastructure in a faster and less resource intensive manner,” comparing to Quorum or other existing blockchain protocols, he told Cointelegraph.

“This allows Starbucks to focus on its own processes while outsourcing the responsibilities that may be best handled by a blockchain-savvy third party.”

Dowling of FairX suggested that Microsoft’s blockchain platform could seem more reputable to Starbucks than Quorum due to its roots:

“In enterprise IT, there's an old saying ‘no one gets fired for buying IBM.’ Basically, Quorum is written and maintained by JPM, which is a bank and not a SW dev shop. So, if I'm an enterprise customer, I'm going to feel much more comfortable with a Microsoft branded version – along with their support structure – over the JPM offering, even though they might be the same piece of software. JPM knows that, and that's why they partnered with Microsoft. That's also the reason R3 and IBM did the same with Corda and Fabric.”

Why Starbucks would need a blockchain

However, Dowling is not sure why Starbucks would need a blockchain in the first place. He suggested that it could represent a potentially efficient way to track which farmer is sourcing the best beans as ""voted"" by customers, but could not think of any other real case use that could be achieved with blockchain technology specifically:

“To be honest, I find the entire program, as explained in the press, very confusing and I'm not sure what problem they are trying to solve. [...] Why does it need to be decentralized? Why does this program — of people voting for beans, I think — require the application of public/private keys and a distributed database?”

Indeed, accomplishing this goal could be done without using blockchain, agrees Smith of Blockforce Capital, “but incorporating an enterprise blockchain solution is more efficient than alternatives.” He went on:

“With this initiative, Starbucks is looking to greatly bolster the transparency of its supply chain. [...] The proposed solution can be compared to how other blockchain networks, such as the bitcoin network, validate a large number of transactions without a centralized authority. The underlying technology is similar, its application is just different.”

There are other major cases of corporations successfully incorporating blockchain, the analyst adds, arguing that the technology should be the right fit for the “fair trade” concept that is popular within the coffee industry in particular:

“The IBM Food Trust program works with Walmart and other major food producers to track food production in order to help stem food-borne illnesses. Starbucks is tackling a similar problem but for a different reason. Whereas food safety isn’t the root cause, Starbucks wants to provide customers the opportunity to track where the coffee they consume is being produced. Any person that is even a casual coffee consumer has heard the term ‘fair trade’ used quite frequently. The concept of fair trade has gained significant attention over the past several years in a number of industries, with coffee being one of, if not the largest industry to focus on fair trade. Through the ‘bean-to-cup’ initiative’s use of blockchain, customers will be able to personally verify where their coffee is coming from and pinpoint specific producers that are producing coffee sustainably and fairly, as well as those that are creating exceptional coffee. A customer drinking Starbucks today has little to no idea who is producing the coffee they are consuming, and can only rely on a sticker to ‘verify’ that coffee is fair trade. In essence, Starbucks is looking for a way to provide greater accountability and that can be accomplished with an enterprise blockchain solution.”

Similarly, Shani believes that the “bean-to-cup” initiative is part of the general “food trust” trend empowered by blockchain:

“The use of blockchain in the food supply chain is a very interesting one for several reasons. If you’re a building constructor, you’re very likely to buy your hammers all at one place. Firms like Starbucks source their coffee beans from hundreds of thousands of small farmers to meet demand. Some of those farmers won’t even be registered business in their home countries. It is impossible to maintain trust when dealing with such large scale long-branched supply chain. Instead of making one entity to hold all the data and attest it’s correct, a smarter idea would be to create a collaborative blockchain based database where every party is liable to their part.”

However, the blockchain researcher added that even a centralized database could create new opportunities within the coffee industry, considering “the state in which the legacy systems are today.” Shani also stressed that neither the exact architecture of the solution nor the trust model have been disclosed by Startbucks at this point.

The potential financial opportunities for coffee farmers mentioned in the press release and the GeekTimes report are also somewhat unclear.

“The only thing I can think of here is there's a payment rail component that reduces the cost of cross-border transactions,” Dowling told Cointelegraph. “Though they make no mention of that. Or there's some kind of ‘bean-coin’ the farmers get, and they redeem that for fiat? If that's the case, why blockchain?”

Given that the main benefit of the “bean-to-cup” initiative is that it can provide farmers increased transparency and a large amount of new data, Smith suggested, it could allow them to build their unique brands “outside the overall Starbucks name.” He continued:

“Currently, when you buy coffee from Starbucks the only information available is the type of coffee and the country where it was grown. By utilizing blockchain, Starbucks will be able to provide its customers with endless amounts of new information, such as when the coffee was harvested, when it was shipped, what farm it came from, and potentially even the farming techniques used as that farm.

“This will provide customers with greater power to support certain farmers, whether because of sustainability or simply because that farmer makes the best tasting coffee. This, in turn, should allow the more than 380,000 farms to differentiate themselves and build a unique brand outside of the overall Starbucks name. From the farmers’ standpoint, this new service should provide valuable data on consumer preferences and taste profiles, which will allow farmers to form data-driven conclusions and help them make more profitable decisions.”

Cointelegraph has reached out to Starbucks to clarify why it would need a blockchain and how exactly it could benefit the coffee farmers, among other things, but has not heard back as of press time.",,https://www.coindesk.com/above-7-5k-bitcoin-price-hits-highest-level-since-august-2018,"Bitcoin’s price rose above $7,500 Sunday for the first time in over nine months, a move that marked a resurgence in the crypto market at large.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which accounts for more than half of all the total cryptocurrency market, jumped to $7,577 at 13:36 GMT – the highest price since August 2, 2018, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

The surge, however, seems to have slightly cooled off thereafter, with the price currently trading at $7,100, suggesting the market considered the asset overbought.

The move to nine-month highs has come a day after the last remnants of bearish sentiment were snuffed out, and the trend appeared to switch to a long-term bull market. Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to a record high of $29.33 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $1.87 billion, according to Messari.io.

Further, still, bitcoin’s dominance rate, a measure of its market share versus that of other cryptocurrencies, has hit a 17-month high of 59 percent, indicating the broader market has lagged the recent bitcoin price rally.

But bitcoin’s dominance rate may drop in the coming days, as the alternative cryptocurrencies are beginning to show signs of life, with names like bitcoin cash, tezos and bitcoin gold flashing double-digit gains at press time.

Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like litecoin, EOS, XRP, and Binance coin have gained 6 to 9 percent each on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.

What’s more, the total market capitalization has risen to a six-month high of $219 billion, while the market capitalization of altcoins has witnessed a flag breakout – a bullish continuation pattern – indicating better days ahead for the alternative cryptocurrencies in general.

Today, bitcoin is so precious that its hodlers are prone to locking their keys away inside nuclear bunkers, bank vaults, and military grade hardware wallets. But things weren’t always that way. Back in the early days, bitcoin was deemed so undesirable that you would have struggled to give it away, while exchanging it for fiat currency was out of the question.

Also read: Bitcoin History Part 11: The First Major Loss of Coins

One Man’s Junk is Another Man’s Treasure

The bitcoins you buy and sell on exchanges today for several thousand dollars apiece are in many cases the very same coins that were changing hands back in 2010. The properties of those coins, despite having passed through hundreds of wallets in the intervening years, haven’t changed: one bitcoin today is exactly the same as one bitcoin from 2010. What has changed is the value accorded to each one. Just as gold is precious on our planet, but a worthless rock to anyone inhabiting an asteroid made out of the aureate metal, when bitcoin was easy to extract and there were few ways to use it, exchanging it – for anything – was virtually impossible.

Most bitcoiners, even those who were late to the game, will recall Laszlo Hanyecz. He’s the guy who famously completed the first recorded purchase of goods with cryptocurrency, when he acquired two Domino’s pizzas for 10,000 BTC in May 2010. It might be assumed that once this historic transaction went down, the floodgates were opened to a wave of merchant adoption and a thriving exchange ecosystem was spawned. The reality is less invigorating. On June 15, 2010, three weeks after completing the pizza transaction, Laszlo tried to complete another BTC sale, this time for something less evanescent – a camera. Would anyone take him up on his offer?

Wanted: Canon Camera Equipment

“I would be willing to pay a combination of bitcoins and USD for used Canon compatible photo equipment.. lenses and filters and such,” wrote Laszlo on the Bitcointalk forum. “If anyone is looking to sell this kind of stuff let me know.” His thread was greeted with silence. “Still interested in this if anyone has any lenses and such they want to convert to cash/bitcoins,” added Laszlo a month later. Still nothing.

Laszlo’s follow up post was composed just three days before Mt. Gox was launched, the exchange which took bitcoin from ignominy to the moon. And yet, incredible as it may seem today, bitcoin was so unknown and unappreciated, save for to a few early believers, that getting rid of your coins in mid 2010 was virtually impossible. A month prior to Laszlo’s failed camera buying attempt, and two days before his pizza sale was completed, someone else attempted to create a mechanism for swapping BTC for goods.

“I’m accepting Bitcoins now for [online game] A Tale in the Desert,” wrote forum user Teppy. “A player tells the game client that he wants to subscribe. I generate an address and tell him “Send 2000 BTC to [address]”, and then when the Bitcoins show up I credit his month of playtime.” Like Laszlo, Teppy struggled to generate interest in his proposal, and it is unclear whether A Tale in the Desert ever collected a single subscription in BTC.

Today bitcoin can be used to purchase all manner of goods, from airline tickets to t-shirts. And yet, paradoxically, due to the immense value it’s acquired, most bitcoiners are reluctant to part with their coins.

Former Bitcoin Core dev Mike Hearn says R3's Corda owes much of its intellectual property to bitcoin. | Source: Youtube/ The Conference / Media Evolution

By CCN.com: “Corda is more like Bitcoin,” says Mike Hearn, lead engineer for Corda, the open source blockchain of the industry consortium R3.

“It owes more of its intellectual history to bitcoin than Ethereum in a way. Its’ data model is similar to Bitcoin, which enables you to have privacy because you don’t see transactions on your critical path.”

Early Bitcoin adopters knew the risk they were taking, he says, despite infamously stating bitcoin had failed in early 2016 upon leaving as a core developer. “They had money on their device and if the software wasn’t good or had bugs, then that is the cost of being a part of the global revolution,” said Hearn.

But, he warns, Corda is no global revolution. “We are optimizing existing economies in effect,” he says. “We aren’t here to overthrow any systems. As a consequence, people’s standards are much higher. People’s tolerance for sharp edges is much lower.”

At the community level, Corda is an open-source project like Bitcoin. It is funded by R3. There are a mailing list and a Slack channel where you can talk to the employees and even make suggestions.

So, how is Corda’s data model similar to bitcoin’s?

“They both use what’s called the ‘UTXO model’,” he replies. “[T]hat is, they see the ledger as a set of unchanging entries representing value or facts, that are deleted and created but never altered. In contrast, Ethereum sees the ledger as a set of programs that send messages to each other. It’s a very different way of looking at the world.”

While Bitcoin uses the programming languages C++ and Satoshi-designed, yet limited, Bitcoin Script, and Ethereum developed ‘Solidity’ (designed to look like Javascript) for development, Corda has not created its own programming languages.

“We are not inventing our own custom programming language or environments,” said Hearn. “We are using Java and Kotlin, but you can use regular Java or Scala, as well. Any of the languages that run on the JVM. These are much more professionally built languages and tools. They are very mature, they’ve been around decades, and the people who build them know what they are doing, and took their time. You don’t get the same surprising glitches you see in a little Solidity development on Ethereum.” JVM refers to Java virtual machine, which enables a computer to run Java-related programs.

“Kotlin is developed by JetBrains,” Mr. Hearn adds. “It targets the JVM and JavaScript. It’s similar to C# and is designed for developer productivity.” What are people designing on Corda?

“People are mostly designing financial apps today,” he said of Corda developers. “But, people are starting to explore more with healthcare and logistics, and so on.”

Bitcoin is not designed for such feats. “Bitcoin’s feature set is designed for tracking a single currency, and that’s about it,” explains Mr. Hearn. “To the extent, it can be extended by developers, it’s to impose flexible controls on that currency, but it doesn’t go beyond that.” As a simple example, entries in the Bitcoin database consist of a value (amount of coins) plus the script that controls who can claim that value.

“But there’s no way to encode, for instance, a ledger entry for barrels of oil that records the type of crude oil, the origin of extraction, the shipment dates, etc.,” he says. “Bitcoin doesn’t know about any of that.”

Both Corda and other platforms use the term “smart contracts” in a more expansive way than Satoshi did. “We want to be able to manage any kind of data, not just amounts of a single currency,” says Mr. Hearn.

He notes that when he wrote Lighthouse, a Bitcoin crowdfunding management app, he had to do a lot of things himself that Corda would handle for him. “It’d have been much faster to implement it on Corda,” he says.

A Different Programming Language with Corda Than Bitcoin

Corda developers chose not to develop on C++, as Satoshi did, because the high-level programming language has a number of problems. “[I]t’s very complex and hard to learn, it’s easy to make security errors that Java/Kotlin would automatically block, and the business world doesn’t use much of it anymore for these reasons,” said Hearn. “‘Script’ was invented for Bitcoin but is far too limited to do even the things Satoshi imagined, let alone the much more complicated things our users want to do.”

Could someone develop a competitor to Bitcoin on Corda? Indeed, says Hearn. R3 programmers have done thought experiments about building a bitcoin-style cryptocurrency on top of the enterprise-focused platform.

“It is not the goal of the organization,” Mr. Hearn said. “A few others and I think it’d be cool. It certainly should be possible. We have worked out how you could do it with Corda more as an intellectual exercise. But, most of our customers want to use existing currencies.”

Most enterprise blockchains start from Ethereum as their design base, Mr. Hearn says. “It’s unusual to go back to the start and pledge allegiance to Satoshi’s thinking and designs,” he notes. “We were familiar with both designs and felt Bitcoin’s would work better.”",2019-05-12 06:06:24+00:00

The virtual currency climbed close to $7,600 on Sunday, according to industry website CoinDesk. It's since pared gains, but is still holding above that $7,000 level.

It marks yet another move higher for the world's most-valuable cryptocurrency, which is now up nearly 90% since the start of the year.

That's despite negative headlines surrounding bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, whose parent company has been hit with a probe in New York, and Binance, which was hacked in a heist that lost more than $40 million in bitcoin.

""Bitcoin has been building up momentum,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at social trading firm eToro, told CNBC via telephone. ""Ever since the mid-December lows, we've actually doubled in price.""

According to Greenspan, the digital currency could soar because bitcoin is still only ""in the early part of its cycle."" Bitcoin was once worth nearly $20,000 in late December 2017, before a massive slump last year.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Reddit proposed several theories for the sudden rally.

They highlighted the US-China trade war, institutional interest, exodus from alt coins, the Bitfinex scandal, and the Binance hack as possible reasons.

Watch Bitcoin trade live.

Bitcoin spiked to more than $7,500 on Sunday — a sharp rise from its $5,000 level at the start of May, and more than double its price in mid-December. Analysts have struggled to identify one single catalyst.

""With no major news factors behind the aggressive appreciation, the sharp $1000 jump over the weekend remains a mystery to investors,"" wrote Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, in a research note.

However, crypto-fans have weighed in with competing theories on its sudden rise, which run the gamut from compelling to wildly far-fetched.

Here are five reasons for the rise, according to Reddit users:

1. Safe haven

""It's possible that a great number of rich people know that the traditional markets are effed eight ways to Tuesday,"" wrote diydude2 on the r/bitcoin thread's daily discussion.

President Trump has sparked a global market sell-off after accusing China of walking back agreed provisions in a draft trade deal, hiking tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, and preparing to expand tariffs to effectively all Chinese products in the next month if a trade agreement isn't struck. Investors may have bought up Bitcoin to hedge their exposure to conventional assets.

2. Mainstream appeal

""Institutions are scrambling to get in ahead of the traditional brokerages' launch (Fidelity, Ameritrade, Etrade) so they can dump on the next wave of retail investors to enter the space,"" wrote Savage_X in the same discussion.

Fidelity, one of the world's largest asset managers, will begin buying and selling bitcoin for its institutional customers in the next few weeks, according to Bloomberg. Online broker TD Ameritrade introduced trading of bitcoin futures in December, while securities brokerage E*Trade is preparing to enable cryptocurrency trading on its platform, Bloomberg wrote.

Rival institutions could be buying up bitcoin with the expectation that the entry of major players into the market could bolster the cryptocurrency's credibility and drive mainstream purchases, pushing up its price.

3. Exodus from alt coins

""The ICO experiment is over,"" wrote gonzales82 in a thread about the Bitcoin spike, referring to the recent boom in cryptocurrency launches known as initial coin offerings.

""People are waking up to the realization that bitcoin is a much larger idea than any of the blockchain phantasmagorias people have been trying to push for the last couple of years.""

There's evidence to support the idea that investors are shifting funds from other cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin.

""From purely looking at the data — one factor that could be behind at least the BTC rally is the conversion of 'alt' coins into bitcoin,"" Sid Shekhar, co-founder of Token Analyst, said in an interview with Business Insider. ""For example, we have consistently been seeing a lot more BTC being transferred out of exchanges than going in.""

4. The Bitfinex scandal drove Bitcoin purchases

The Bitcoin rally could also be a product of the Bitfinex scandal. New York Attorney General Letitia James recently filed a lawsuit accusing the owner of the Bitfinex exchange of ""ongoing fraud"" and draining at least $700 million from the reserves backing its digital coin, Tether, to cover up $850 million in missing funds.

'I think Bitcoin is going up because [of] the whole Bitfinex thing going on...I think they are having a lot of issues [fulfilling] withdrawal requests,"" wrote sanderson22.

""I think a lot of people are buying Bitcoin [and] getting out of Tether, I think a crash will come if Bitfinex's house of cards collapse[s] and they wound up losing a lot of people's money.""

Other commenters voiced similar views.

""It seems to me as soon as the Tether/Bitfinex scandal started to come out the price went straight up,"" wrote Swt23. ""Could this not be from people that had a lot of the money stored in Tether [deciding] it might be safer to move out of Tether into Bitcoin.""

A wild theory suggests Bitfinex's owners are driving up the price of Bitcoin to replenish the exchange's cash reserves.

""Bitfinex is throwing everything they have at generating a new pump to attract whatever $USD influx they can get from FOMO'ing butters because they are otherwise completely cash insolvent,"" wrote Poop_Shame.

5. The Binance hack proved Bitcoin's integrity

After hackers stole $40 million of Bitcoin from Binance last week, the cryptocurrency exchange's CEO, Changpeng Zhao, proposed a rollback of the blockchain to reverse the illicit transactions and recover the funds. The fierce backlash to his suggestion may have bolstered Bitcoin's image as a legitimate currency and fueled demand for it.

""I think [Binance] might have helped Bitcoin a lot with their suggestion to rollback the chain,"" wrote 2btc20000pizzas. ""That notion was swiftly shut down by the community (users, devs, and miners) almost within a single day.""

Bitcoin advocates' claims that the cryptocurrency is ""censorship-resistant"" and ""scarce"" became ""more tangible when the very notion of tampering with the blockchain was shut down within hours,"" the commenter added. ""I really think for a lot of people, [this] might have just [shone] a light on why Bitcoin more than any other altcoin has value, and isn't just stupid Internet money.""

Bitcoin was up 5% at $7,048 at the time of writing.

NOW WATCH: Warren Buffett, the third-richest person in the world, is also one of the most frugal billionaires. Here's how he makes and spends his fortune.",2019-05-10,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18617554/flexa-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-etherium-whole-foods-gamestop-nordstrom-flexacoin,"A new payment network called Flexa is launching today that’ll let you spend cryptocurrencies in physical stores. The technology currently supports bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and the gemini dollar, and it’ll work at retailers including GameStop, Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Caribou Coffee, Jamba Juice, and Crate and Barrel. The eventual goal for Flexa is to support payments using any cryptocurrency to pay any merchant.

You pay for your items using Flexa’s app, Spedn, which generates a QR code that you scan at the checkout register. The merchant receives immediate payment in dollars, and the equivalent amount of cryptocurrency is debited from your cryptocurrency wallet in the Spedn app.

The system is underpinned by Flexa’s own FlexaCoin currency

In order to achieve this immediate payment, Flexa has a complicated process going on in the background. Flexa uses its own cryptocurrency, FlexaCoin, to secure each transaction before it’s approved by the originating coin’s network. The Flexa Network Protocol works as an intermediary for each payment. It pays the merchant in cash and then goes through the slower process of taking payment from your cryptocurrency wallet. The network is essentially taking on the risk of not receiving the cryptocurrency from your wallet, and it’s using the FlexaCoin currency as collateral. It’s a pretty complicated process, but it seems this is what’s needed to make immediate payments.

Making cryptocurrencies usable in physical shops has become a key challenge for digital currency networks. Although retailers are able to set up their own cryptocurrency wallets and take payments directly, this exposes them to price volatility and the slow transaction speeds that blockchain networks can suffer from. Coinbase, a major cryptocurrency exchange, recently took a different approach, launching a Visa debit card that takes cryptocurrency out of your digital wallet. However, a similar card in the US closed down in April after operating for just over three years.",2019-05-13,https://news.bitcoin.com/whole-foods-and-major-retailers-now-accept-cryptocurrency-via-the-spedn-app/,"Whole Foods and Major Retailers Now Accept Cryptocurrency via Spedn

On May 13, cryptocurrency enthusiasts were pleased to hear that major retailers including Whole Foods, Lowes, Petco, Regal Cinemas, and Gamestop will accept payments in crypto. The payments will be processed by Flexa using its custodial wallet called ‘Spedn’ which gives people the ability to spend with bitcoin core, ethereum, bitcoin cash, and GUSD.

Spedn App Allows Crypto Purchases at Many Well Known Retailers

Digital currencies got a mainstream push today from the startup Flexa and its new wallet called Spedn. Users will be able to spend a variety of cryptocurrencies including BCH, BTC, GUSD, and ETH at a multitude of well-known establishments. This includes Lowes, Gamestop, Whole Foods, Petco, Barnes & Noble, Regal Cinemas, Baskin Robbins, Crate and Barrel, and Nordstrom. According to the startup, the application works due to a partnership between Flexa and its retail partners and the digital currency firm Gemini. The platform basically allows the user to load up one of the wallets with any coin and purchase items with one of the partner shops.

The Flexa network was a project cofounded by Tyler Spalding, Trevor Filter, Zachary Kilgore, and Daniel McCabe. Flexa uses its own cryptocurrency called Flexacoin in the background, the company has explained. Essentially Flexacoin is used as collateral to secure payments until the transaction is approved on one of the four public blockchains. The team says they built Flexa because they believe existing payment networks are broken and rather than team up with a debit card provider they decided to work with a large network of merchants.

“Over the past year, we’ve built new connections with tens of thousands of merchant point-of-sale terminals nationwide, to bypass the existing payments infrastructure and push cryptocurrency-based payment authorizations directly to merchants on your behalf,” Flexa’s announcement noted.

30,476 Stores Accepting Crypto

Essentially the partnerships allow users the ability to spend their cryptos at 30,476 stores according to the company blog. Flexa says that the company has more apps coming that will tie into the Flexa network and later this year the startup will be releasing its open source SDK so wallets can integrate the same Flexa payments as well.

The company emphasized that it aims to show the world “just how transformative cryptocurrencies can be for all kinds of payments, not just peer-to-peer transactions, but also retail payments, dining, and beyond.”

“Already, we’ve seen firsthand just how excited merchants are at the prospects of accepting cryptocurrencies in their stores to reduce payment fraud and processing costs,” Flexa’s announcement highlighted. The startup continued:

The world of payments is evolving quickly now, and we believe that Flexa will be a massive part of the shift toward more efficient and more accessible commerce around the globe.

Top brands such as Whole Foods, Baskin Robbins, Lowe’s, and Nordstrom will now accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Gemini Dollar.

Flexa network is establishing new payments infrastructure for crypto. The payments network is bypassing existing infrastructure by building new connections with point-of-sale terminals across the U.S. Flexa claims it will be able to lower processing fees, reduce fraud, and preserve user privacy with its new cryptocurrency-enabled network.

Flexa’s first app, SPEDN, is designed with a single purpose—allowing people to spend cryptocurrency. The app allows users to spend crypto at fifteen of the biggest brands, including Whole Foods, Petco, Lowe’s, Nordstrom, Baskin Robbins, and others.

Flexa also announced a partnership with Gemini, a regulated cryptocurrency exchange based in New York City. All user funds stored on SPEDN are custodied and insured by Gemini.

The development is a major win for cryptocurrency’s acceptance as a medium-of-exchange. Although bitcoin has made tangible progress entrenching itself as a store of value, adoption as a payment medium is slow going and has faced setbacks.

In the past, major retailers such as Steam and Twitch reversed their decisions to accept crypto due to price volatility, fraud, or lack of demand. Meanwhile, the infrastructure and technology around cryptocurrency have steadily improved since bitcoin’s inception, both in terms of security and cost.

Bitcoin has been able to substantially reduce transaction fees on the network through improvements on its protocol, while other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum take advantage of other innovations to offer even lower fees.

Now, the general public can be exposed to cryptocurrency as a legitimate means of payment, as opposed to its longstanding perception as a means for evading taxes and purchasing drugs. And, with exposure comes adoption.",2019-05-13 17:52:03+00:00,https://mashable.com/article/binance-restore-withdrawals-deposits/,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which is recovering from last week's security incident which allowed hackers to steal 7,000 bitcoins (roughly $40 million), said on Monday it has strengthened its security and promised it will allow deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday, May 14.

Following the hack, Binance halted all deposits and withdrawals to its platform until it could fully investigate what had caused the security breach. Trading on Binance was allowed to continue.

""In the past few days, we have made some significant overhauls to our system, with a large number of advanced security features added and/or completely re-architected. We will share details on some of the changes later,"" Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote in a blog post.

""We aim to fully resume deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday. The time will be communicated at a later stage, depending on how the testing goes. This upgrade will require a trading halt,"" he wrote, promising another update tomorrow, as well as a longer update with more details after all operations on the platform have been resumed.

The news of the hack, as well as halted withdrawals and deposits on one of the world largest cryptocurrency exchanges, didn't do much to stop Bitcoin's meteoric price rise. Over the weekend, Bitcoin at one point reached the price of $7,500, the highest since August 2018, and more than double the price from just three months ago. Bitcoin's price has tapered off significantly on Monday, and is currently at $7,029.

Disclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.",2019-05-13 08:16:33+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-launches-decentralized-identity-tool-on-bitcoin-blockchain,"Microsoft is launching the first decentralized infrastructure implementation by a major tech company that is built directly on the bitcoin blockchain.

The open source project, called Ion, deals with the underlying mechanics of how networks talk to each other. For example, if you log onto Airbnb using Facebook, a protocol deals with the software that sends the personal information from your social profile to that external service provider. In this case, Ion handles the decentralized identifiers, which control the ability to prove you own the keys to this data.

Christopher Allen, a crypto veteran and the co-founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group for decentralized identity (DID) solutions, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s move could impact the entire tech industry.

“A lot of enterprise infrastructures use Microsoft products,” Allen said. “So if they integrate this into any of their infrastructure products, they’ll have access to DID.”

Indeed, Yorke Rhodes, a program manager on Microsoft’s blockchain engineering team, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s team has been working for a year on a key signing and validation software that relies on public networks, like bitcoin or ethereum, yet can handle far greater throughput than the underlying blockchain itself.

Underscoring the fact that Microsoft was a founding member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, Rhodes said:

“There are systems that we have at Microsoft that give you permissions in an enterprise context, a product called Active Directory, that we think need to be able to recognize these DIDs as well.”

He added such infrastructure products and services related to Azure are among the Microsoft’s most popular offerings. This tiny piece in a giant machine, then, could have far-reaching impacts.

Meanwhile, an anonymous source with knowledge of Microsoft’s project told CoinDesk that Ion will shift from using bitcoin’s testnet to the bitcoin mainnet later this year. As such, any tech-savvy observer could run a node and contribute to this project.

Said W3C’s Allen:

“To have Microsoft say they are not scared of bitcoin, and in fact, it has some very good properties and we are willing to take advantage of those properties, is, I think, a step in the right direction.”

Stepping back, the difference between a DID under the hood, versus current infrastructure, speaks to the heart of users owning their own content and access. In the example of Facebook and Airbnb, with a DID, Facebook might be able to shut down your social media account but could not revoke access to all the tools that relied on the Facebook ID to log in. Plus, all those personal photos on Facebook would belong to the user, the holder of the DID.

Yet Facebook, in particular, may not align with Microsoft’s approach.

Another anonymous source told CoinDesk that although Facebook has been invited to participate in Microsoft’s DID projects and community efforts, so far the social media company has declined and instead continued to follow its historic approach to user data.

“They’re going in a different direction that’s not as decentralized,” the source said of Facebook.

Corporate conflicts

The Wall Street Journal and others have reported that Facebook is looking to build a stablecoin-based payments platform for the social network. Yet Allen said he hasn’t seen any effort from Facebook to support DID standards or community efforts such as W3C, which may create a rift with corporations like Microsoft that are making such standards a core pillar of their business model.

Rouven Heck, head of DID at ConsenSys and active member of the W3C, told CoinDesk that Facebook is noticeably absent from community discussions across the tech industry about DIDs.

And although Rhodes said he was not aware of any dealings with Facebook, there was clearly a misalignment between the two company’s goals for using blockchain technology.

“Facebook is the complete antithesis of consumer privacy,” he said. “Their business model is based on the fact they can monetize data about you.”

What’s more, U.S. Senate Banking Committee last week wrote a letter to Facebook that voiced concerns about how the social media company will handle financial data with its crypto project, which is codenamed Libra. Few details about Libra have been shared to date outside of press reports.

In the past, Allen said that Facebook only implemented parts of protocols that enabled data sharing “in a proprietary way that only benefited” Facebook.

With regards to what approach the social media giant will take to blockchain systems, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk:

“Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share.”

Ethical capitalism

In contrast to the allegations that Facebook is taking a different direction with its project, both ConsenSys and Microsoft are opting to make open source initiatives core pillars of their respective business models.

“If we can create certain standards it will help the system to build up faster, and that’s good for all of us,” Heck said. “The different products we have are all useful across the space and not built into some proprietary niche.”

Rhodes agrees with this approach, saying that engaging with the open source ecosystem serves Microsoft’s business objectives. He said the “philosophy of consumer ownership and consumer centricity” are core principles for designing Microsoft’s software going forward.

Allen said he hopes a sense of public responsibility will continue to be viewed as a competitive advantage – especially as Microsoft Azure goes head-to-head with Amazon Web Services for cloud market share.

“You could have a service that is in the cloud hosted by Microsoft Azure, but is absolutely secure because everything in it is encrypted with your keys that you control and everything that run under your authority, even though it’s in the cloud,” Allen said.

In Rhodes’ opinion, current experiments with blockchain technology are comparable to Microsoft releasing Windows 95 in decades past, which helped boost mainstream internet usage through a consumer-oriented operating system.

“Networking stacks were very tied to logins to existing networks,” Rhodes said of the pre-Windows 95 internet. “Like that, I think [Ion] is pretty significant.”

Terpin filed the case against 21-year-old Nicholas Truglia earlier this year, saying the Manhattan resident had defrauded him of cryptocurrencies after gaining control of his cellphone number. California Superior Court has now ordered Truglia to pay Terpin $75.8 million in compensatory and punitive damages, Reuters reported Saturday citing court documents.

Terpin had complained of losing three million unspecified cryptos via the hack in early 2018, which were worth $23.8 million at the time, according to the report.

In a SIM-swap scam, hackers pose as the owners of victims’ mobile phone numbers, convincing telecom providers to grant them access to their calls and messages by issuing a SIM with the same number. In this way, they can gain access to important accounts, such as those held at crypto exchanges.

Terpin also sued telecoms firm AT&T last August, claiming the company had failed to protect his cellphone data. “In recent incidents, law enforcement has even confirmed that AT&T employees profited from working directly with cyber terrorists and thieves in SIM swap frauds,” he contended at the time.

Truglia is also reportedly alleged to have used the SIM-swapping method to steal from a number of individuals. He was arrested in New York last November and faces 21 felony counts related to six victims, the New York Post reported late last year.

SIM-swapping is becoming an increasingly popular way for criminals to access the cryptocurrency wallets of victims and there have been accusations that mobile providers are not doing enough to protect their customers. Indeed, U.S.-based law firm Silver Miller recently filed arbitration claims against AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of victims who have been hacked using the method.

In a recent case, the U.S. Department of Justice last week indicted a group of six individuals dubbed “The Community,” alleging that they had stolen cryptocurrencies using SIM-swaps.

At 21:30 UTC today, the price world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as high as $8,195 on Coinbase, marking a 17.4 percent or $1214 increase during today’s trading session.

In the past 24 hours alone, Messari data reveals more than $27 billion worth of bitcoin was traded across exchanges, whereas $2,1 billion was traded solely on the 10 exchanges Bitwise Asset Management identified as the only exchanges reporting honest volume figures.

While vigorous, today’s development is not an anomaly. In fact, bitcoin’s price increases have been aggressive for much of 2019 and rose more than $1000 dollars once again just two days ago.

In the past 90-days alone the cryptocurrency has increased 127 percent in price, nearly 60 percent of which was accrued in the last 30 days alone, Messari data reveals.

The USD value of most cryptocurrencies are seeing notable increases as a result of bitcoin’s rebound, including the likes of Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both of whom are reporting double-digit 24-hour gains.

That said, bitcoin’s percent share of the capitalization of the total cryptocurrency market is now a 60 percent – its highest since Dec. 11, 2017 according to Coinmarketcap, and a sign its growth is outpacing the rest of the broader market.

History repeating?

Interestingly, a very similar and parabola shaped price increase like the one bitcoin has just witnessed occurred at the end of the previous bear market in 2015.

As can be seen below, bitcoin’s price trend entered a parabolic rise after reaching a low of $198 on Aug. 25, 2015 followed by a near 150 percent increase before temporarily topping out at $499 on Nov. 4th of that year.

Is #bitcoin repeating history again? The current parabolic rise looks very similar to how the previous bear market in 2014-15 ended. $BTC/USD increased roughly 150% from previous lows on both occasions. pic.twitter.com/LQa8iBnR4S — CoinDesk Markets (@CoinDeskMarkets) May 13, 2019

Indeed, history seems to be repeating itself, or at least rhyming, as bitcoin’s market has once again entered a parabolic structure having increased nearly 150 percent from its most recent low of $3,128 set on Dec. 15, 2018.

The cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise is reminiscent of its rocketing growth in the latter half of 2017, when prices reached more than $18,400 on the back of buoyant capital markets, rampant speculation and a turbulent political climate in Northern Asia spurred by saber rattling between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un.

While geopolitical tension is once again gripping the market (thanks to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China), that may only be one factor contributing to Bitcoin’s surge.

“Anticipation of the upcoming supply shock [of new BTC introduced via mining] may be creating upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin,” wrote Alyse Killeen, a partner at the investment and advisory firm Stillmark, in an email. “Bitcoin is introduced to the market when the Bitcoin protocol rewards miners who validate blockchain transactions. Specifically, the Bitcoin protocol gives BTC to miners for adding blocks to the blockchain. Today, miners earn 12.5 BTC for adding a new block that is accepted by the network. In May 2020, the time of the next ‘halvening,’ that reward will be reduced to 6.25 BTC, thereby reducing the total number of BTC introduced to the market on a daily basis.”

Killeen also noted that Bitcoin is inherently more valuable today than it was at the same time last year. More Americans can access Bitcoin through apps like Cash and Robinhood, and TD Ameritrade’s BTC contracts and (soon) eTrade.

Technology advances are also making Bitcoin more useful and more secure, Killeen wrote. The development of the Lightning Network is proceeding and creating a new application ecosystem, while the Blockstream Satellite network is creating redundancies in blockchain availability.

In fact, the number of businesses that take Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies expanded exponentially yesterday thanks to an agreement between the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin purveyor Gemini (owned by the Winkelvoss twins of Facebook and Social Network fame) and the payment network Flexa, whose technology is undergirded by cryptocurrencies.

Using Gemini’s exchange and clearing house and Flexa’s transaction technology, most of the stores an American consumer encounters in their trip to the mall now accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payments.

That adoption doesn’t explain the bump in Bitcoin prices entirely. And skeptics of digital cryptocurrencies argue that there could be a simpler explanation for the rise in digital currencies right now — good old-fashioned price manipulation.

As crypto-skeptic David Gerard wrote in this blog post yesterday:

It’s because the price of Bitcoin is a proxy for margin trading — and rather than investing in the commodity itself, you can make more money by manipulating this thin and ill-regulated market to burn the margin traders. This also allows the large holders — the “whales,” and the exchanges themselves — to cash out to whatever little actual-money US dollars are available, in a trading system where the liquidity is mostly fake dollars called “tethers.” Willy Woo explains how short squeezes work in crypto. This is a pattern we see over and over: 1) When the market is majority short, there’s too much money to be had to allow them to win. 2) Whales keep buying up the market until the shorts get liquidated. 3) At liquidation the short seller has to buy back at market price. 4) A tidal wave of buys cascade through the orderbooks, a chain reaction, the price goes vertical. 5) Whale payday. The whales that bought up the market sheparding the price up now dump their positions at profit. 6) Blow-off. The price comes down to its organic levels.

Other investors, like Travis Scher at the Digital Currency Group, think that it’s as simple as a new class of investor looking at Bitcoin as a new store of value and a haven for investors looking to escape volatile public markets.

“I spend very little time trying to understand or explain short-term crypto price movements, as the price and the fundamentals often seem to move in diametrically opposed directions. So all I can say with certainty is that there are more buyers than sellers in recent months,” Scher wrote in an email. “But in this case, I do think that one factor driving the rally is that the narrative around Bitcoin as digital gold is growing. We fully expect Bitcoin to replace gold as the leading non-government controlled store of value over the coming decade.”",2019-05-14 00:00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/bitcoin-adds-market-share-as-crypto-winter-turns-glorious-summer,"Why did this happen?

The news: The twins’ digital currency company, called Gemini, has formed a new partnership with payments startup Flexa to incorporate crypto-payment capabilities into the scanners that let you pay with services like Apple Pay.

Users can now use an app called Spedn to pay with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, or Gemini’s dollar-backed stablecoin called the Gemini dollar for items at retailers including Whole Foods, Regal Cinemas, Baskin-Robbins, Starbucks, and others, according to Fortune.

Will crypto-payments stick this time? The cryptocurrency industry has wanted to achieve mainstream adoption in retail for ages. A number of merchants tried to accept Bitcoin payments in the past, but it was probably too early: paying with crypto had yet to take off, and many retailers stopped taking it. In many cases that’s probably been down to price volatility and slow processing times.

Speed merchant: In this case, Flexa will serve as a bridge between merchants and the blockchain, and will settle the payments in real time using its own network. Merchants can choose to take the payment in either cryptocurrency or dollars. According to Gemini, processing payments like this will be cheaper than using credit card networks.

Hush hush: But all six merchants Fortune asked about the project refused to comment, and one person familiar with the project stated anonymously it is “experimental.” They said that participating retailers don’t want to discuss the project until they learn more about whether and how people will use it.

Flexa isn’t just offering crypto; it’s implemented a payment network that lets merchants accept crypto that settles in dollars (or crypto if the merchant prefers). The full press release is below, but here are the questions we have regarding this implementation.

Is Gemini Trust Company, LLC more reliable than all the other Exchanges that have either been operated by criminals or by incompetents. The amount of crypto lost and stolen by Exchanges makes it hard to trust any of them.

Where does Flexa hold the crypto? Is it held in the wallet, in cold storage someplace, in the Gemini exchange until spent? The press release states the user is to “. . . send bitcoin or other supported digital assets to the secure SPEDN wallet . . .”

Is the bitcoin private key held in the wallet?

How is the wallet secured?

What is communicated to the merchant?

How is the payment instrument (crypto, token, bar code, hash, whatever) secured in transit and protected against man in the middle attacks?

What network do the merchants connect their scanner to in order to accept the crypto? How is this network secured?

What network do merchants receive settlement for the transaction on? Is it net settlement? How frequently does settlement occur?

How do merchants reconcile Flexa transactions with its books?

What receipts and notifications do consumers receive?

What is the business model, who pays and who receives transaction fees?

Is there a dispute process in place for consumers?

What participant in this network holds the risk associated with crypto volatility?

How is the crypto volatility hedged? Bitcoin Cash transactions can take 6 hours.

The press release states that no POS upgrade is required, but certainly, POS software needs to be updated to recognize and route these transactions differently that say scanning a can of soup or a prepaid gift card.

This is a long list of questions and payment networks are complex to operate. I imagine there are mostly good answers to these questions in that these merchants clearly have the wherewithal to properly vet their suppliers and are incented to do so to protect their brand. We will be following this going forward but here is the full press release:

“NEW YORK, May 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — Flexa, the new global network uniting retail and blockchain technologies, today announced a limited launch of its network and mobile app to enable instant cryptocurrency payments in stores and online for several retail merchants. Beginning today, merchants can easily accept bitcoin, ether, Bitcoin Cash, and the Gemini dollar from consumers who have the new SPEDN mobile wallet app. The SPEDN app will be more widely available for download in the App Store starting next week.

To spend cryptocurrency on Flexa, consumers send bitcoin or other supported digital assets to the secure SPEDN wallet and scan the app’s barcode at the register, just like other forms of digital payment. Flexa then converts a consumer’s cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars in real time for payment to the merchant, enabling a simple exchange process and practical use of cryptocurrencies for real-world payments.

“This is the first real instance of decentralized global retail payments, with the power to make commerce more efficient and accessible for billions of citizens globally,” said Tyler Spalding, Co-Founder and CEO of Flexa. “The legacy payment systems are complicated and costly. This solution provides a way for cryptocurrencies to solve these problems and allow merchants to conduct inexpensive and fraud-resistant transactions.”

The SPEDN app was built on the open Flexa network, which acts as an intermediary between merchants and the blockchain, and requires no point-of-sale upgrades for merchants. By integrating existing merchant points-of-sale with blockchain technologies, Flexa’s network simplifies the payment settlement process and reduces instances of fraud, decreasing two of the most significant operating costs for retailers.

Payment processing costs have risen to nearly $90 billion and 2017 losses due to payment card fraud were reported at $22 billion globally.

In addition to simplifying the payment process, Flexa also announced its partnership with Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a regulated and secure cryptocurrency exchange and custodian to exclusively leverage the Gemini dollar. Consumers can spend their U.S. dollars on the blockchain without the price volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.

“This technology shifts cryptocurrency from investment and speculation toward real usability. You can finally buy a cup of coffee with cryptocurrency and a tap of your phone. This moves the broader ecosystem closer to realizing the full promise and power of crypto,” said Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini.

In 2018, Gemini launched the Gemini dollar, the world’s first regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin, under the direct supervision of its regulator the New York Department of Financial Services. Flexa customers’ assets will also be custodied by Gemini, providing an additional layer of security and regulation.

Overview by Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation at Mercator Advisory Group",2019-05-14 15:40:20+00:00,https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/whole-foods-nordstrom-other-major-retailers-cautiously-open-door-to-crypt/554745/,"Brief:

Whole Foods, Bed Bath & Beyond and Nordstrom are among the major retail brands now accepting in-store cryptocurrency payments via a Spedn mobile wallet app that launched Monday, which is built on the global payments network Flexa, according to a report in CBS News.

Users of Spedn can send their bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, ether and Gemini dollar digital currencies to the app and scan an app barcode in-store to complete a transaction, as Flexa explained in a news release. Flexa then handles converting the cryptocurrencies into U.S. dollars in real-time for the merchant.

The application is so far limited for use by attendees of Consensus, a cryptocurrency conference, per CBS News. Flexa said Spedn will become broadly available on Apple's App Store next week. Flexa also announced a partnership with Gemini, which claims to be the world's first regulated, dollar-pegged ""stablecoin"" — a digital token that's attached to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, to avoid the volatility that frequently rocks other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Insight:

Blockchain-based technology like cryptocurrencies have been hyped for several years, but concrete applications, particularly for the end consumer, have remained extremely limited. Wild fluctuations in the markets and the prevalence of fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have also made investors and users increasingly wary of sinking too much of their money into a space that promises greater security when it comes to financial transactions, with recent steep declines in value for key players like bitcoin signaling a potential die-off in interest for crypto overall.

Major retailers, which additionally include Lowe's, Regal Cinemas, Ulta and Baskin Robbins, now accepting crypto payments could revitalize digital tokens' bid for mainstream adoption and provide stronger mobile use cases for brands to glom onto as similar methods of conducting transactions in-store, like contactless payments, become popular. Spedn also touts advantages that could be an appealing draw for other businesses, including lower transaction fees and the lack of need to upgrade existing point of sale systems to facilitate the crypto payments.

""This is the first real instance of decentralized global retail payments, with the power to make commerce more efficient and accessible for billions of citizens globally,"" Tyler Spalding, co-founder and chief executive of Flexa, said in a press statement.

However, a degree of caution from retailers seems to be lingering over the Spedn launch, and the press release announcing the news lists none of the major partners accepting payments through the app. A report in Forbes details how representatives from both Gemini and Flexa were unable to get their clients to confirm their partnerships over email or talk on the record about the news. Forbes followed Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins made famous by ""The Social Network"" and the owners of Gemini, to a Starbucks location where one of the brothers completed a transaction using Spedn, but had to cover up the coffee chain's logo on the receipt when taking a photograph of it.

Forbes secured receipts that prove the payments are working with other brands like GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond and Whole Foods. Flexa data shared with the publication suggests that 89% of test users have leveraged Spedn's capabilities with at least one participating retailer.

Retail brands might be careful in officially attaching their names to Spedn's launch because the viability and security of cryptocurrency payments have yet to be proven at scale. But other developments suggest the crypto space could be receiving a second wind, which might be leading more companies to dip their toes back in the water. Facebook recently eased up a previously stringent policy on cryptocurrency ads and is also busy developing its own cryptocurrency-based payments — a potentially significant move as the platform pivots to focusing on private, encrypted messaging.",2019-05-14 10:17:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-altcoins-idUSKCN1SL0FC,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s weathered hacks, heists, booms and busts to reign as the king of cryptocurrencies through its first decade. But now there’s a fresh challenge to its dominance of the fledgling market: some 2,000 smaller digital coins.

Collectively, “altcoins” are gaining ground on their bigger cousin. Individually, they are gaining traction among users, gathering communities of developers and users often deeply devoted to their goals.

Bitcoin now accounts for around 60% of the $240 billion crypto market, down from nearly 90% just over two years ago. That fading dominance reflects tough times for the original cryptocurrency since its late 2017 apex.

Bitcoin has almost doubled in value this year, rallying nearly 30% in recent days to touch its highest level in ten months on Tuesday. But last year it lost three-quarters of its value.

That volatility has put off mainstream investors from pension funds to asset managers who are seen as crucial to bitcoin’s growth from speculative token to established asset.

Bitcoin has also struggled for traction as means of payment, its intended usage. Few but cryptocurrency diehards go shopping with the digital currency.

Enter the altcoins.

Binance Coin and Bitcoin Cash, Tether, Monero and Dash: The diversity of their names reflects myriad protocols and groups of users, traders and developers behind them.

They also suffer from high volatility and few are used for mainstream payments. But playing out in their growth is a slow-burn tussle that analysts and academics describe as a race to find the answers to bitcoin’s flaws. It’s one that could shape the evolution of cryptocurrencies and related technologies like blockchain.

The two biggest altcoins, Ethereum and XRP, together account for about a fifth of the coin market, with respective circulations of $22 billion and $17 billion. Others, with names like AnarchistCoin and CryptoPing, are illiquid and seldom used.

“Their proliferation is driven by the need to spark new innovation – security innovations, or a new algorithm that allows faster transaction to a new blockchain,” said Paolo Tasca, who runs University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies.

The emergence of a de facto “money of the internet” - a digital coin that is recognized and accepted online - is widely seen as a prerequisite for cryptocurrencies to break through into the mainstream.

Bitcoin, seen as the most likely to take that mantle, has mostly failed to live up to its billing.

Without doubt, it’s the most well-known of its kind. And to the extent they do look at cryptocurrencies, larger investors tend to gravitate towards bitcoin.

But its use in commerce is hamstrung by high transaction costs and low speed. And for all its proponents’ claims that it is “digital gold,” bitcoin’s volatility means that it is highly impractical as a store of value.

“Bitcoin was designed to be the money of the internet, but that was a very early idea,” said Hugo Volz Oliviera, an analyst at trading platform London Block Exchange. “Other projects have tried to fill the gap that exists.”

Some, like ethereum, power blockchain-based applications. Others, known as “stablecoins,” look to overcome the problems associated with wild price fluctuations by being pegged to fiat currency.

A bigger proportion still are essentially clones of bitcoin, offering little in the way of radically difficult uses. Some, such as Litecoin, are designed to tackle some of bitcoin’s weaknesses, such as slow transactions.

Bitcoin proponents point to initiatives such as the Lightning network - code that can be added to the blockchain that’s designed to make payments faster and cheaper - that could help it overcome its structural flaws.

And even as altcoins spread, high-profile supporters such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey see bitcoin maintaining its dominance. In an podcast released in February, Dorsey said bitcoin will become the internet’s native currency, given that it was born, developed and tested online.

PURE SPECULATION, OR BETS ON THE FUTURE?

Altcoins outperformed bitcoin by four percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Cumberland, a major cryptocurrency trader based in Chicago.

And if the burgeoning number of altcoins is a product of the technological hunt for answers to bitcoin’s weaknesses, investor interest can be seen as bets on which altcoin will gain ground for payments or transfers, or as a store of value.

“What you’ve had is a maturation of the altcoin market, and you’ve got investors and traders more comfortable understanding the fundamentals around what they’re buying,” said Bobby Cho, Cumberland’s chief operating officer.

Others say altcoin trading is mostly speculative, with investors interested less in the technicalities and communities of various coins than simply their potential to make money.

New York-based Grayscale, the world’s largest cryptocurrency asset manager that oversees assets worth $1.3 billion, said average weekly investments for the year to the end of March for altcoin products were $1.2 million, versus $3.9 million for bitcoin.

“There is no doubt that as investors become further drawn into the space, they do like to diversify into other digital assets,” said Michael Sonnenshein, its chief executive.",2019-05-15 06:19:29+00:00,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=da5725d8-05b9-4db4-b7c1-48b9022a986a,"One of the world’s largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, revealed this month that hackers had withdrawn over 7,000 Bitcoin in one transaction.

Lawyers Louisa Xu and Chelsea Payne detail what Binance has revealed of the hack.

On 7 May 2019, one of the world’s largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, revealed it had discovered a large scale security breach, with Hackers withdrawing over 7,000 Bitcoin (currently worth approximately AUD$70 million) in one transaction.[1]

It is reported that hackers used a variety of techniques including phishing and viruses to obtain a large number of user API Keys, two factor authentication codes and potentially other information in the attack.[2] Hackers used multiple seemingly independent accounts at the right time to pass existing security checks.[3] Binance was not able to withdraw the transaction before it was executed, but has since suspended all withdrawals until a security overhaul has taken place.[4]

The attack, consisting only of the one transaction, impacted only Binance’s BTC hot wallet, which contained about 2% of total Bitcoin holdings.[5] Binance stated that it will use its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an emergency insurance fund, to cover the incident in full.[6]

This isn’t the first time a cryptocurrency exchange has been hacked, with a number of high profile exchanges suffering from attacks. In 2011, the infamous Mt Gox hack announced more than 750,000 Bitcoins were missing from the exchange. Unfortunately for these investors, they were not reimbursed for their losses.

Binance has issued a further security incident update stating they are aiming to resume operations on 14 May 2019 after making significant improvements to their security systems.[7]",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-14/wild-crypto-market-s-traders-get-something-new-fdic-protection,"Why did this happen?

E-commerce giant eBay is currently not allowing payments to be made in cryptocurrency and is not working on that option at all at the moment, the company confirmed to Cryptonews.com.

Yesterday, speculations appeared in the cryptoverse that the California-based multinational e-commerce corporation will start accepting crypto as payment for the products sold on the site.

“Cryptocurrency is not accepted as a form of payment on the eBay platform, nor is it part of our payments strategy,” the company said, directing people to their Accepted payments policy site.

Indeed, nowhere on eBay’s site is the support of crypto even mentioned. The allowed forms of payment include PayPal, PayPal Credit, as well as credit card or debit card processed through the seller's Internet merchant account. Restricted category specifies that the platform doesn’t allow payments that occur outside of eBay pages (bank-to-bank transfers, checks, money orders, and online payment services), except in certain listing categories.

On its long list of not allowed methods of payment, the e-commerce giant clearly states: “Paying with Virtual or Cryptocurrencies.”

How did this all start then, and how did some portals and news sites across the world report it as a possibility, even discussing how paying in crypto would work on a site such as eBay?

Well, we know that a trader going by the username wolf (@ImNotTheWolf) tweeted the photos allegedly first published Sunday in the Telegram group “Patrons of the moon”. The photos seem to be eBay’s ads from the crypto conference Consensus in New York.

This news and all its implications, given its millions of active users, would’ve been massive if it were true. But, alas, it is not.

Cryptoverse, to their credit, was quick to recognize it such, calling the information false from the get-go, but some even going as far as accusing “the messenger” wolf of knowingly spreading false news with the intention to defraud the general public.

No, you are knowingly spreading misinformation to help defraud the public. pic.twitter.com/Qa26OFcIp1 — Don't ask (@berengerdcl) 13 May 2019

eBay explained the photos, clarifying the misunderstanding: “The ad is referencing the fact that eBay has a variety of virtual currency related items for sale on the marketplace, such as mining equipment.” Readers may also recall that this spring a crypto startup was sold on eBay.

However, it seems that it's only a question of time when crypto users will be able to pay with crypto on eBay. As reported in April, Moon, a crypto payment processing startup’s service, announced that Coinbase users can shop on Amazon by paying with crypto and said that other e-commerce websites, such as eBay, Ali Express and others might be supported soon, also.

Moreover, on the other side of this coin, many high-profile retailers, including Barns & Noble, Baskin Robbins, GameStop, Nordstrom, Regal, and Whole Foods, are now accepting payments in cryptocurrency, more specifically Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and stablecoin Gemini Dollar.",

All this despite a $40 million hack earlier that week, a call from a Nobel laureate to ban all cryptocurrencies, and continuing signals from the Securities Exchange Commission that regulatory guidelines on digital assets were imminent.

Yet the market apparently sloughed off the bad news after Fidelity Investments announced that it would launch Bitcoin trading on behalf of clients in coming weeks, serving notice to central bankers and old school economists that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and XRP are not going away.

That’s why the sooner agencies like the SEC start treating cryptocurrencies like the tools of exchange they are, and not a variant of stocks and bonds, the better for investors and the digital economy as a whole. More so when we consider the risks that siloed regulation of the cryptocurrency application will have on blockchain, the underlying technology infrastructure that supports it. Undercutting blockchain innovation would be disastrous not only for the future of finance but technology as a whole.

Bitcoin is not a security

Cryptocurrency is digital cash. While it has value, it neither represents an ownership share, as stock does, or a redeemable debt, as bonds do. While cryptocurrency is traded on the open market where its price can fluctuate, that does not make it a security. In fact, purchase and sale of Bitcoin is more like foreign currency exchange, which the SEC does not regulate.

Yet that has not stopped SEC Chairman Jay Clayton from hinting at classifying many cryptocurrencies as securities and placing them under rules that govern conventional securities trading, rules that won’t mesh with the healthy function of the cryptocurrency market and will likely hurt investors and damage cryptocurrency growth and utility.

Clayton justifies SEC mission creep in the name of protecting investors from market manipulation. While the Bitcoin market has been volatile, analysts have argued that data does not support claims of manipulation.

Consequences for blockchain

While the policy debate centers on cryptocurrency, hasty regulation will, by extension, adversely affect the development of blockchain, the network technology that makes cybercurrency work. In cryptocurrency applications, blockchain creates a virtual permanent ledger of transactions, distributed across the Internet. That distribution makes it difficult to impossible to tamper with the validity of Bitcoin or debauch or counterfeit the currency.

Beyond that, blockchain can do much to safeguard privacy and security of personal data on the Internet without decreasing the value of networked applications. For example, one of the toughest problems in health care is protecting the privacy of electronic health care records but allowing physicians to access those records in an emergency. Blockchain provides secure solutions in these situations.

Right now, the U.S. is a global leader in blockchain technology, thanks to much that has been learned from cryptocurrencies. But the Chinese are actively working to develop blockchain technology and corner the cryptocurrency market – particularly in mining Bitcoin. China has been a forceful opponent of transparency and privacy since the invention of the Internet, which has rapidly grown to combine artificial intelligence and ubiquitous wireless service. China is using these latest techniques to monitor and track citizens in unprecedented ways. The Chinese carrier Huawei already has more than 1,000 patents–37%–on Fifth Generation (5G) wireless, the core of the so-called Internet of Things. The U.S. is not alone in their concern about Huawei’s aggressive push to standardize 5G around its patents and exactly how Huawei, which has a history of ethical problems, will process the data it will collect from millions of interconnected sensors, cameras and devices. As the U.S. and China compete to develop next generation technologies blockchain stands to be a critical counterweight against abuse and is crucial that the U.S. remain the leader in blockchain innovation. That will require a U.S. regulatory framework that nurtures innovation, not hampers it.

Pointedly, China prohibits the use of cryptocurrency by citizens, but it tolerates massive server farms that now account for 74% of Bitcoin mining. While the Chinese government recently called for a ban on cryptocurrency mining, it has yet to give the decree the force of law. Even if it did, bureaucratic loopholes would prevent enforcement. This will only further centralize control over cryptocurrencies mined by the Chinese.

Preserving the U.S. position as a global leader in technological innovations is critical to maintaining our economic advantage with things we ourselves develop. That’s why the SEC’s attempt to place cryptocurrencies under decades old regulatory regimes is concerning. Such moves could have unintentional consequences beyond investment markets. The bullish market shows digital currency is becoming an accepted financial tool. Siloed approaches no longer work. Regulation needs to be thoughtfully crafted with the knowledge that in today’s digital economy pulling on one thread affects so many others.",2019-05-15 18:00:11+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-binance-restarting-services-after-post-hack-upgrade,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that it is back online after completing a security upgrade prompted by a recent hack.

Kicking off at 03:00 UTC Wednesday, the upgrade meant that all services were suspended during this period, according to a Binance support message. A two-hour extension to the upgrade was announced this morning as some tasks took “longer than expected.”

Following the upgrade, Binance published an update saying that trading will recommence at 13:00 UTC. Users can now cancel open orders and process deposits, while withdrawals “will be available shortly after trading resumes,” it said.

Deposits and withdrawals have been offline since the hack last week, which Binance said saw 7,000 BTC (worth about $41 million at the time) stolen from the exchange’s hot wallet. Exchange customers would not be affected by the losses, Binance said.

Following the breach, CZ said in a blog post that the exchange would make “significant” changes related to its application programming interface (API), two-factor authentication (2FA) and withdrawal validation to reduce the risk of future hacks.

The exchange did not disclose full details regarding these efforts due to security concerns, but did say it’s also improving risk management and know-your-customer procedures to fight phishing, among other measures at the back-end.

UPDATE – Zhao sent out an update noting that withdrawals “will be open shortly.”

“A new requirement to be logged in while confirming the withdrawal mail was added. It caused a small conflict while using the app so it will be rolled back shortly,” he wrote.

It tapered off slightly by mid-afternoon, but is still trading at its highest level in nearly a year.

What’s going on?

Bullish experts say the strong showing could signal that bitcoin has a future as a worthy investment opportunity. But the currency’s volatile and controversial history has prompted plenty of skepticism.

Bitcoin has typically been regarded as risky, said Dan Held, co-founder of Interchange, a company that advises businesses on how to manage their crypto assets. But he said the currency’s resurgence might be the first inkling that it holds weight as a “risk off” trade — an investment treated as a safer bet when markets are tumultuous, like bonds or gold. After all, the currency skyrocketed in value Monday when the Dow plunged 617 points, perhaps suggesting that investors turned to bitcoin as a safe haven asset.

“It’s bitcoin’s moment to shine when people momentarily give up on the government or the banking system,” Held added.

But the bitcoin rally didn’t end when the markets were plunging. The currency continued to climb early Tuesday even as the major indexes did well, and it held steady for much of the day.

That could have been because Monday’s bitcoin trading frenzy spurred additional investor interest, said James Putra, head of product strategy at brokerage firm TradeStation Crypto.

“When the market started to rise, it drew more people in,” Putra said. “Larger players started to take bites out of the marketplace; it’s a common and familiar approach.”

Still, bitcoin has been here before. It hit $20,000 in December 2017 before crashing the next year. Some experts called the downturn a correction after a period of “speculative mania.”

The currency also faced accusations of price manipulation: Two academics at the University of Texas at Austin studied the possibility bitcoin had been manipulated and said they found evidence that it had been during its massive 2017 run-up. The shadow of price manipulation continues to loom over bitcoin.

“Manipulation could very well be behind the recent market moves. To act like bitcoin and crypto currency prices are purely driven by supply and demand of little traders … ignores the specific mechanics of this marketplace,” said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin and one half of the duo that penned the paper on price manipulation last year.

“It would not be a stretch nor surprising to find that manipulative activity is behind the recent runup when the underlying market mechanics are similar to before,” Griffin added.

Griffin isn’t the only one with that suspicion.

“I don’t think anyone really knows what this is due to,” said Tim Massad, former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speaking about the latest rally. “But you worry that manipulation could be a contributing factor given the lack of regulation and transparency in this market compared to other markets.”

Massad said he lauded the Securities and Exchange Commission for stepping up oversight of cryptocurrency, but added that “you still have gaps in regulation.”

Another, simpler explanation for the price rise: It’s Blockchain Week, an unofficial holiday for bitcoin. The event, which is also called Consensus 2019, draws in more buyers for bitcoin and other major currencies, according to Lennon Sweeting, the director and head trader of Coinsquare, a Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform.

There’s also the fact that bitcoin and blockchain — the underlying technology that acts as a public ledger — have steadily become more mainstream. JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, announced a new digital coin earlier this year. JPMorgan and Microsoft recently announced plans to partner and expand on blockchain platforms. And ICE, the owner of the NYSE, launched a futures exchange for bitcoin and other cryptos.

All of that could make the digital currency and its technology appear more credible to investors. And it gives bitcoin’s backers a reason to remain optimistic.

“The $10,000 mark remains firmly in sight over the coming months,” said Vaibhav Kadikar, founder and CEO of a decentralized prediction market platform, CloseCross. “And the possibility of surpassing the previous high in the coming half year still remains.”",2019-05-15,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-protocol-successfully-upgrades-schnorr-signatures-are-here/,"Bitcoin Cash Protocol Successfully Upgrades — Schnorr Signatures Are Here

The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chain has officially upgraded, adding Schnorr signatures and the Segwit recovery exemption. As of block 582680, the chain has implemented the new features successfully and BCH fans are celebrating another major protocol improvement.

Also read: Schnorr Signatures Are Coming to Bitcoin Cash – Here’s What You Should Know

Another Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Achieved

On Wednesday, May 15, the Bitcoin Cash network has completed yet another successful upgrade by implementing two new features — Segwit recovery and Schnorr signatures. Essentially, the Segwit recovery addition makes it possible for network participants to recover funds that have been sent to Segwit addresses by accident. The implementation makes an exemption following the enforcement of the new CLEANSTACK rule that made Segwit recovery previously impossible after the upgrade last November. But the high profile feature everyone’s been chatting about is the implementation of Schnorr signatures, a digital signature scheme that allows for complex signing abilities.

The signature scheme was invented by Claus Schnorr and cryptocurrency developers have been looking into adding the scheme for years but it was patented. Now that the patent has expired, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developers ran with the idea and decided to add the preliminary basics of Schnorr signatures to the main chain. In conversation last week, developer Mark Lundeburg told news.Bitcoin.com that the basics of Schnorr signatures can slash roughly 4% off current transaction storage. In the future, after another Schnorr related upgrade, the scheme could provide for public signature aggregation and more complex sign-to-contract concepts.

Bitcoin Cash Using Schnorr Will Aid Privacy & Scaling

Further Schnorr related improvements can provide multiple parties with the ability to transact with simple multi-party aggregation schemes. Because Schnorr signatures are only 64 bytes in contrast to the traditional 70 bytes used by ECDSA signatures, initially people can take advantage of the 4% savings in regard to blockchain storage and bandwidth. But with further upgrades and the implementation of public signature aggregation, the entire network’s scaling abilities could be enhanced by reducing blockchain storage and bandwidth by at least 20-25%. When Schnorr is combined with concepts like pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) addresses and the recently added opcode OP_CHECKSIG, other benefits can be added to transactions like privacy and decision-based smart contracts.

As of today, after the initial implementation BCH developers will be able to build:

Payment channels hidden as ordinary payments.

Atomic swaps hidden as ordinary payments.

Lightning-style payment channel networks too, if desired.

Secure chains of unconfirmed transactions involving multiple parties (layer 2).

After the upgrade, the Bitcoin Cash community and developers celebrated the achievement and programmers like Gabriel Cardona and Mark Lundeberg processed the first Schnorr signature transactions on the main network. As of 12:10 p.m. EST there’s been 23 blocks processed under the new consensus rules. A few hours earlier, however, it seems an unknown entity attempted to exploit the chain with invalid transactions, which affected numerous Bitcoin ABC clients. A patch was then added to fix the issue within the client after being submitted by Amaury Séchet and reviewed by ABC developer Jason Cox. Developers have said that the exploit had absolutely nothing to do with the consensus upgrade itself and mining pools were notified of the mining bug immediately. While waiting for the patch, pools mined a succession of empty blocks up until block height 582697 and the chain began processing blocks normally.

The community is thrilled to see yet another successful upgrade and is pleased the added features will enhance the path toward providing the best peer-to-peer electronic cash system on the planet.

Speculation has been mounting since the e-commerce giant took out ads at the Consensus conference in New York City. One of the billboards said:

“Virtual Currency. It’s happening on eBay.”

It has been suggested that this week’s surge in crypto prices, which has happened without explanation, was linked to hopes that eBay was preparing to embrace crypto.

Given how the online auction site bills itself as “the world’s largest marketplace,” such a move would have been a major milestone in the industry’s quest to achieve mainstream adoption, Bloomberg reports. But addressing the rumors directly, an eBay spokesperson said:

“Cryptocurrency is not accepted as a form of payment on the eBay platform, nor is it part of our payments strategy.”

The online marketplace does currently have a section marked Virtual Currency, where people can use traditional monetary forms to purchase crypto from sellers.

The eBay clarification is not the only rumor that has been discredited over recent days. Excitement had started to build in the crypto community in April when a tweet suggested that TD Ameritrade, which holds an estimated $1.3 trillion in assets, was testing bitcoin (BTC) and litecoin (LTC) spot trading on its brokerage.

But Sunayna Tuteja, the company’s head of digital assets, told Bloomberg:

“Currently we’re not. We have what we call paperMoney, which is what our clients can try for trading strategies. It was a simulation. So there was no actual execution.”

Despite these denials, other major brands have confirmed this week that they will allow customers to spend crypto in their stores.

As the Bitcoin rally picked up momentum, the volume also spiked higher. Bitcoin futures on CME made a new record as the number of traded contracts reached 33,700 on May 13, which was way higher than the previous record of 22,500 contracts that exchanged hands on April 4. While increasing volume is a positive sign, a huge spike in volume can, at times, signal panic buying for the fear of missing out on the gains.

This is also a time when a number of rumors will crop up that can result in short-term spikes. One such rumor was that eBay will start accepting cryptocurrencies, but the same was denied by the company.

United States crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase has expanded operations in 50 more countries and has introduced USD Coin (USDC) trading in 85 more countries. While this increases the reach of cryptocurrencies. It also provides an opportunity to the people living in inflation-hit nations to escape devaluation of their fiat currencies. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its decision on the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application by Bitwise Asset Management.

Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, based on his personal experience in using Bitcoin for a real estate transaction, has termed the coin as a useless form of currency. We believe that as the markets mature, these troubles will be a thing of the past. Hence, people should look into the future rather than dwell in the past.

BTC/USD

After the sharp run-up of the past few days, Bitcoin (BTC) is taking a breather. It is facing some profit booking close to the overhead resistance of $8,496.53. The digital currency can either enter into a consolidation or a correction from these levels.

The first support on the downside is at $7,413.46 and if this level breaks, the slide can extend to the 20-day EMA. We expect one of these supports to stall the pullback. Both the moving averages are trending up, which shows that the BTC/USD pair is in a bullish grip. However, the RSI is deep in overbought territory, which suggests that buying has been overdone in the short term.

Traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $7,100. We will watch for the next two days and if the bulls fail to push the price above $8,496.53, we will suggest booking profits on the complete position. On the other hand, if the pair breaks out of $8,496.53, it can move up to $10,000.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) has picked up momentum in the past two days and has risen above our first target objective of $225. Though we like the way it has rallied, still we suggest traders book profits on 30% of their long positions at the current levels to pocket some gains and raise the stop loss on the remaining to $175, just below the 20-day EMA. If the price sustains above $225.49, the stops can again be raised to break even. The next level to watch is the pattern target of $256. If the momentum continues, a rally to $300 is also possible.

Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in the driver’s seat. Any dip is likely to find support at $200 and below it at the 20-day EMA. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair plummets below the 20-day EMA.

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) soared on May 14 and broke out of the overhead resistance of $0.33108 and $0.37835. This is a positive sign. It might face some profit booking close to $0.450 from where it might enter into a minor correction or a consolidation.

Any dip will find buyers close to $0.37835. We expect this level to hold and the XRP/USD pair to provide traders an opportunity to enter long positions. However, we will wait for a confirmation that the level is holding before proposing a trade in it.

On the upside, a breakout of $0.45 can clear the path for a rally to $0.60, with minor resistances at $0.50 and $0.55. At times, trades are missed because of large unexpected moves. It is a good trading strategy to wait for a low-risk entry point with a suitable stop loss and not chase the price higher.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently facing selling close to the resistance line of the ascending channel. A pullback to the 20-day EMA is a possibility. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the bulls have the upper hand.

A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel will be a positive sign and can result in a quick move to $500, followed by a rally to $638.99. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies, hence, these targets are achievable.

However, if the pair fails to break out of the channel, it might gradually continue to climb higher. It will weaken and slide to the support line of the channel on a breakdown of the 20-day EMA.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $91 on May 14. This completed a cup and handle pattern that triggered our buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.

The target level to watch on the upside is $158.91, with a minor resistance at $127.6180. The moving averages have turned up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. For now, the stop loss can be kept at $70.

We will watch for the LTC/USD pair to pick up momentum and quickly rally above $102, else the bears will again try to sink the pair back below the breakout level of $91. If the price slips back below $91, it will weaken the breakout. We may close the position if the price sustains below $91.

EOS/USD

EOS is looking strong as it has broken out of the overhead resistance at $6.0726. It can now climb to the next overhead resistance at $6.8299. If this level is also crossed, the digital currency is likely to pick up momentum. The 20-day EMA has started to slope up and the RSI has reached the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

If the EOS/USD pair fails to ascend $6.8299 in the first attempt, it might consolidate near the resistance for a few days or correct toward the 20-day EMA. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price slides below the strong support zone of $4.4930–$3.8723.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) made a new lifetime high on May 13, which failed to sustain. But it has again risen to new highs today. A cryptocurrency that breaks out to new highs with a strong move signals that there is more to come.

The BNB/USD pair can now move up to the resistance line where it is likely to face some selling. The pair had turned down thrice from this resistance line, hence, it is an important level to watch out for. Any dip will find support at the 20-day EMA.

Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has climbed into the overbought zone. This shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside. However, as we do not find a setup with a good risk to reward ratio, we are not proposing a trade in it.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has broken out of both the moving averages and the resistance at the long-term downtrend line. This points to an end of the downtrend. There is a minor resistance at $0.13250273 and if this level is crossed, the rally can extend to $0.14861760.

We find a developing inverted head and shoulders pattern on the XLM/USD pair. The pattern will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760. This gives the pair a target objective of $0.22466773, with a minor resistance at $0.17759016. We will wait for the price to sustain above $0.14861760 before suggesting a trade in it. However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $0.14861760, it might dip to the 20-day EMA once again.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) has been gradually inching higher towards the overhead resistance of $0.094256 for the past few days. If the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.094256, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275.

The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has also climbed into the bullish territory. This suggests that bulls have a minor advantage. The traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.094256. We will suggest a stop loss after the trade triggers.

On the other hand, if the bulls fail to ascend the overhead resistance of $0.094256, the ADA/USD pair might remain range bound for a few more days. It will turn negative on a break below the recent lows of $0.057898.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) has finally broken out of the range. If the bulls sustain the breakout, it will indicate the start of a new uptrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. As the digital currency had been consolidating for a very long time, we expect the next rally to last long and reach $0.050, with a minor resistance at $0.040.

Contrary to our assumption, if the TRX/USD pair fails to sustain above the range, it will extend its consolidation for a few more days. It will weaken on a breakdown of $0.02094452. The trend will turn negative if the bottom of the range at $0.0183 breaks down.

The news was announced Wednesday by Cryptopia’s assigned liquidator, professional services firm Grant Thornton New Zealand. Cryptopia confirmed the news on Twitter, as well as on its website.

Possibly signaling changes afoot, Cryptopia website went under maintenance yesterday without any message to the public on its social media platforms. It was first noticed by a Redditor who asked whether the exchange had been hacked again.

Back in January, Cryptopia went offline for a couple of days before stating mid-month that it had “suffered a security breach which resulted in significant losses.” A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the attack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost. Later, in March, the exchange restarted trading services, but still had banking issues.

Grant Thornton said the hack had a “severe” impact on the company’s trade, and despite the management’s efforts to reduce cost and return the business to profitability, it was decided that liquidation was the best path forward for all stakeholders.

David Ruscoe and Russell Moore from Grant Thornton will help Cryptopia secure its assets “for the benefit of all stakeholders,” according to today’s announcement.

“While this process and investigations take place, trading on the exchange is suspended,” Grant Thornton said, adding that the complex investigation will take “months rather than weeks.”

Commenting on Cryptopia’s Twitter announcement, numerous customers have expressed frustration that they were not allowed to withdraw funds since the hack, with some also calling for creditors to organize and take legal action against the exchange.

Ruscoe said:

“We realise Cryptopia’s customers will want to have this matter resolved as soon as possible. We will conduct a thorough investigation, working with several different stakeholders including management and shareholders, to find the solution that is in the best interests of customers and stakeholders.”

Grant Thornton is expected to file an initial report on the case next week on the New Zealand Companies Office website.

Nonetheless, some factors actually suggest that the new crypto bull run could be the biggest one yet.

Crypto prices have increased substantially during the last month

The past month has seen Bitcoin perform a dramatic climb from trading at below $5,100 to currently trading above $8,000. However, only looking at the performance of Bitcoin is too simplistic to measure the state of the entire cryptocurrency market.

Nevertheless, the rest of the cryptocurrency market has followed in the wake of Bitcoin’s price increases. In fact, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased from $172 billion to $254 billion during the past month.

This represents a market-wide increase of roughly 48% just during the last month. As such, several market observers have remarked that the crypto winter seems to finally be over. This means that people are increasingly beginning to look forward to the next crypto bull run.

When thinking about a cryptocurrency bull run, most would probably think about the intense cryptocurrency rally during late 2017. This particular green wave brought the price of Bitcoin to its all-time high of $20,000. Some experts are, therefore, predicting an eventual return to those levels.

The next crypto bull run could be the most massive one yet

However, the next crypto bull run could, in fact, potentially drive the price of Bitcoin even higher than $20,000. This is mainly because a lot has changed since late 2017. First and foremost, the public awareness of cryptocurrencies is substantially larger this time around.

Awareness is the first step towards acceptance and, ultimately, adoption. What’s more, FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out – could play a large part in fueling the next crypto bull run.

The market has already validated a $20,000 price point for Bitcoin at one time. This will likely entice casual investors to take part in the next Bitcoin rally, in the hopes of surpassing $20,000.

Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market’s long bear market trend has given cryptocurrency and blockchain firms the time to improve their fundamentals. This means that there is significantly more cryptocurrency infrastructure in place now than one and a half years ago.

The 2019 crypto market is more ready for bull run than it was in 2017

The co-founder of the crypto asset portfolio firm Interchange HQ, Dan Hedl, recently pointed this out on Twitter.

”In the last Bitcoin bull run we didn’t have Cash App, Fidelity, Etrade, TD Ameritrade, Bakkt, ErisX [or] Robinhood. Image what this bull run is going to look like!”

In addition to this, the next Bitcoin bull run could also benefit from investors looking to balance their stock portfolios. The stock market has been especially turbulent during the last week – due largely to the US-China trade war.

The cryptocurrency market, on the other hand, has continued to rise. Furthermore, the looming risk of a global economic crisis could further boost the price of cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies could be a safe haven during a stock market turndown

Cryptocurrencies compare to gold in being essentially ”immune” to the adverse effects of market turndowns. What’s more, gold is currently rising, and CNBC reports gold futures just settled at their highest point since April.

Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry now has substantially more educational content out there than in 2017. The Samsung Galaxy S10, one of the biggest mainstream phones of the year, has been equipped with cryptocurrency functionality.

Additionally, HTC just revealed a $300 smartphone with full Bitcoin node compatibility. These circumstances are conditions that cryptocurrency investors back in 2017 – when Bitcoin first hit $20,000 – could only dream about.

All of these factors are just some indications as to why the next crypto bull run could very well be the most massive one yet. As always, the markets are fickle and unpredictable so no one can know for sure – but it seems quite likely that the next cryptocurrency bull run could dwarf the last one.

Sources familiar with the matter reportedly told the Block that Coinbase has been vying with the digital currency wing of United States financial services giant Fidelity, Fidelity Digital Assets, for Xapo over the past several weeks to advance its custody business.

Following the closure of the deal, Coinbase will reportedly pay about $50 million in cash to Xapo, with a contingent earn-out for remaining with the company.

Founded in 2014, Xapo is a Hong Kong-based firm that provides a BTC wallet and a cold storage vault, as well as bitcoin-based debit card services. The company is backed by leading industry players such as venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Index Ventures, crypto investment companies Digital Currency Group, Winklevoss Capital and Blockchain Capital. Xapo reportedly holds $5.5 billion in assets under custody.

Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that Coinbase Custody managed to get $1 billion in assets under management in just 12 months after its launch. He also mentioned that 70 institutions signed up to the service during that period.

Coinbase officially launched its custody service for institutional investors in July of last year. At the time, the company revealed that it would enable its new institutional clients “to participate in the crypto ecosystem through proof of stake and distributed governance.” The company’s custody offering was set to be secured through a compliant and FINRA-member independent broker-dealer, Electronic Transaction Clearing (ETC).

This week, Coinbase made a massive expansion of USD Coin (USDC) trading to customers in 85 countries. Along with the USDC announcement, Coinbase also revealed a major global expansion, adding 50 more jurisdictions to its coverage, including such countries as Brazil, South Africa and Taiwan, among others.",,https://www.ccn.com/researcher-nears-launch-of-ava-a-crypto-potential-ethereum-killer/,"

Emin Gun Sirer is launching a new crypto Ava using the Avalanche consensus protocol that sounds a lot like Ethereum. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: The crypto ecosystem often explores which blockchain will emerge as the ‘Ethereum killer.’ So far, no network has been able to muscle the second-biggest blockchain off its perch, but now there’s a new kid in town – Ava, and it has Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Visa in its sights.

Ava is a new cryptocurrency that uses a consensus protocol known as Avalanche, whose creators similar to Bitcoin are anonymous only they go by Team Rocket. Avalanche is designed to combine the “best of both worlds” from the Nakamoto Consensus and Classical Consensus, according to Cornell University Associate Professor Emin Gun Sirer in a recent presentation.

Yes, a new coin, Ava, based on a new blockchain maintained by the Avalanche protocol. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) June 19, 2018

Bitcoin transactions take 10 minutes or more to be completed, and Ethereum can handle about 15 transactions per second, though both are feverishly scaling. Avalanche is designed to deliver “two-second” payments and thousands of transactions per second, which could catapult crypto microtransactions into the mainstream. The new protocol is also designed to scale “from 10,000 nodes up to 10 million nodes,” Sirer said in a recent presentation. Scalability is an issue that has plagued the Ethereum network.

Sirer is close to launching the new cryptocurrency and network based on Avalanche, according to a Bloomberg report. The network that the academic describes sounds a lot like what Ethereum 2.0 is becoming. Much like Ethereum, a variety of applications can also be built on top of it.

Sirer, who is also co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts, described to Bloomberg a platform that sounds a lot like Ethereum’s use case as an ICO platform. In addition to the native Ava cryptocurrency, the Ava platform can host other tokens for industries such as real estate, for example. He told Bloomberg:

“You can create a digital asset on top of Ava, a coin X. And then you can say, I want my coin to support Bitcoin transactions as well as Zcash – you can mix and mash features from different languages. And I want these features to be supported on this set of nodes.”

Ava Labs Has Already Raised Millions

Sirer is behind blockchain startup Ava Labs, which earlier this year attracted $6 million to its coffers from some major venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz. Ava Labs has reportedly unveiled a test version of the Ava network. The coin will reportedly launch soon.

Ava vs. Ethereum

So does it have the makings of the ‘Ethereum killer’ that the crypto ecosystem has been clamoring about? We don’t even know if that is what Sirer’s intentions are. We didn’t hear back from him in time for publication. But he did say in the recent presentation that Avalanche has “some huge big technical insights and technical progress compared to everything that exists today.” And he is launching a network that does everything that Ethereum already provides, from contracts to token support to app development.

Ethereum has a giant headstart from Ava and already boasts brand recognition around the world, not to mention the famous co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin. Sirer is also very respected in the community, and his new Ava coin and blockchain are sure to make an impact. But Ava is also brand new.

In a best-case scenario, they will thrive and also place fire under the feet of Ethereum developers to accelerate the evolution of the network.",2019-05-16 23:30:13+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/local-bitcoin-com-aims-to-spread-economic-freedom-through-p2p-exchange-of-bch/,"Local.Bitcoin.com Aims to Spread Economic Freedom Through P2P Exchange of BCH

On June 4, Bitcoin.com is launching a peer-to-peer marketplace called Local.Bitcoin.com that will allow users from around the world to buy and sell bitcoin cash (BCH). Now crypto enthusiasts and traders can create a pre-launch account to explore the trading platform and create orders on the exchange in advance.

Local.Bitcoin.com: Creating a Pre-Launch Account and Experimenting With the P2P Marketplace

At Bitcoin.com we believe that the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will revolutionize the world of money and give global citizens the true taste of economic freedom. BCH is a decentralized system that allows anyone to transact in a permissionless fashion for less than a fraction of a U.S. penny in fees. In order to add more accessibility and liquidity to the BCH ecosystem, Bitcoin.com is launching the peer-to-peer marketplace Local.Bitcoin.com. The trading platform will allow individuals to purchase and sell bitcoin cash (BCH) either locally or internationally. This week we’ve decided to open pre-launch accounts so users can sign up and test the platform’s features.

To create a pre-launch account in readiness for the official peer-to-peer BCH marketplace to open, sign up here. You’ll be asked for a username and password and then informed that the web browser will generate a private key offline. The interface then encrypts it using AES256-CBC to a PBKDF2-stretched version of your password. This means that Bitcoin.com staff cannot access the wallet and you will need to keep your password secure. Due to the nature of client-side encryption, there is absolutely no way for Local.Bitcoin.com staff to recover a lost password. After the username and password are entered, the platform will send a confirmation email and then grant you access to the exchange dashboard.

Right now Local.Bitcoin.com will provide access to your profile settings, the BCH wallet which allows for sending and receiving, and the ability to create a sell offer. In the profile section, you can edit your username, add a blurb about yourself, change email, edit two-factor authentication settings, and add a mobile phone number. You can also begin by creating an offer and having it all set up for the official opening day on June 4, 2019. The interface will ask if you want to buy or sell BCH whereupon you can select the appropriate option. From here, Local.Bitcoin.com will request a display location, providing an array of local choices or the option to add a custom region. Then you simply choose a payment method from the various choices available. Payment methods for Local.Bitcoin.com include cash (in person trades), bank transfers, bank deposits, Paypal, Moneygram, international wire, Western Union, gift cards, Payeer, Venmo, Skrill, and Transferwise.

After choosing a payment method, you can select a local currency, so if you’re located in the U.S. you’ll probably be choosing USD. From here, you can set the exchange rate, which could be a ‘dynamic market price’ or a more complex ‘custom equation.’ With the ‘dynamic market price’ choice, you can pick a percentage margin above or below the market price of bitcoin cash. For example, you can set the price of 1 BCH and sell it for 2% less than the current market price. Or with the ‘custom equation’ setting, you can customize the exchange rate by pulling data from an array of well known exchanges. An example of this equation would be selling for the highest bid for 1 BCH on Coinbase or Kraken with a custom floor. After the price is set, Local.Bitcoin.com will then ask you to confirm the selling price and make sure the settings are acceptable.

A Custom Trading Experience, Blind Escrow System, Bulk Trades, and Finding the Best Margin

Following confirmation, you can then set a limit or a minimum trade size in your local fiat currency. You can also create an offer headline and write a few terms of the trade offer in any manner you desire. Traders can set the offer so anyone can trade with them or they can decide to deal with people who have verified their phone number. After selecting either anyone or just users with a verified mobile number, the platform will ask you to confirm all the terms of the trade. Everything previously selected will be shown above the confirmation tab and you can change any of the settings if there was a mistake along the way. After confirming that everything was correct, simply hit the yellow confirmation button and the offer will be located on the main trade board and the accountholder’s dashboard. You can view the offer, pause it, and edit the trade again even after it was submitted. In addition to this, all trades are safeguarded by our blind escrow, a system that allows for a secure trading environment.

Using Local.Bitcoin.com is a breeze and it takes only a few minutes to set up a trade offer. At Bitcoin.com, we’re thrilled to be able to give people the ability to buy and sell bitcoin cash which will, in turn, bolster the decentralized currency’s infrastructure. Moreover, the peer-to-peer marketplace allows people to trade with each other on a more personal level, rather than dealing with a cold third party exchange. Often times traders can purchase BCH cheaper using an over-the-counter market, which allows users to buy digital assets in bulk and find the best margins available. Unlike with large exchanges, users don’t have to share intimate personal details and traders can begin swapping BCH instantly. So if you are interested in a peer-to-peer platform that allows anyone in the world to buy and sell bitcoin cash, check out Local.Bitcoin.com today and create a pre-launch account now.

While not many major crypto exchanges have closed their operations in the past year, most exchanges — with the exception of some platforms considered to have real daily volumes by Bitwise Asset Management — have struggled to maintain a stable inflow of revenue.

The bear market was particularly difficult for small exchanges that are known to strategically inflate their volumes to appeal to users on leading market data platforms like CoinMarketCap.

Profit margins sharply dropped due to an overall drop in daily volumes for smaller exchanges such as Korbit in South Korea, creating a difficult environment to survive in.

Cryptocurrency exchanges generate the overwhelming majority of their revenues through fees that occur when trades are executed. When daily volumes of crypto assets drop, exchanges suffer a dip in revenue.

Top crypto exchanges in South Korea have reported contrasting results for April, with Upbit pulling in over $110 million in profit and Bithumb suffering over $150 million in losses.

Why crypto exchanges suffered during the bear market, especially in South Korea

According to a report from The Block, Binance generated a quarterly profit of around $71 million from January to March 2019, nearing the annual operating profit of Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange.

Upbit is the only exchange among the top five cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea’s local crypto exchange market to record a profit in 2018.

Bithumb recorded a net loss of $175 million, and other leading platforms like Coinone and Korbit also recorded relatively large losses in 2018 to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.

Although a Bithumb representative told MK, a mainstream media outlet in South Korea, that the business of the exchange remains solid, a $175 million loss could have been critical for the exchange if it had not reportedly secured around $190 million in new funding:

""Even during a phase in which the cryptocurrency market is struggling, Bithumb is sustaining a solid business with unique services and global market dominance. Bithumb will put in all efforts in protecting user funds.”

Other challenges: no new registrations

2018 was particularly hard for exchanges in South Korea because exchanges were prohibited from accepting new registrations for awhile. As such, exchanges experienced a substantial decline in revenues.

Last year was challenging even for Upbit, the country’s dominant leader in the cryptocurrency exchange market.

A representative of Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit, said that the exchange was able to operate healthily throughout 2018 due to the company’s strategy of reducing marketing efforts and resources by employing a cautious approach in management.

“In comparison to other exchanges, Upbit operated with caution by reducing marketing efforts and overall manpower because new registrations were blocked. Most of the revenues recorded by Upbit in 2018 were generated in the first quarter of 2018 when the cryptocurrency market was hot. Upbit actually recorded an increase in revenues and operating profit since 2017.”

For smaller platforms like Coinnest, it was virtually impossible to expect any substantial operating income because of the sentiment around the market and the state of the cryptocurrency exchange market in South Korea.

Coinnest specifically suffered more than others due to the exchange’s reported $5 million mishap in January, during which the exchange mistakenly sent more than $5 million to clients.

Moreover, on Oct. 18, the former CEO of Coinnest was sentenced to three years in prison and a $2.6 million fine for fraud and for extracting user funds for personal financial gain. According to court documents, the former CEO and two other executives stole more than $30 million from users and reportedly faked around $400 million in volume.

Ultimately, citing regulatory uncertainty and a drop in crypto trading volume, a Coinnest representative said that the exchange was forced to close, a fall from grace for an exchange that was once the third biggest in the local market. The exchange’s representative said:

“It is a natural result of a decrease in trading volume. Both regulatory issues and business decisions have served as a background for this decision.”

Even big firms like Coinbase struggled

Small exchanges across major markets like Japan and South Korea often get acquired by larger companies or declare bankruptcy because of their focus on short-term profitability.

For exchanges, a strong network effect is crucial for sustainability. Hence, apart from the top five exchanges in every major region, most exchanges consistently struggle to generate profits.

In a bear market, the situation gets worse for both small and large exchanges, as seen in the performance of Coinbase in 2018.

On April 18, Reuters reported that Coinbase recorded an annual revenue of $520 million in 2018, which would normally be considered a healthy figure coming off of a brutal 85% correction of crypto assets.

But, Coinbase is one of the biggest exchanges in the global market, and it failed to reach its projection by 60%:

Net revenues of 520 million dollars with a ~40%+ profit margin for the year of 2018 is beyond excellent! Congratulations @coinbase team. — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) April 18, 2019

Bloomberg said in October 2018 that Coinbase expected an annual revenue of $1.3 billion in 2018 despite the correction of the market. Given that the document was obtained by Bloomberg late last year, it is likely that the last quarter was distinctly agonizing for exchanges.

Coinbase missed its annual revenue projection by a staggering 60% even with the continuous efforts of the exchange to increase the volume of the platform through the addition of new tokens and crypto assets.

Throughout the past two years, major exchanges in strictly regulated markets, such as the United States, refrained from prematurely listing tokens due to regulatory uncertainty around the nature of tokens.

In April alone, Coinbase listed tokens from Maker (DAI), Augur (REP) and EOSIO (EOS) on Coinbase Pro, following the listing of Stellar’s lumens (XLM) and the highly anticipated support for XRP, the cryptocurrency developed by Ripple.

The Coinbase team said after listing lumens in March:

“One of the most common requests we receive from customers is to be able to trade more assets on our platform. With the recent announcement of our new listing process, we anticipate listing more assets over time that meet our standards.”

Which other exchanges have shut down?

In South Korea alone, there are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges, with some reports estimating the number of exchanges in the country surpasses 100. Most of these exchanges are small companies that aim to drive short-term profits with aggressive token listings.

Due to a lack of resources, when minor exchanges are hit with security breaches, hacking attempts or a drastic drop in trading volume in the cryptocurrency exchange market, they are unable to cope with changes in market conditions.

Throughout the past 16 months, exchanges like Coinnest, Coinpulse and Liqui have shut down as a result of liquidity issues, and bigger platforms including QuadrigaCX, Coincheck and Zaif have closed following high-profile security breaches.

While Coincheck and Zaif have reopened in Japan with the approval of the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the two firms needed a lifeline from bigger conglomerates to fully compensate all user funds.

Zaif reopened on April 19 after securing a deal with Fisco worth around $44.5 million to compensate users affected by the hack.

“After that, on condition of financial support of approximately 5 billion yen, transfer of Zaif business from Tech Bureau Co., Ltd. to us was decided. In addition, we have asked customers via the Internet and by telephone etc. for the procedures for consenting to business succession,” Fisco team said.

Why small exchanges are always vulnerable

Small exchanges often fall victim to hacking attacks because compliance and security cost a significant sum of money. Well-regulated platforms like Gemini have insurance, in-house security experts and regular audits in place to secure user funds. But small exchanges cannot afford similar resources as major companies.

Even Coincheck, which was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, did not have proper in-house security experts to oversee the platform:

Main takeaways from Coincheck press conf:

- only NEM impacted

- plans to continue operating, restart trading

- not clear on plan to repay customers

- no multisig💀

- wouldn’t admit security was weak

- not sure how hacked, if domestic or foreign hackers

- CEO barely spoke — Yuji Nakamura (@ynakamura56) January 26, 2018

Former Coincheck CEO Koichiro Wada said in April 2018:

“We were aware we didn’t have enough people working on internal checks, management and system risk. We strived to expand using headhunters and agencies, but ended up in this situation.”

Although an investigation is said to be ongoing in the QuadrigaCX scandal — during which Gerald Cotten, the CEO of the exchange, lost $190 million in crypto and other funds after he reportedly passed away with private keys — the Coinbase team speculated that QuadrigaCX may have also been affected by the bear market and faced liquidity issues. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, said:

“QCX was one of the oldest exchanges in existence (founded in 2013). If they planned an exit scam, it likely would have been timed better. They suffered a multimillion dollar bug in June 2017. This is when we start to see movement of funds to ‘cold storages.’”

Patterns of sends from cold storage suggest they tried keeping the exchange afloat, and maybe attempted to trade their way out of the hole. Liquidity dried out and the bear market of 2018 may have caught up with them. The sequence of events suggests this was a mismanagement with a later attempt to cover it up.

Exchange closures will decline as the industry matures

The crypto bear market is crucial because it allows the industry to settle down, reflect, escape the speculative mania phase and rebuild the infrastructure around the market.

During an extended correction, the prices of crypto assets plummet and the volume of the market drops, leaving many low-quality projects and exchanges with a few options.

The cycle of the crypto market of speculation-correction-build-rally improves the quality of the industry and focuses the resources, capital and labor within the sector to quality companies.",,https://www.coindesk.com/just-376-individuals-hold-33-of-all-ether-cryptocurrency-chainalysis,"A third of all ether, ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, is owned by just 376 whales as of May 1, new research indicates.

Blockchain analysis startup Chainalysis published a study on Wednesday, indicating that, while these 376 individuals control 33 percent of the circulating supply in 2019, that number is actually down from levels seen in 2016 and 2017.

The study also found these whales have “no meaningful” impact on the ETH price, but they do increase intraday volatility in the cryptocurrency market when they make large sell-offs.

Chainalysis defines whales as the top 500 holders of cryptocurrency, excluding services, who store their holdings off exchanges. It found that ether whales currently account for just 7 percent of all transaction activity.

The study further found that the majority (around 60 percent) of these whales are not active traders, meaning they are holding their assets and are not regularly trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.

That means they consistently hold 25–40 percent of the circulating supply of ETH and account for only 5-18 percent of transaction volume, Chainalysis said.

Further, using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, commonly used in financial time series analysis, Chainalysis found that ETH prices follow bitcoin (BTC) prices. That is, on average, a 1 percent increase in BTC price yesterday leads to a 1.1 percent increase in ETH price today. The study, however, did not find a “statistically significant” impact of BTC prices on ETH’s intraday volatility.

The study also analyzed the impact of whales sending and receiving funds to and from exchanges using a VAR model. It found that funds sent do impact volatility but not price, while funds received have no impact either on prices or intraday volatility.

“These preliminary findings are consistent with the literature on stock market prices and volatility,” Chainalysis concluded. “Academics have found that large anomalous fluctuations in traded volumes of particular stocks, notably the S&P 500, tend to impact volatility and not price levels.”

The Estonian government’s Ministry of Finance introduced changes to the licensing process on May 3. The new regulations adds a numbered formal obligation, extends the processing time from 30 to 90 day and establishes the requirement for a company or branch to be incorporated in Estonia.

Furthermore, the registered office address and the board of directors now needs to be located in Estonia, and the state fee for the emission of the license has been increased from €345 ($386) to €3,330 ($3,729). The country’s minister of finance, Martin Helme, explained the reasons behind the change:

“We have learned our lesson from the banking sector the hard way, and we must now deal with new international risks, with cryptocurrencies among the most urgent of these.”

Eesti Consulting OÜ claims that it will be hard to obtain a cryptocurrency license now with the new regulations. Current license holders will reportedly have time until the end of the year to fulfill the new requirements, otherwise their license will be withdrawn by the regulator.

As Cointelegraph reported in December last year, the Estonian Ministry of Finance already announced at the time that it would have added amendments to a recently-passed financial bill in order to tighten crypto-related regulation.

Last week, Cointelegraph also wrote that Germany plans to introduce draft regulations allowing blockchain bonds as soon as this summer.",,https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-debit-card-margin-trading/,"

By CCN.com: Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong conducted a live YouTube AMA today from the company’s New York offices. Presumably, he’s in town for blockchain week, which brought him away from the San Francisco headquarters.

Armstrong answered several questions in the session, beginning with one regarding “community trust ratings” for altcoins. Armstrong said that crypto is much like the internet: as more options emerge, better mechanisms of finding the actual high-quality projects need to come along. He pointed out that Yahoo began by manually indexing the web, but later things like PageRank started. He likened the experience to shopping and the issues associated with customer reviews.

“The most important thing to understand about the cryptoeconomy is that we’re not simply righting the wrongs of finance 1.0. We’re creating an entirely new way to access financial services.” @brian_armstrong shares his vision for the future of cryptoeconomy from #consensus2019 pic.twitter.com/NOg3XbEt3V — Coinbase (@coinbase) May 15, 2019

Margin Trading Eventually Coming to Coinbase Pro

Then a much more interesting discussion came up around margin trading. Armstrong said that as far as he knows, it’s one of the most requested features. He said a lot of exchanges are offering leveraged trading and doing well with it, “so there’s clearly a market demand for that.” When it comes to providing such a product to consumers, there are regulatory issues to consider. Coinbase is aiming to become a global exchange, which means it’s best products will have to meet the lowest common denominator of regulatory standards. He told viewers that it’s something they’re considering, but there’s no real movement on it yet.

“This is one of those products where you have to innovate not just on the technology, but also on the regulatory side.”

Coinbase Card Expanding to the U.S.

Armstrong confirmed that the Coinbase card, which is available in the UK currently, will be available in the U.S. But he could not reveal when. Coinbase has previously offered a crypto debit card.

He had some revealing things to say about Coinbase’s fraud prevention program.

Answering a question about why there is a five-day hold on GBP-based accounts, Armstrong said:

“Unfortunately, there’s people out there who trade in stolen bank accounts and credentials, and they often come and try to use them. That’s why in actually making a fiat-to-crypto exchange, one of the hardest things to do is fraud prevention, in addition to the security and regulation. We put holds up there because we’re waiting to see if we get chargebacks from fraudulent accounts. The fraud rate is something we measure really carefully, because it ever gets out of hand, I mean, it can wipe our entire margin from the fee that we charge for these things. “Fiat-to-crypto through these kinds of reversible payment methods is a really difficult and expensive business. It’s part of why I’m so excited about crypto, because if you’re in a world where people have crypto in the future, a lot of these problems go away. For instance, you can make an irreversible transaction where it makes sense, or you can do the payment in real time, where it arrives in a few seconds instead of two or three days.”

There Will Be a Token for Pretty Much Everything

According to Armstrong:

“A directory kind of works when there are less than 100 or less than 1,000 of something, but quickly the number of pages on the internet grew to be in the millions and then billions. So you needed search engines, and you need things like PageRank to try to surface the best results.”

He went on to say:

“Another analogy is Amazon.com, which has millions of products. There might be a product that has two out of five stars, and you can decide if you want to buy it or not, but the best products get surfaced to the top once there are millions of something. And we are moving to a world where there’s going to be probably five or six major cryptocurrencies that are doing a lot of the payment volume, but there’ll be millions of tokens out there. One for every company, or project, or community, or non-profit. “So we’re very quickly going to end up in a world, and you can see the beginnings of this – Coinbase has asset pages, where you can go read a little bit of information about each different type of asset out there, but you can see a world very quickly where those need to have ratings and reviews, and some kind of equivalent like PageRank, where it looks at maybe hundreds of factors to try and surface best assets out there when you search for something. It’s not just companies. You’re going to see assets issued for specific funds where people want to raise money, all kinds of security tokens and stuff like that.”

Armstrong hinted that Coinbase may soon have improved price alerts for the assets that it lists, but they haven’t rolled that feature out yet because they don’t want it to be “annoying.”",2019-05-16 17:45:15+00:00,,,

This coincides with the slow roll-out of their internal cryptocurrency that will define the company’s first foray into blockchain technology.

Facebook Global Holdings is a stockholder in the new company and it will, according to Reuters, “provide financial and technology services and develop related hardware and software, plans submitted on the Swiss register reveal.”

Facebook’s march towards crypto has been slow and steady. The company’s latest move, the hiring of two Coinbase compliance managers, happened on May 14.

The Libra project has ruffled some feathers in Congress, as well. US lawmakers sent an open letter to the company seeking clarification on the currency’s purpose and implications.

They wrote:

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Facebook is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to help launch a cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network. Last year, Facebook asked U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about consumers. In addition, privacy experts have raised questions about Facebook’s extensive data collection practices and whether any of the data collected by Facebook is being used for purposes that do or should subject Facebook to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Crypto.com’s first new offering, Crypto Earn, gives the public “the freedom to grow their assets.” Available through the platform’s flagship app, the service allows users to deposit virtual currencies and accrue incentives, the company said. Consumers can choose to hold their assets for either one month or three months, and the company said a flexible plan will follow in the future.

The Hong Kong-headquartered company, which was founded in 2016, has also launched a second product called Crypto Credit. This service is designed to help users unlock spending power and monetize crypto assets without selling them — potentially helping borrowers to ride out price volatility in the marketplace.

Once a loan is taken out, borrowers are allowed to set their own repayment terms within a 12-month period, as well as avoid monthly late fees and deadlines. No credit checks are required for consumers to use this service, and the website says that it offers a loan-to-value ratio of 40% on bitcoin.

Loans are paid out in stablecoins, and the funds can be loaded onto Crypto.com’s MCO Visa Card to spend on everyday goods and services.

Crypto.com is available here

Kris Marszalek, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said: “MCO Visa Card, Crypto Earn, and Crypto Credit together form a powerful product suite that nobody else in the industry has today. We've never been more excited about the potential of our platform and look forward to continue scaling it globally later this year.”

Crypto Earn and Crypto Credit are available to users who have already been approved to use the Crypto.com Wallet and Card app — with the exception of residents in Singapore, Switzerland, Malta, the United States and Hong Kong. The company said efforts are underway to make the services available in these areas.

Collectively, the company said it is offering a modern approach to financial services — offering a crypto-focused alternative to banks that lend and accept deposits.

Positive feedback

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Crypto.com’s MCO Visa Card offers cashback benefits that are meant to appeal to modern consumers and frequent flyers. Depending on the tier of subscription they choose for the card, consumers have the potential to benefit from free Netflix and Spotify subscriptions as well as cashback on all purchases, and additional rebates whenever bookings are made on the likes of Expedia and Airbnb.

When the new cashback features were unveiled back in March, Crypto.com’s CEO said the company had received “hugely positive feedback” from customers in Singapore, with the platform setting its sights on shipping its cards to customers in Europe, the U.S. and other markets.

Earlier in May, Crypto.com announced that it had officially received an ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification following “rigorous third-party security audits.” The platform claimed it is “the first cryptocurrency wallet application to achieve this coveted accreditation,” and its chief information security officer claimed in a blog post that “the certification demonstrates that cybersecurity and privacy are embedded into Crypto.com’s DNA.”

Meanwhile, new coins and tokens have been added to the Crypto.com Wallet and Card app as the company strives to welcome users from across the community. Recent introductions include Enjin’s ENJ Coin — commonly used by gamers — along with the Basic Attention Token, an addition that is set to benefit an estimated 6 million people who actively use the Brave browser.

Bitcoin is an amazing form of money and the technology Satoshi created has incredible potential. However, most people don’t realize that the blockchain not only allows for a great medium of exchange, but it also provides the means for creating notarized proofs. The following walkthrough aims to show anyone how to prove they own a bitcoin cash address as long as they are the owner of the private key.

Also Read: Putting an End to the Bitcoin Store of Value Fallacy

The Bitcoin Cash Blockchain and Notarized Proof

The decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin cash (BCH) not only provides people with the means of permissionless exchange with extremely low fees, but it also can help verify the owner of a specific BCH address. It also means that notarized proofs can be managed on the BCH blockchain, but today for simplicity sake we’re just going to deal with proving ownership of a specific BCH address, as long as you possess a private key.

With a private key, an owner can create a message like “I own this address,” show the public address, and provide a valid signature which essentially proves ownership of the address. In order to get started and test a public address, download the latest version of Electron Cash. The light client is a reliable BCH wallet that comes with a tool that allows you to sign messages and prove address ownership. There are also other cryptocurrency wallets that provide signing and verifying tools as well.

After downloading Electron Cash, open it on your desktop and create a new wallet. Following the new creation of a BCH wallet, navigate to the top of the screen and find the Tools section and from there select the Sign/verify message. At this point, you will see a pop-up window that provides three sections and at first, you will provide just the message and a valid BCH address to complete the signing process.

From here simply press sign and the wallet will provide a long alphanumeric string and you can copy and paste this signature. If your Electron Cash wallet uses a password, the software will prompt you to enter it before signing the message. Now the combination of these three things will allow you to verify the message and the signature. Another person cannot sign with the address unless they hold the private key and if its password protected it’s even harder to steal.

Verify the Integrity of the Digital Signature

Close the pop-up window after you have copied the message, address, and the alphanumeric string (signature). You can then open the Sign/verify message window again, but this time just press the verify tab, after entering the same exact text (message – public address – signature) into the three sections. You can then press verify and if all the information is correct, the wallet software will validate the integrity of the message and ownership of the address.

Moreover, other people can verify the integrity of the message and signature as well with different types of wallets and alternative software. So after you’ve created a unique message, you can give it to friends, family or to anyone in the world and show them the notarized proof. Remember, all the person needs to provide a notarized message proving ownership of a specific BCH address is:

The Message

The BCH address

The Signature — (a long alphanumeric string much longer than an address), a signature tied to an address cannot be completed without private key ownership.

This method of proving ownership can come in handy for many reasons because only the person with a private key associated with the signature can prove they own the BCH address. Proof of ownership helps bolster things like proving existence with a message and notarizing certain data and making it impossible to forge. Back in 2017, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange used a message on the BTC chain to prove existence and that he was still alive.

In fact, the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto monicker could prove he/she is Bitcoin’s creator by providing a legitimate message and signature tied to one of Nakamoto’s known addresses. The private key associated with the signature makes it so no one can create a signed message with your address on your behalf without that key. Learning to sign and verify with a bitcoin cash address is easy and only takes a few minutes to understand the basics.

An industry? An entire movement?

This is perhaps too much meaning to attribute to any one design, but if any logo has come close to the task, it’s that of bitcoin.

Belonging to no corporation, no in-house graphic design team at a shiny Silicon Valley startup, bitcoin’s logo has given the faceless project’s many adherents an image to hold on to. And not only to hold on to – but to emblazon on shirts, stick to laptops and stamp on physical coins – giving the digital project a material existence that has been crucial for its propagation.

Perhaps more importantly, the collaborative development of bitcoin’s unofficial logo framed its encounter with the rest of the world.

In creating a symbol that resembled those of other currencies, bitcoin was visually introduced to newcomers as money. And in elaborating this symbol into a logo that could reside alongside Visa and Mastercard stickers on shop windows, bitcoin was simultaneously and distinctly established as a payment method.

But bitcoin’s current logo is far from its first.

The story of the bitcoin logo, much like the cryptocurrency itself, is one of evolution, one of facelifts, community collaboration and – occasionally – of controversy.

January (or March?) 2009

The earliest iteration of the logo was rendered by pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto himself shortly after the software’s launch and featured a BC on a gold coin.

Little is known about the original logo, as its creation predated the popular Bitcoin Talk forum. However, it is notable that in imitating the appearance of a gold coin, the icon references metallism. This monetary system, in which the value of money is derived from the exchange value of the commodity on which it is based (like gold or silver), is an ideal to which many bitcoin enthusiasts subscribe.

Within Bitcoin Talk, it’s difficult to tell whether users appreciated the original icon or not. Some users proposed alternatives to “BC” such as the Thai baht symbol and the ampersand, while others suggested a combination of both the Thai baht symbol and the Costa Rican colon symbol.

Several users suggested adding a T to the symbol – making it BTC – which remains the ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency today.

Other users, however, argued that it was unnecessary to adopt a standard symbol at all.

“The spirit of bitcoin is that there is no need for a central authority or ‘official’ policy as with other currencies,” one Bitcoin Talk user, Timo Y, wrote, adding:

“We should just let it evolve organically, like a word in a natural language.”

February 24, 2010

Satoshi continued to experiment with the logo.

He updated his original graphic over a year later, shedding the “BC” in favor of the now ubiquitous “B” with two vertical strokes.

The logo was largely well-received by Bitcoin Talk users. However, some objected that the new “B” resembled the Thai baht symbol too closely, and worried that it could create confusion. Others criticized the design for its lack of professional polish.

One such user wrote, “Is there a reason we couldn’t adopt something else before bitcoin gets too big and it’s too late to change without hurting ‘brand’ recognition? It seems silly to stick with something that is ‘ok’ when we could have something great.”

November 1, 2010

Out of thin air – that’s effectively where bitcoin’s most recognizable logo, and its creator, came from. With his first post on Bitcoin Talk, a still unidentified user going by the handle “bitboy” forever changed the visual legacy of bitcoin.

However, you wouldn’t know it from his humble message:

“Hi guys, just drop by to say hi and to share with you some of the graphics I have done. Hope you will find them useful.”

And useful they have been. Orange, flat and off-kilter, these graphics are widely utilized and riffed upon today.

Bitboy transformed Satoshi’s original concept into a more readable, scalable logo that was more brand-able than a simple gold coin. And this seems to have been intentional. Bitboy’s comments on Bitcoin Talk suggest the designs were created with something akin to marketing in mind.

Paradoxically, though, bitboy was inspired by some of the companies bitcoin hopes to unseat.

When another Bitcoin Talk user commented that the designs resembled the Mastercard logo, bitboy replied, “That’s the inspiration. The irony is as much as I hate [Mastercard] and [Visa], it is all about perception when it comes to consumer confidence and behavior. Lol”

The logo’s nod to Mastercard hasn’t been the only push to define bitcoin as a payment method, and the comparison has since created additional pressure for bitcoin and its developers as the project has had to contend with its scaling limitations.

The appeal of bitboy’s designs has also arguably been crucial to the commodification of bitcoin. A Google search suggests bitcoin merchandise has become a burgeoning industry, with more than 11 million results for the search term “bitcoin merchandise” and 34 million results for the term “bitcoin t-shirt.”

April 2014

Still, not everyone has been on board with bitcoin’s de facto logo.

Some, like those behind bitcoinsymbol.org, have been campaigning for years to change it. In fact, they don’t want bitcoin to have anything akin to a logo.

“It’s a unique image file, just like it could be used by a company to sell or promote a product,” the website, which was created by graphic design studio ECOGEX, objects. “Currencies are represented by symbols like $, € or ¥, aiming to be used everywhere by everybody.”

As such, the group advocated for the adoption of the Ƀ, which is a letter in multiple alphabets including that of Latin and several languages in Vietnam.

Speaking to their reasons, the group argues, “As a widely distributed, peer-to-peer digital currency, bitcoin needs an open-source graphic identity, designed with open source software by and for the community.”

October 31, 2016

It wouldn’t be bitcoin without a bit of controversy, however.

This particular controversy began to brew during the fall of 2016, when Phil Wilson (who uses the handle ‘Scronty’) took to Reddit, claiming that he was one of three persons collectively comprising Satoshi Nakamoto.

While Wilson lacks blockchain-based evidence for this – such as the private key to move old funds linked to Satoshi – he published extensive instructions on how to construct both Satoshi’s second gold coin logo and the bitboy’s logos.

These directions were part of a lengthy account of bitcoin’s early history that was later published by Wilson on a dedicated website. The elaborate nature of his story prompted some in the crypto industry to wonder if Wilson was, in fact, part of a team that created the bitcoin software.

Yet, Wilson also alleged that Martti Malmi, the second-ever developer of bitcoin who is also known as “Sirius,” helped with the execution of the second gold coin logo.

But Malmi has denied any involvement, leading many to suspect that Wilson’s claims amount to nothing more than extensive fan fiction about bitcoin’s origin myth.

Promotional videos show reporter Anderson Cooper speaking with high-profile Bitcoin advocate Charlie Shrem and the man who bought pizza for 10,000 bitcoin in 2010.

The program will also speak with the United States Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, digital currency expert Neha Narula and CEO of Genesis Mining Marco Streng.

It is unclear at this stage whether the story will paint Bitcoin in a positive or negative light, but there have been some early insights into what will be explored.

Bitcoin Pizza Guy

In the first ever television interview of the legendary ‘Bitcoin pizza guy,’ Laszlo Hanyecz, 60 minutes looks at his famous 2010 purchase.

On May 22 of that year, Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoin for some pizza in what is widely believed to be the first real-world transaction involving Bitcoin.

“That’s $800 million!” Anderson Cooper tells Hanyecz in the 60 Minutes promo.

“You spent about $800 million on pizza?”

Hanyecz replies, “well, (yes), if you look at today’s exchange rate.”

“Are there nights you wake up,” Cooper asks, “where you think, ‘I could have had $800 million… if I hadn’t bought those pizzas?'”

“I think thinking like that is… not really good for me,” Hanyecz replies.

Charlie Shrem

60 Minutes is also promoting an interview with Charlie Shrem, who it describes as “one of Bitcoin’s first millionaires and also one of its first convicted felons.”

In the story, Shrem, who was was jailed in 2014 over indirect links to the Silk Road marketplace, tells Anderson Cooper of the incredible highs and lows he experienced in the early days of Bitcoin.

“I felt like I was riding a rocket ship that had no mission control,” Mr Shrem said.

“You were going up very quickly but we were not thinking about what would happen when eventually we have to go back down.

“And for me I dealt with ultimate climb back down, (I) crashed really hard.”

From Iceland to Washington

For the report, Cooper visited a cryptocurrency mine in Iceland and the Federal Reserve in Washington D.C.

It is in Washington where Federal Reserve Governor Brainard warns investors that “cryptocurrency is much riskier than the U.S. dollar.”

“The Federal Reserve and ultimately the U.S. Treasury stand behind (the dollar),” says Brainard.

“And when you hold your dollars in a bank account, you have deposit insurance. None of those accountability mechanisms exist for Bitcoin.”

A confused reporter

Sneak peeks into the 60 Minutes story show Anderson Cooper asking very basic questions as he tries to grapple with the new technology.

“There’s no actual coin?” he asks the digital currency expert Neha Narula.

“I’m so antiquated I can’t imagine things that do not have a physical component.”

A producer on the show, Andy Court, has done an interview talking about how Cooper had a difficult time understanding Bitcoin.

“One of the joys was watching Andersen try to wrap his mind around this thing!” Mr Court said.

“Almost everyone knows the word and it’s amazing it’s kind of become part of our lexicon now, but still most of us don’t really know what it is.”

What kind of stocks stir up controversy like no other? Penny stocks. These tickers trading for less than $5 per share have earned a reputation as some of the most divisive names on Wall Street, with these plays either met with open arms or given the cold shoulder.It’s understandable why some investors are wary. Those opposed are quick to point out that there could be a very real reason these stocks are changing hands for pocket change, with the low share prices often masking obstacles like weak fundamentals or troubling headwinds. That said, others are drawn in by the sheer growth potential of penny stocks. The fact is that even minor share price appreciation can mean huge percentage gains, and thus, serious returns. What’s more, your money goes further with these bargain names.No matter which side you take, one thing is certain, due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions. That’s where the experts come in, namely the analysts at Roth Capital. These pros bring experience and in-depth knowledge to the table.With this in mind, our focus turned to two penny stocks that have received a thumbs up from Roth Capital analysts. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, both have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Not to mention substantial upside potential is on the table.Cellectar Biosciences (CLRB)Leveraging its patented phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) delivery platform, Cellectar Biosciences develops cutting-edge treatments for cancer. Based on the potential of its drug candidate, CLR 131, and its $1.24 share price, Roth Capital thinks that now is the time to get in on the action.Representing the firm, analyst Jonathan Aschoff tells clients that he is optimistic about CLR 131, which is a small-molecule, targeted PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells, in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) indications. According to Aschoff, following its Type B guidance meeting with the FDA, “CLRB is prepared to initiate its first pivotal CLR 131 trial in LPL/WM after achieving a 100% ORR and 75% major response rate in four patients.” He points out that although CLRB just reported promising results in multiple myeloma (MM) (40% ORR in triple class refractory (TCR) patients at total body doses of at least 60mCi), LPL/WM was selected for the initial pivotal trial based on the very strong initial results and the lower competition for patients.“We view this as a prudent decision because NCCN compedia listing in MM is a mere peer-reviewed publication away, if first approved in LPL/WM. We also note that CLRB has steadily improved its dosing of CLR 131, essentially fractionating the doses so that higher total body doses are well tolerated,” Aschoff further explained. Adding to the good news, the therapy generated activity in preliminary Phase 1 unresectable brain tumors. Aschoff added, “Disease control was shown in two heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas, showing the drug's ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and all doses through 60 mCi/m2 have exhibited a favorable safety profile.”To this end, Aschoff rates CLRB a Buy along with a $10 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 713%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Aschoff’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: CLRB is a Strong Buy. Given the $5.48 average price target, shares could soar 345% from current levels. (See CLRB stock analysis on TipRanks)Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)With vast gene therapy experience, Applied Genetic Technologies designs and constructs all critical gene therapy elements and brings them together to develop successful treatments for patients. Currently going for $4.50 apiece, Roth Capital believes this stock’s long-term growth narrative is strong.Firm analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out that recently released data for its XLRP gene therapy program, which is expected to enter pivotal studies in Q1 2021, reaffirmed his bullish thesis. “Despite the market not fully appreciating the data given how the stock traded, we continue to believe that the results suggest that AGTC could have a best-in-class therapy, which is supportive of the planned pivotal efforts,” he explained.Providing an update on the results of the Phase 1/2 XLRP study, using the FDA's criteria, AGTC evaluated responses at 12 months in the lower dose groups (2 and 4), and 6 months in the higher dose groups (5 and 6). According to Jallah, “initial responses were observed in dose Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with impressive response durability even at 12 months.”On top of this, at 6 months, the dose used in Group 5 resulted in a 43% response rate or a 57% response rate if excluding a patient not meeting the enrollment criteria. In Group 6, a response rate of 50% was observed, or 100% excluding patients not meeting the enrollment criteria.Jallah added, “All measurements were obtained in the 36 perimetry grid, which we believe should make it easier to preselect loci likely to respond. Although BCVA is not the primary endpoint, BCVA improvements, which can capture changes in the central region, were maintained at 12 months.”Even though some investors have expressed concern about Meira’s competing therapy, Jallah believes AGTC’s technology could have a leg up. “Overall, we believe that the data from both companies is strongly indicative of the efficacy potential of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease, and although differences in the study design makes direct comparisons difficult, we believe that AGTC could have a competitive advantage heading into pivotal studies,” he commented.In line with his optimistic approach, Jallah reiterated a Buy rating and $30 price target, indicating 568% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here)All in all, other analysts echo Jallah’s sentiment. 5 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $18.25 is less aggressive than Jallah’s but still leaves room for upside potential of 306%.

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment.",,https://www.eweek.com/innovation/blockchain-cryptocurrency-s-future-debated-at-consensus-conference,"NEW YORK—If you are still confused about what blockchain is and what it can be used for, don’t worry. The crypto industry is still trying to figure that out, too.

Here at Coindesk’s Consensus 2019 conference, fledgling software companies pitched new pieces for future incarnations of blockchain, while new advocacy groups discussed why it is important to normalize the technology for customers and regulators, and economists said they were skeptical of the whole thing.

To be sure, there is a lot of development going on in blockchain, cryptocurrency, coins and security tokens and distributed ledgers, as vendors look to improve on basic plumbing of blockchain frameworks like Ethereum and Hyperledger or make their own.

For instance, Polymath is building a security token blockchain in collaboration with Ethereum pioneer Charles Hoskinson. Dubbed Polymesh, the new platform will be designed specifically for companies that want to create regulation-compliant security tokens. The idea, Hoskinson said, is that now small businesses “can use templates and not have to hire armies of lawyers and bankers to do business.”

Another company, Bloq, added to its Enterprise and Labs platforms with the new Bloq Cloud, dubbed as blockchain infrastructure as a service, which among other things will enable different blockchains to work together. Likewise, Ark announced Ark Deployer, dubbed a point-and-click blockchain, which is due out in Alpha later this month. Yet another vendor, Blockstack, is creating its own ecosystem that promises to give users control over fundamental digital rights of identity, data-ownership, privacy, and security, said co-founder Muneeb Ali in a session here.

Acceptance is growing for using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange, and payment network Flexa launched its “Spedn” wallet app that will let people buy goods with cryptocurrencies online or in physical stores. The technology currently supports bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and the gemini dollar, and it’ll work at retailers including GameStop, Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Caribou Coffee, Jamba Juice, and Crate and Barrel.

Rallying for blockchain

All these projects are still young and relatively untested, which is putting pressure on the communities of stakeholders and developers around the projects to advocate to grow them in every way, from number of developers working on code to businesses using them, and to putting it into clear language for regulators to understand.

A major initiative is called the Web 3 Foundation, whose mission is to see a fully decentralized web come to fruition, one that is protected by mind-bogglingly complex cryptographic protocols such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs. One company betting on ZKP is privacy vendor QEDIT, which late last month announced it is working with ​VMware​, ​Ant Financial​, and ​RGAX to develop privacy applications.

Another brand-new organization is the Open Money Initiative, which is seeking to leverage blockchain and cryptocurrency to help citizens in closed or repressed economies, such as Venezuela. But as Jill Carlson, co-founder of OMI, acknowledges, such technology is not enough to help such difficult situations. “We want it to be a technology problem,” she said. “But it's really a human problem.”

Also, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the standards body working for businesses using Ethereum’s code, released a third version of its client specification, as well as updates on privacy and performance.

In search of use cases

Despite active development and passionate proponents, the real obstacle to widespread adoption of blockchain is enterprise use cases. IBM have been talking up blockchain for years, but there have not been many new ideas beyond supply chain management. IBM has a major project ongoing with shipping giant Maersk.

At Consensus, Kimberly Harrington, Blockchain Center of Excellence Leader at Bayer, discussed some live deployments the company has around tracking and tracing of seeds.

“Traditionally, when you think about transparency, the concept is ‘farm to fork,’ but we start before the farm,” she said. “The seeds are produced and leave our organization and then go into fields with growers, where there’s an entire process that transforms that product into something that’s sold. [Blockchain] really helps to get all of the parties to coordinate and participate more efficiently.”

Other compelling use cases show up in healthcare, where organizations are testing blockchain for managing clinical trial data, and another for physician credential management. That one is done by Hashed Health, which is looking to help organizations cut administrative costs, said Corey Todaro, the company’s CTO.

Economists on a panel made the distinction between cryptocurrencies like bitcoin vs. blockchain platforms that enable users to get things done. “Count me as a crypto skeptic,” said Harvard University economist Eric Maskin. “It’s a dubious store of value and I worry that we’re replacing government fiat currency with private money.”

The question of “Why Blockchain At All?” also was considered. Joshua Gans, Professor of Strategic Management at the University of Toronto, said, “You have to boil it down to, what is this reducing the cost of?” he said. “There are two places. One is the cost of verification [of a transaction] and the cost of building out a network. The rest is supply and demand.”

Crypto visions pointing the way forward

At the end of the day it was not clear if anyone was closer to agreeing what it all means beyond the price of bitcoin. One thing is for sure: The people who are working around blockchain are true believers that their technology will someday become pervasive, whatever the eventual use case. The blockchain is inevitable, they say.

Perhaps that is why Ken Liu was such an inspired keynote speaker this week. Liu is a Hugo Award winning science fiction writer, a lawyer, and also a coder. He has unique a perspective on blockchain’s role in a hypothetical future where “code is law.”

“I got interested in the potential of blockchain and bitcoin to transform a lot of the problems that we have in contemporary life. I wanted to explain them in ways that are beyond the usual stories, that cryptocurrencies are only used to buy drugs, which seems to be the narrative in popular culture,” Liu said.

There are other stories about blockchain, like distributed, transparent, securely executed smart contracts, and utopian visions that blockchain will eliminate government corruption and enable democracy to flourish, he said.

“A storyteller can make up all kinds of stories and doesn’t need to back it up with any kind of real implementation,” he said. “I really have to caution the rest of you against believing your stories as though they are the truth.”

The only way forward is to invest in and work toward the vision, and then see what happens. “You have to put in the work to enjoy the result,” he said.

What they got was a 22-year-old Orthodox Jewish stoner living in his parents’ Brooklyn basement.

Charlie Shrem was the founder of BitInstant, one of the first firms to buy Bitcoin for clients. In his Midtown office, with weed paraphernalia on every shelf, he kept three bongs on his desk — and was toking from one as he met the millionaires.

“Welcome to the ‘Bakery,’ gentlemen,” said Shrem, according to the new book by Ben Mezrich, “Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption” (Flatiron Books), out Tuesday.

“If these walls could talk — well, they’d sound pretty f–ked up. There’s been a lot of secondhand smoke in this room.”

Shrem’s pitch: The Winklevosses could become two of the burgeoning phenomenon’s premier investors. The brothers bit, investing $800,000 in BitInstant in exchange for 22 percent of the company.

They quickly became the world’s top buyers of Bitcoin — so much so that they drove up the price and eventually became the currency’s first billionaires in 2017.

Shrem, however, would end up burned by his own hubris.

The day the three met, BitInstant was selling three out of every 10 Bitcoin and the currency was trading at $7.43 a coin. By early 2013, Bitcoin was going for $100 a pop.

BitInstant was a pioneer in a lucrative field. CEO Shrem was profiled in Bloomberg Businessweek, and became part owner of a Midtown club, EVR, where he held court nightly, downing shots and “making it rain” by throwing cash in the air.

“For the first time in Charlie’s life, people listened to him, and he had discovered that was a high on a par with [marijuana],” Mezrich writes.

The new millionaire was finally able to escape his parents’ basement — he moved upstairs from the club — and began dating an EVR waitress, Courtney Warner, who was a head taller than Shrem and, Mezrich writes, “way out of his league.”

On their first date, Shrem slammed shots of Bacardi and threw up all over Warner.

“When he’d gone to the bathroom to clean himself up,” Mezrich writes, “he’d assumed she’d be racing for the door, but [she didn’t]. At that moment, Charlie had known she was the one.”

The partying was affecting his professional life. At a meeting with a venture capitalist, Shrem showed up “barely vertical,” reeking of alcohol, with three shirt buttons opened.

“Charlie launched into his presentation like the Tasmanian Devil,” Mezrich writes. “He’d been almost unintelligible, nonsensical.”

After the meeting, the angry twins told him that maybe he was not the best person to be CEO.

His response: “Sometimes you guys can be such suits.”

Shrem was not only CEO, but also chief compliance officer, which would prove to be his downfall.

Though a finance and economics graduate of Brooklyn College, he had never educated himself on laws governing US money transmission.

BitInstant had a $1,000 daily limit on Bitcoin purchases, but a user known as BTCKing regularly tried to bypass this, attempting to buy $4,000. Shrem relented — something a good compliance officer would not have done — and BTCKing became one of BitInstant’s biggest customers, eventually spending some $900,000.

In January 2014, Shrem, returning from meetings overseas, was accosted at JFK Airport by 15 agents from the IRS, FBI, DEA, NYPD and more. He was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, failure to file a suspicious-activity report, and operating an unlicensed money transmitter.

The Bitcoin BTCKing bought had been used for illegal drug purchases. Shrem was facing 25 years in prison.

Shrem was released on bail on the condition he had a stable place to live. So it was back to the basement.

In 2015, he struck a plea deal and was sentenced to two years in prison. Released after a year, he and Warner married and moved to a boat off the coast of Florida.

Last November, the Winklevosses sued Shrem, claiming he shorted them out of 5,000 Bitcoin they had paid him to purchase for them. Shrem denied this, and in February the brothers were ordered to pay him more than $45,000 in legal fees. Last month, both parties settled the suit under confidential terms.

Shrem, now 29, hasn’t strayed too far from his passion with his latest business venture, the cryptocurrency-information Web site Crypto.IQ.

As he told the court before his sentencing: “Bitcoin is what I love and all I have. It’s my whole life. It’s what I’m on this Earth to do … it ­allowed everyone to be equal.”",2019-05-18,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/crypto-market-testing-crucial-support-bitcoin-cash-litecoin-eos-xlm-analysis/,"The total crypto market cap declined sharply and tested an important support near $210.0B.

Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis

Bitcoin cash price surged towards the $450 level and recently declined heavily against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair broke the $400 and $385 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The recent decline was such that the price even broke the $365 support and tested the $350 support level.

The price is currently consolidating above the $350 support and it could correct higher in the short term. An immediate resistance is at $375, above which the price may test the $385 level.

Litecoin (LTC), EOS and Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis

Litecoin price failed to stay above the $100 level and topped near the $107 level. LTC price is down sharply and it recently traded below the $100, $95 and $92 support levels. The price even broke $90 and tested the $85 support level.

EOS price recently traded below the key $6.40 and $6.20 support levels. More importantly, it broke the $6.00 support level and the price test the $5.85 support. It could recover in the short term and might test $6.00 or $6.20.

Stellar price is performing well and remained well bid above the $0.1150 support level. XLM price is up more than 7% and it recently broke the $0.1250 and $0.1300 resistance levels. The next key hurdles are $0.1350 and $0.1380, where sellers may emerge.

The market cap declined more than $40.0B and tested the $210.0B support area. It seems like there is a strong support forming near the $210.0B level and a connecting bullish trend line on the same chart.

Traveling is on everyone’s minds as summer approaches and crypto enthusiasts are no exception. But for anyone thinking of a holiday trip, travel arrangements can be arduous. Crypto payments can make your life easier in that regard, particularly with bitcoin cash, which is a fast and cheap way to pay for anything. The following guide shows you how to travel the world on BCH.

Book Flights, Hotels, Cars and Train Tickets With BCH

A lot of things have changed since the early days of Bitcoin and there are now much more places and ways to spend your electronic cash. Cryptocurrencies are yet to gain mainstream adoption in many sectors, but the travel industry has already proven to be quite hospitable towards crypto holders.

A number of travel sites now take major coins including BCH for booking flights, hotels and car rentals. Cheapair is the first major online travel agency to process crypto payments after it started accepting bitcoin back in 2013, initially for flights and soon after that for accommodation as well.

The U.S.-based platform acts as an intermediary between the providers of these services which are paid in fiat and clients who would like to pay with cryptocurrency. In response to customer demand, Cheapair.com added bitcoin cash (BCH) to its payment options about a year ago, noting its improved transaction potential in comparison with bitcoin core (BTC).

Bitcoin.Travel is another well-known platform which accepts payments in seven cryptocurrencies, including BCH. On its website, you can search for flights, hotels and car rentals offered by its partners. Crypto payments are made on confirmation but the funds are transferred to the service provider at least a day after you check in.

Payouts are made in cryptocurrency which means the participating businesses accept coins. According to the Polish agency, you can currently book rentals, tours or other activities using your favorite cryptocurrency. Note, however, that trying to book a flight usually redirects you to a partner that may not support crypto payments.

600,000 Property Listings Available to BCH Holders

To make sure that bitcoin cash supporters will have the opportunity to arrange their trip using BCH, Bitcoin.com recently teamed up with Travala, a leading blockchain booking platform. Travala.com will be integrated into the Bitcoin.com Wallet whose 4 million users will be able to take advantage of its services thanks to the partnership agreement.

The agency offers savings up to 40% on hotel bookings and accepts cryptocurrencies including bitcoin cash. With over 82,000 destinations in 210 countries, Travala is a global platform and bitcoin cash holders will now be able to choose from almost 600,000 property listings for their next holiday, directly from their Bitcoin.com Wallet.

Destinia is another option if you are looking to spend your bitcoin cash on traveling. The platform is available in over 30 languages and maintains a search engine similar to any other travel agency, only the services it facilitates can be paid with cryptocurrency. Note, however, that prices are displayed in mBCH.

Beside hotels, flights and cars, you can also pay for train tickets, which is a welcome addition. Railway companies in most countries are yet to integrate crypto payments but Destinia has already made this transport option available to cryptocurrency users. It currently sells tickets for the railway systems of a dozen nations including major tourist destinations such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, Canada and the U.S.

Business Travelers Are Covered as Well

Startups, professionals and entrepreneurs in the crypto space can also check out Corporate Traveller, a U.K.-based business travel management platform. Like Destinia, this agency provides rail transportation options along with flights, car hire and accommodation. Not long ago, Corporate Traveller began accepting bitcoin cash payments from companies making travel arrangements for their employees. If you contact them, their consultants will be able to offer you help and fares you can pay with BCH thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.

Airtreks is another booking platform that works with the same crypto payments provider. It lets you explore global routes with multi-stop international flights and helps you prepare your long itinerary with its Tripplanner feature. Its website currently advertises around the world specials such as “The Grand Escape,” “Circle the Globe,” and “Beach Hopping.” And if you like visiting exotic places, Bookmauritiushotels.com is a website that offers “the best prices you can ever find” for hotels in the island nation which you can pay for with BCH.

Other companies in the industry accepting cryptocurrency payments through Bitpay include the Latvian national carrier Airbaltic and the German travel sites Fluege and Nurflug. According to a thread on the Bitcointalk forum, there’s also a bunch of gift card platforms, such as Gyft, Egifter and Giftoffs, which work with the popular payment processor. The integration allows you to purchase gift cards for products and services offered by airline companies like American Airlines, Delta, Southwest, and Virgin. You can also pay for flights, hotels or travel packages using the gift cards of Lastminute, Jet2Holidays and Flightgiftcard which can be purchased with BCH.

The Bitcoin Cash Map is Expanding

Once you reach your destination, you may want to find places where you can easily spend more of your bitcoin cash. One useful application that will help you to locate brick and mortar stores which allow you to pay with BCH is Marco Coino. It’s been developed by Bitcoin.com for both iOS and Android devices and it has an online version as well.

The merchant directory now lists over 1,000 physical locations accepting bitcoin cash. The stores are spread all over the world with the interactive map showing the highest concentration in Europe. If you run a business taking BCH or you happen to find one that’s not listed yet, you can easily add a new store to the Marco Coino map.

An alternative platform showing locations where you can pay directly with BCH is Bitcoinmap.cash. It has both a web-based version and a mobile app available in the Google Play store. All the venues displayed on its map accept either bitcoin cash or dash, while some of the shops also take bitcoin core. You’ll enjoy discounts of up to 20% on your first BCH payment in many of the participating stores.

But even if you are in a place where only fiat currency is accepted, there are still ways to spend your bitcoin cash. Here are two debit card issuers that support it: Bitpay’s Visa card in the U.S. can be loaded with BCH and used to purchase goods and services through a conversion to U.S. dollars. And Fuzex is another crypto card project with global reach that last year chose bitcoin cash (BCH) as its base cryptocurrency. Its card is issued to residents of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

Traveling is rarely cheap, whether you are on a vacation or a business trip. In case you run out of bitcoin cash, there’s already a wide network of ATMs around the world where you can top up your BCH wallet. A quick look at Coinatmradar’s BCH Map shows there are now more than 1,800 machines and tellers on the planet that can sell you BCH coins. Many of these will also buy your electronic cash in case you need some paper money.

Whats App users can now send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) via the popular messaging platform thanks to the Lite.Im bot. The announcement is the latest attempt to simplify the cryptocurrency transaction process, bringing virtual currencies closer to the everyday person.

Sending Bitcoin on WhatsApp

In a tweet published by Zulu Republic on Sunday (May 19, 2019), the digital platform announced that its cryptocurrency messaging platform Lite.Im had introduced a simple way to send and receive bitcoin via WhatsApp.

All users have to do is add the Lite.Im WhatsApp bot and follow the on-screen prompts. There are numerous options for users apart from sending and receiving BTC and LTC.

The service also allows people to earn cryptocurrency via a referral program. There are also options that allow users to set their default coin, as well as select their preferred language and password.

Presently, the two default languages are English and Spanish. The service also supports sending and receiving Ether (ETH) and ZTX – the native token on the Zulu Republic platform.

Making BTC Transactions Easier

SMS-based cryptocurrency transactions introduce some simplicity into the cryptocurrency transaction paradigm, especially for less tech-savvy individuals. Lite.Im already has similar services for Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and SMS.

According to the company, “social messaging” is an important component of wider cryptocurrency adoption. WhatsApp alone has more than 1.5 billion users in virtually every corner of the globe.

With mobile money transactions becoming easier in places across Southeast Asia and Africa, there is the possibility of more unbanked and underbanked people getting greater access to payment channels.

In 2019 alone, there has been a slew of announcements from different establishments about plans to adopt Bitcoin. From trading desks to acceptance as a medium of exchange, the top-ranked cryptocurrency continues to dominate the news.

Many commentators in the industry say BTC is becoming a more mature asset class and looks well on its way to fulfilling the expectations of many early believers.

Competition for ‘Facebook Coin’

With Facebook having its own cryptocurrency plans, Lite.Im could potentially be seen as competition. There is no official word about the exact nature of the social messaging giant’s virtual currency ambition but rumors persist that it will be a “Bitcoin-like” cryptocurrency token.

Though it’s like FBCoin will be anything but. Luckily, you can already send bitcoin on Whats App.

The Crypto-Friendly VPN Provider Has 3,700 Servers in 60 Countries

Beside the need to safeguard personal data, which is often exposed in industrialized societies, there’s also the issue with restricted access to information, typical for nations under authoritarian regimes with heavy state-sponsored censorship programs. Other barriers include various geolocation restrictions limiting the availability of certain services in some markets.

VPN (virtual private network) providers help you overcome the challenges on these fronts and their services enjoy a growing popularity in the expanding crypto space. At this stage, not all of them accept digital currency payments, which add another layer of security, but there are some notable exceptions. These include Express VPN and Private Internet Access.

Cyberghost is another crypto-friendly platform, which has been credited for its simple to use software. It is a good choice for beginners. Cyberghost shields your private data and protects your online identity from hacking attacks and other encroachment attempts.

The service helps you stay safe on public wi-fi networks and hides your real IP address when surfing from your home. It uses encryption and maintains a no logs policy. The VPN also facilitates more secure financial transactions including online banking.

Another strong side of Cyberghost is that it has almost 3,700 servers in over 60 countries and offers unlimited bandwidth and traffic. Its major advantage for cryptocurrency users is the option to pay with digital coins for its services. An integration with Bitpay allows you to spend your bitcoin cash for one of its subscription plans which currently start at $2.75 a month.

If you are looking for other products and services to buy with your BCH, check out Bitcoin.com’s Spend Bitcoin Cash page. The online store allows you to shop for apparel and bitcoin branded accessories, purchase gift cards for major brands and retailers or buy a hardware wallet with discount.

There were no coins or bills, just long strings of letters and numbers stored inside a network of computers that anybody could be a part of by downloading some free software over the Internet. Today that computerized currency, bitcoin, is well-known, though little understood, and bitcoin's popularity has inspired the creation of thousands of other types of digital money, known as ""cryptocurrency."" Over the last decade, you could have made a five million percent profit by investing in cryptocurrency. Or you could have lost everything. It has been a wild ride, and few people have experienced the highs and lows more than a 29-year-old named Charlie Shrem.

Charlie Shrem: I felt like I was riding a rocket ship that had no mission control. You were going up very quickly. But we were not thinking about what would happen when eventually we have to go back down? And, for me, I dealt with the ultimate going back down.

Anderson Cooper: You crashed hard?

Charlie Shrem: Crashed really hard.

Charlie Shrem

Charlie Shrem was once described as the last kid who'd be picked for a game of dodgeball, but he always felt comfortable around computers. He grew up in a Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn, New York and was a senior at Brooklyn College when, in 2011, he started a business in his parent's basement. He called it ""BitInstant,"" because it enabled people to buy bitcoin quickly, using dollars, at a time when interest in the computerized currency was just starting.

Anderson Cooper: When did you first notice the business taking off?

Charlie Shrem: Almost instantly. The business--

Anderson Cooper: That-- really, (LAUGH) that fast?

Charlie Shrem: I had $1,000 that I threw into it, that was my own money. And then within days it was getting crazy. And I had my bar mitzvah money that I wanted to use. (LAUGHTER)

Within a year, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of Facebook fame became major investors in Charlie's company. By 2013, he was pronounced one of bitcoin's first millionaires. Estimates of his net worth ranged from a few million dollars to 45 million.

Charlie Shrem: I went from being a kid who had no self-confidence to the complete opposite, with a crazy ego. And I was doing, you know, media interviews every day and I was the evangelizer of the industry-- the bitcoin Moses as they would call me.

Anderson Cooper: You go from being the last kid picked at dodgeball-- to, you know...

Charlie Shrem: Running the team.

How did Charlie and other 20-somethings become kings of a new industry that deals in money you can't deposit in the bank? To understand that, you have to go back to a time when confidence in banks had plummeted.

Shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, during the financial crisis of 2008, this paper started circulating on the internet. It proposed creating an ""electronic cash system"" that would allow people to pay one another online ""without going through a financial institution."" To this day, no one has the faintest idea who the paper's author, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is. But he, or she, or they, created ingenious software that anyone in the world could download onto their computer for free.

The computers running the bitcoin software were then able to work together over the internet and perform functions normally handled by banks, like keeping accurate records and guarding against fraud.

The computers maintain a constantly updated record of transactions involving bitcoin. The record is called the ""blockchain,"" and it's how the network keeps track of who owns what.



One of the most innovative features of the system is that every computer on the network can keep a copy of this record showing every transaction ever recorded.

Neha Narula

Neha Narula: The blockchain's stored on thousands of computers around the world.

Neha Narula is the director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.

Neha Narula: The idea behind the blockchain is that it's everywhere. And everyone can look at it and verify it for themselves. And so what this means is that you get this sense of trust. You get this sense of security because everyone's watching.

If you're wondering what there is to watch, here it is. Bitcoin's not much to look at, just letters and numbers.

Anderson Cooper: Why would people have trust in something that is just numbers and letters? It doesn't have anything backing it up.

Neha Narula: I think to answer that question, you really have to go back to sorta the roots of money and what is money. The reason that the $5 bill in my wallet has value is because I know you'll take it from me for something. I can buy a sandwich from you with that $5 bill.

Anderson Cooper: So it has value because people believe in it?

Neha Narula: Exactly. And that's it. That's really it.

At first, bitcoin was just an interesting experiment conducted at home by computer programmers like Laszlo Hanyecz. Because his computer was one of those computers helping to maintain the bitcoin network, Satoshi Nakamoto's software rewarded Hanyecz with some bitcoin. But there wasn't much he could do with it back in 2010. So he went on an internet chat forum and asked whether anyone would be willing to buy him some pizza in exchange for 10,000 bitcoin.

Laszlo Hanyecz: And somebody there said, ""Hey, I'll-- you know, I'll take you up on that offer."" Here you can see the original pizzas. And that's my daughter's hand. She was a year old.

That pizza obtained with bitcoin by Laszlo Hanyecz and enjoyed by his daughter nine years ago is believed to be the first real-world transaction involving cryptocurrency.

Anderson Cooper: Do you feel like, after that that that changed people's perception of it, in a way?

Laszlo Hanyecz: I think it-- it made it real for some people. I mean it certainly did for me.

Laszlo Hanyecz

In the years that followed, bitcoin caught on. Some merchants started accepting it, and it became possible to buy and sell bitcoin for dollars through businesses called exchanges. As the market price of one bitcoin rose from zero to a dollar to $100 and more, an esoteric experiment grew into a global industry.

On a wind-swept plain in Iceland, these warehouses are closely guarded at all times. We were asked not to disclose their exact location.

This is one of the places where the records, the ""blockchains,"" of crytocurrencies are now kept. State-of-the-art computers work 24/7, performing calculations that safeguard the records. In industry lingo, this is called a ""mine.""

Anderson Cooper: This does not look like any mine I've ever been in.

Marco Streng: Yes. Now this is a-- mine of a new world. This is the new gold mine

Marco Streng is the CEO of a company called Genesis Mining.

Marco Streng: So there's tens of thousands of processing units in here. And if you add all the computing power of all the processing units together, you have more than the world's number one supercomputer.

Correspondent Anderson Cooper and Marco Streng walk through one of the warehouses keeping blockchain records

Back in New York, by 2013 Charlie Shrem had finally moved his company's computers out of his parents' basement. He was spending a lot of time travelling to industry conferences and talking up bitcoin.

Charlie was charismatic.

Charlie was funny.

But could charlie be trusted to run a business?

In a new book, ""Bitcoin Billionaires,"" Ben Mezrich describes how BitInstant's biggest investors, the Winklevoss twins, grew concerned that their young CEO was spending too much time travelling and partying and not paying enough attention to the details of running his company. For example: Charlie knew the U.S. government was concerned about how cyber-thieves and money-launderers were using bitcoin. His company was required to monitor its customers and report any suspicious activity. Banks have whole departments that are supposed to do this. The person at BitInstant who Charlie put in charge of it, was Charlie.

Anderson Cooper: So you were in charge-- of making sure that you complied with-- with rules and regulations for financial transaction--

Charlie Shrem: Yes.

Anderson Cooper: Was that a good idea?

Charlie Shrem: No. (LAUGHTER) Very bad idea.

In 2013, Charlie had other problems too. A documentary called ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"" showed what happened when the price of bitcoin rapidly rose and fell. Charlie's company and an exchange it did business with couldn't keep up with customer's orders.

Charlie Shrem in ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"": People can't buy and sell, and they can't withdraw, and they can't deposit, the whole thing is just a fritz.

BitInstant went out of business in July 2013, a victim of bitcoin's volatile landscape and Charlie's many mistakes.

Charlie Shrem: I look back at myself and I say, ""I don't even know if I would do business with myself.""

Anderson Cooper: Essentially you're saying you couldn't be trusted then?

Charlie Shrem: 100%.

Six months later, in January 2014, he was returning from a trip abroad when he got stopped at passport control in Kennedy Airport.

Charlie Shrem: I got surrounded and-- by-- a whole pupu platter of federal agents. And--

Anderson Cooper: A pupu (CHUCKLE) platter—of federal agents

Charlie Shrem: Yeah, like all mixtry of D.E.A., I.R.S.-- N.Y.P.D., J.F.K. security-- you had all of 'em

Federal agents had evidence that Charlie knew one of his customers was buying bitcoin and then re-selling it on a website where it was used to buy illegal drugs.

Charlie Shrem: When I got arrested, the first thing I told my lawyer is, ""I'm guilty. Let's make a deal."" Because I knew immediately that I had done what they said I did.

One of bitcoin's first millionaires was now one of its first felons. But that didn't stop the market price of bitcoin from rising from about $250 when Charlie went to prison in 2015 to nearly 20,000 dollars at the end of 2017. It then plunged 84% before climbing back to more than $8,000 this past week.

Remember: a bitcoin was worth less than a penny when Laszlo Hanyecz first traded bitcoin for pizza nine years ago. We calculated that if Hanyecz had held onto all the bitcoin he used back then to get various items, much of it pizza, by the time of our interview those bitcoins would have been worth...

Anderson Cooper: $800 million.

Laszlo Hanyecz: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: So-- okay. (CHUCKLE) Sorry, let me just get this straight. You spent about $800 million on pizza?

Laszlo Hanyecz: Well, if you look at today's exchange rate.

Anderson Cooper: Are there nights you wake up, like, in a cold sweat, where-- you-- (CHUCKLE) think-- ""I could have had 800 million dollars if I hadn't bought those pizzas?""

Laszlo Hanyecz: I think thinking like that is-- is not really good for me.

There's a long list of financial leaders who think bitcoin's not good for anyone. Lael Brainard, one of the governors of the Federal Reserve, agreed to speak with us because she wanted to make sure ordinary investors understand the risks of cryptocurrency.

Lael Brainard

Anderson Cooper: There are people who say that cryptocurrency-- it's better than real currency because it's not controlled by any government and it means it's not subject to manipulation by central bankers like you, no offense.

Lael Brainard: The U.S.-- currency has a whole set of legal protections around it. The federal reserve and ultimately the U.S. treasury stand behind it. And when you hold your dollars in a bank account, you have deposit insurance.

Anderson Cooper: And that doesn't exist with cryptocurrencies?

Lael Brainard: None of those accountability mechanisms exist-- for bitcoin.

Charlie Shrem spent a year in prison. When he got out, the man once described as ""Bitcoin Moses"" worked in a restaurant, parting seas of dirty dishes for $8 an hour. But like bitcoin, Charlie Shrem bounced back.

Three years after getting out of prison, he's living very comfortably in Florida. He told us he's made money blogging, consulting, and investing in cryptocurrency and is now captain of his own destiny. He's even got a boat he named ""Satoshi,"" after bitcoin's mysterious creator.

After watching this, you may be wondering why the world needs cryptocurrencies. Neha Narula of MIT's digital currency initiative argues they can make a difference.

Neha Narula: The thing that excites me about cryptocurrencies is that we can experiment with the transfer of value. We can put new features into money. We can change the way money works.

She says cryptocurrency has already helped people in countries like Venezuela where the monetary system is in crisis. And in the future it may be able to do things like speed up and lower the cost of worldwide money transfers.

Neha Narula: People used to say, ""Why do we need email? I can just call someone on the phone. And now, we can't live without it.

Anderson Cooper: So this is one of those conversations that 20 years from now, someone could replay, and have a good laugh because I'm asking such moronic questions that will be so obvious to everybody?

Neha Narula: Or they'll be laughing at me because I said cryptocurrencies were gonna be a thing and they totally flamed out and died.

Anderson Cooper: It still could go either way.

Neha Narula: It could really go either way. It's-- that's what makes it so exciting and interesting.

Produced by Andy Court and Evie Salomon",2019-05-19,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-and-blockchain-the-tangled-history-of-two-tech-buzzwords,"“I’m interested in blockchain, not bitcoin.”

Admit it, you’ve heard this hundreds, if not thousands, of times. (You might have even said it yourself.) And sure, people know what you’re saying, you’re talking about the “technology underlying bitcoin” and you sound smart enough.

Once it became known – or at least presumed – that you could apply cryptography in finance, in ways similar to how it’s used in bitcoin, everyone started making sure that statement fell from their lips. And that refrain – kicked off by bitcoin itself – remains powerful today.

Sounds plausible? Sure. But, interestingly, the word “blockchain” doesn’t actually appear in the original bitcoin white paper, released back in 2008. Rather, the white paper uses the words “block” and “chain” separately many times.

It describes the word “block” as the vehicle for a bundle bitcoin transactions. Then, these blocks of are linked together, forming a “chain” of “blocks.”

So, who created this ultimate industry buzzword?

That damn blockchain

Turns out, the origins of the word are not quite so revolutionary.

“The word blockchain was never used in the early days,” former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn told CoinDesk. Although, Hearn did acknowledge that Satoshi often referred to bitcoin’s “proof-of-work chain” in discussions on forums.

It seems the first references to the word came about on Bitcoin Talk, a bitcoin-specific forum created by Satoshi, in July 2010 – more than a year after bitcoin’s release.

And at that time, these remarks weren’t about how innovative the technology was, but instead were complaints about how long it took to download the bitcoin “blockchain” (the entire history of bitcoin transactions).

While compared to today, the download would have far faster, according to one Bitcoin Talk user: “The initial blockchain download is quite slow.”

In other words, initially, blockchain was far from the sexy word it is today.

Blockchain mania

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the word really took hold.

But interest in the term seems to have sprung out of professional organizations and individuals hesitance to align themselves with bitcoin itself because of its bad reputation as the currency for drugs and gray economies.

“I think it [became popular] around the time people started going to Washington [D.C.] and trying to make bitcoin respectable by divorcing the currency from the underlying algorithms,” Hearn said.

To many, bitcoin the currency could be decoupled from bitcoin the blockchain protocol, and so a whole new industry of so-called “private blockchains,” devoid of a cryptocurrency, emerged. Sure enough, around that time in 2015, Google Trends data show the term surged.

“Initially people said ‘block chain’, and then, thanks to a great PR campaign, we were blessed with the much improved ‘blockchain,’ single-word, probably thanks to a community-wide effort near and around the Bitcoin Talk forums,” long-time cryptocurrency developer Greg Slepak said.

Not only did it become one word, but it also came in vogue to describe any blockchain that wasn’t bitcoin’s blockchain as “a blockchain.” Bitcoin got to keep the terminology “the blockchain,” giving credence to the fact that it was the first.

Yet blockchain has become so divorced from bitcoin that both words typically see a similar spike when cryptocurrency prices start mooning. For instance, the word blockchain saw a huge uptick in Google searches in late 2017.

World’s first blockchain?

Still, it’s unclear exactly where the idea itself begins. To some, blockchains existed even before bitcoin, although that term wasn’t applied to them back then.

For instance, cryptographer Stuart Haber, whose whitepapers on timestamping were cited in the bitcoin white paper, claims to have created the first blockchain called Surety.

According to Haber, that has to be the reason why Satoshi cited his work – three times out of just nine total citations. Surety was launched in 1995 for timestamping records, and it’s still running today.

Yet, Haber admits that his version doesn’t have all the same benefits of bitcoin since it’s centralized – managed by one company.

And that highlights where things get tricky when you’re talking about a blockchain. See, there isn’t necessarily agreement on a single definition of a the technology.

The Merriam Webster dictionary actually presents a much older word for blockchain – “a chain in which the alternate links are broad blocks connected by thin side links pivoted to the ends of the blocks, used with sprocket wheels to transmit power, as in a bicycle.”

While Google defines blockchain as:

But, for those seasoned veterans of the space, even this definition is problematic. Many of these new-age private blockchains don’t record their transactions publicly.

“The term has become so widespread that it’s quickly losing meaning,” as The Verge put it earlier this year.

Blind men

Haber pointed to an Indian parable to help explain the incompatible descriptions.

In the parable, a group of blind men come upon an elephant and start touching the animal to try and figure it out what it was in front of them.

Depending on what part of the elephant each man is touching, their answer changes. For instance, one of the blind men, touching the elephant’s trunk, thinks it’s a snake, while the other, touching the elephant’s leg, exclaims it’s a tree trunk.

It’s similar when people define blockchain, Haber said.

He told CoinDesk:

“Some definitions will be completely silly, showing that people don’t understand what they’re doing, but there will also be a bunch of accurate descriptions of various parts of the vast body of work.”

As such, he argues there isn’t just one meaning.

Even though, bitcoiners believe a blockchain can only be the one and only bitcoin blockchain, like words, definitions are always evolving and changing.

Blockchain shirt image via CoinDesk archives",2019-05-19 09:15:09+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/inflation-bug-still-a-danger-to-more-than-half-of-all-bitcoin-full-nodes,"Figures published by bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr show that more than half of the full nodes in the bitcoin network are still running client software vulnerable to the inflation bug discovered in September 2018.

This revelation poses some danger to the network, as software vulnerabilities are a clear and present danger to the fidelity of bitcoin (BTC). Now that the top-ranked cryptocurrency is in the midst of a positive price run, it is perhaps important that steps are taken to eradicate the inflation bug problem for good.

Most bitcoin full nodes still vulnerable to the inflation bug

As reported by Cointelegraph on May 8, research by Dashjr shows that more than 50% of full nodes on the bitcoin network are still running software versions of the bitcoin client that are susceptible to the inflation bug.

However, from that time, the figure has fallen slightly from about 60% to 54%. This means that, in the last few days, some full nodes have upgraded to a more recent client software update.

Back in September 2018, developers first discovered the inflation bug — which, in theory, could allow miners to inflate the total bitcoin supply beyond the 21 million BTC by spending multiple unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the same transaction.

Given the nature of the bug, the developers kept it a secret, quietly releasing a new version of the client. An excerpt from the September 2018 common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) report released by Bitcoincore.org reads:

“In order to encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious Denial of Service vulnerability, concurrently with reaching out to miners, businesses, and other affected systems while delaying publication of the full issue to give times for systems to upgrade. On September 20th a post in a public forum reported the full impact and although it was quickly retracted the claim was further circulated.”

One key takeaway from Dashjr’s analysis is the total number of full nodes on the bitcoin network. Most bitcoin literature sources put the number of full-node numbers at somewhere approaching 10,000.

However, Dashjr opines that this number is closer to 100,000 and that the reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that many sources only account for nodes actively listening on the network.

Called listening nodes, these full nodes have open port connections that can be probed. However, not all full-nodes are listening nodes; some, hidden behind firewalls or configured to not actively listen for new connections, don’t have easily discoverable open port connections.

The severity of the inflation bug

To understand the severity of the inflation bug, it is important to know the mechanism by which the problem could be exploited. This process would involve a summary explaining of the double-spend attack, the inflation bug itself and the problems that could arise if left unchecked.

Bitcoin’s early success lends itself greatly to Satoshi Nakamoto’s — the creator of bitcoin — brilliant solution to the double-spending problem that had prevented the successful deployment and implementation of prior virtual currency systems.

By creating an immutable ledger with nodes validating transactions, it became almost theoretically impossible to spend the same UTXO in two different transactions.

However, what happens when, instead of spending the UTXO in two different transactions, a malicious actor tries to use one transaction to spend UTXO multiple times? Because of the way bitcoin is engineered to work, this action would mean creating new coins virtually out of thin air, thus inflating the total supply — ergo, the inflation bug.

Several successive updates to the bitcoin software have tried to improve the blockchain’s immunity to the first type of double-spend attack. However, by the Core 0.14.x version of the bitcoin software client, developers began to notice there was a possibility of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) vulnerability in the software client.

The bug allowed a malicious attacker to crash nodes running the 0.14.x software version by attempting to spend the same UTXO twice. In this iteration of the bug, the objective would have been to crash as many nodes as possible and not necessarily inflate the total bitcoin supply.

In trying to fix the problem, the next released update, 0.15.0, included features that inadvertently allowed a malicious attacker to double spend the same UTXO in one transaction. Instead of causing a system crash, this new bug caused older software clients to recognize such double-spend transactions as valid.

Upon discovery, developers again released a new version of software before announcing it to the wider cryptocurrency community. However, several months after the issue ought to have been solved, it appears that more than half the full nodes on the network are still running client implementations vulnerable to the bug.

Cointelegraph spoke with Dashjr about the implication of the inflation bug, to which the bitcoin developer replied:

“The inflation bug is in practice a network-wide risk. It would allow a 51% miner attack to cause inflation (something such attacks can't normally do). The inflationary chain would only be accepted by vulnerable nodes and light wallets.”

Expanding further on the dangers posed by the bug, Dashjr went on to say:

“It makes what was thought to be a full node, actually just a light wallet in that one respect. If more than a small minority use light wallets, miners get to make up the rules.”

All nodes have to do is upgrade

Whenever developers discover a bug of this nature, the solution is always to get nodes to upgrade to a newer version of software that hopefully has features that eliminate the problem. Sometimes, this process may lead to the emergence of another problem — as seen in 2018, when solving the DDoS bug caused the inflation bug to manifest.

When asked by Cointelegraph what should be done about the situation, Dashjr’s answer was simple and straight to the point:

“Everyone upgrading to a fixed full node.”

While this process is ongoing, does the bitcoin network face any credible risk stemming from the fact that half of the full nodes are vulnerable to the inflation bug? The answer to the question might lie in who really holds the true power in the network: miners or developers?

In 2018, bitcoin developer, Jimmy Song expressed the view that rogue miners trying to take advantage of the inflation bug would find it nearly impossible to succeed. For one, Song said that not every full node runs the bitcoin core, a large number prefer to deploy custom iterations of the bitcoin client.

The fact that some nodes do not run the core client already diminishes the attack because such nodes will reject the block containing the inflated UTXOs. If a significant number of miners reject the tainted block, then a chain split likely occurs.

Back in 2010, during the “value overflow incident” discovered in block 74,638, developers published a new update to the client in less than five hours, solving the problem. The block in question contained a transaction that created about 184 billion BTC for three addresses, with two addresses receiving 92.2 billion BTC and the miner responsible for solving the block getting 0.01 BTC.

The discrepancy only lasted for the next 53 blocks, and by block height 74,691, all traces of the value of overflow no longer existed on the network. Nodes that initially accepted the chain split with the tainted block soon began to revert to the chain split that didn’t contain the inflated block.

The same applies to the inflation bug: Once the split occurs, developers and others on the network would begin to notice, as Song explained in this excerpt of his blog post, which reads:

“Because of these irregularities, people on the network would soon have tracked this down, probably have alerted some developers and the core developers would have fixed it. If there was a fork, the social consensus at that point about which is the right chain would start getting discussed and the chain creating unexpected inflation would have likely lost out. If there was a stall, there likely would have been a voluntary rollback to punish the attacker.”

For Song, given the economics of the attack, it is unlikely that rogue miners would want to employ such a tactic. However, the bitcoin educator said that hackers working for countries with anti-bitcoin sentiments could exploit the bug to destroy the network.",,https://www.ccn.com/facebook-unexpectedly-crypto-friendly-switzerland/,"

Facebook has been unusually quiet about choosing crypto-friendly Switzerland to domicile Libra Networks, a blockchain-fueled fintech play. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: Facebook has reportedly set up a fintech company dubbed Libra Networks in Switzerland. The move clearly correlates with the social media giant’s Project Libra.

According to Reuters, the focus of the fintech is on the blockchain, payments, data analytics, and investing.

Libra Networks, which was registered in Geneva on May 2, will provide financial and technology services. Also in its wheelhouse will be developing related hardware and software.

Another Secret Move

Famed investor Michael Novogratz recently called Project Libra “stunningly important” to the crypto space.

Given Facebook’s history of boasting about its projects, you’d think it would be bragging about Project Libra. That’s not the case. The Switzerland move was done with no fanfare such as company press releases or blog posts. This seems to be the way Facebook has chosen to roll out its Project Libra.

It’s keeping close to the chest even where the project will be launched. In December, it hinted at plans to set up shop in India. Early reports suggest Zuckerberg’s cryptocurrency will facilitate overseas remittance payments for Indian WhatsApp users.

Curiosity Grows

Facebook launched Project Libra more than a year ago to allow money transfers between WhatsApp users. Over time, however, the scope of the project has expanded. That includes the decision to include e-commerce payments on Facebook and other websites as well as rewards for viewing ads, shopping online, and interacting with content.

When all is done, Facebook hopes to have a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of a local currency.

Switzerland has long been recognized as a leading hub of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, with the Swiss town of Zug referred to as “Crypto Valley” throughout the world.

Facebook’s popular messaging app with 1.5 billion users in over 180 countries has another major vulnerability. Hackers were able to covertly install spyware on iOS and Android smartphones using Whatsapp with just a phone call. “All of their security issues are conveniently suitable for surveillance, and look and work a lot like backdoors,” said Telegram’s founder, who doubts Whatsapp will ever be secure.

A Phone Call Is All It Takes

Whatsapp and its parent company, Facebook, revealed last week that a major vulnerability had been discovered in the popular messaging service and urged users to update the app. The Financial Times reported that this latest vulnerability in Whatsapp had been open for weeks, allowing hackers to inject Israeli spyware onto mobile phones simply by calling targets, noting:

The malicious code, developed by the secretive Israeli company NSO Group, could be transmitted even if users did not answer their phones, and the calls often disappeared from call logs.

The publication further detailed, “Within minutes of the missed call, the phone starts revealing its encrypted content, mirrored on a computer screen halfway across the world. It then transmits back the most intimate details such as private messages and location, and even turns on the camera and microphone to live-stream meetings.” The news outlet added that “The software itself is not new — it was the latest upgrade to a decade-old technology so powerful that the Israeli defence ministry regulates its sale. But the Whatsapp hack was an enticing new ‘attack vector.'”

While the hackers who gained access by exploiting the vulnerability in Whatsapp’s call functionality have not been identified at press time, the company clarified in a statement:

The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems.

Whatsapp is a free messaging and voice over IP service which allows users to send text messages, images, documents, and other media, as well as place voice and video calls. It was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for $19 billion. In July last year, Whatsapp said it had more than 1.5 billion users in over 180 countries, making it the most popular messaging app worldwide.

Alarming Number of Users Are Unaware

Both Facebook and Whatsapp have not said much about this latest hack. Moreover, instead of notifying users directly about the problem, Whatsapp issued a statement through the press urging people to update the software. This has led to an alarming number of users failing to update the app, according to smartphone security company Wandera which helps clients secure their employees’ smartphones. Its clients include Rolex, Deloitte, General Electric, and Bloomberg. The company manages over 1 million devices, 30% of which have Whatsapp installed.

As of Thursday, Wandera found that a whopping 80.2% of iOS and 55.4% of Android devices out of its managed devices had not been updated. Whatsapp is investigating the vulnerability but said that it is too early to estimate how many phones were targeted using this method, a person familiar with the issue told the Financial Times.

The NSO Group

The Israeli company that developed the software which allegedly exploits Whatsapp’s vulnerability said it was investigating the allegations but “Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies,” the company said in a statement Tuesday.

The group makes hacking tools primarily for intelligence agencies in the west and the middle east. Its flagship product, Pegasus, is designed to enable a phone’s microphone and camera, sift through emails and messages and also access location data.

“NSO’s technology is licensed to authorized government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror. The company does not operate the system, and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions,” the group explained. CNBC reported the group claiming that it does not use the hacking tools itself, and that the tools are “solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.”

Nonetheless, The Guardian wrote Saturday that the firm is facing a lawsuit backed by Amnesty International, as the organization says it fears its staff may be under surveillance from spyware installed via the Whatsapp messaging service. The paper described:

It has called on the country’s ministry of defence to ban the export of NSO’s Pegasus software, which can covertly take control of a mobile phone, copy its data and turn on the microphone for surveillance.

Sending Cryptocurrencies Through Whatsapp

This vulnerability was revealed at a time when Whatsapp has gained attention from the crypto community as a platform to develop services on. Cryptocurrency startup Wuabit is a chatbot assistant and cryptocurrency wallet accessible via the chat interface of Whatsapp. On March 26, Wuabit tweeted confirming “its business API integration” with the popular chat platform after a report by The Express the day before that the app’s public beta was due to start in April. “We are near completing the wallet core service starting with BTC,” a spokesman for the company told the news outlet.

Using the app, users can simply type in commands such as “send 0.05 BTC to Vera” and the cryptocurrency will be automatically sent from the user’s Wuabit wallet after a quick confirmation. In addition to Whatsapp, “more chat platforms will be added such as Telegram, FB Messenger, [and] Viber,” the service’s website proclaims.

Why Whatsapp May Never Be Secure

Following the news of Whatsapp’s latest vulnerability, Telegram founder Pavel Durov shared his thoughts on the subject. “Everything on your phone, including photos, emails and texts was accessible by attackers just because you had Whatsapp installed,” he began.

The entrepreneur founded Russia’s largest social network, VK, in 2006. After leaving the company as the CEO in 2014, he left Russia and concentrated on Telegram Messenger as a direct response to personal pressure from the Russian government to put a back door in his earlier project. Telegram is an open source, strongly-encrypted competitor to Whatsapp.

Durov was not surprised to hear of the latest vulnerability as he recalled Whatsapp admitting to having a similar issue last year. “Whatsapp’s closed-source code will perpetually keep it a target for hackers,” he asserted. “They do the exact opposite: Whatsapp deliberately obfuscates their apps’ binaries to make sure no one is able to study them thoroughly.” The Telegram founder said:

Every time Whatsapp has to fix a critical vulnerability in their app, a new one seems to appear in its place. All of their security issues are conveniently suitable for surveillance, and look and work a lot like backdoors.

According to Whatsapp, end-to-end encryption was implemented in 2016 “for all messaging and calling on Whatsapp so that no one, not even us, has access to the content of your conversations,” its website states. However, Durov calls this a marketing ploy, alleging that “at least several governments, including the Russians,” have the keys needed to decrypt all Whatsapp content.

Mike Campin, VP of Engineering at Wandera, believes that “Whatsapp’s ‘end-to-end-encryption’ badge certainly shouldn’t be mistaken as a guarantee that communications are secure.”

Durov continued by describing how Whatsapp started with no encryption at all and then suffered a “succession of security issues strangely suitable for surveillance purposes,” elaborating:

There hasn’t been a single day in Whatsapp’s 10 year journey when this service was secure … That’s why I don’t think that just updating Whatsapp’s mobile app will make it secure for anyone.

“For Whatsapp to become a privacy-oriented service, it has to risk losing entire markets and clashing with authorities in their home country. They don’t seem to be ready for that,” the entrepreneur concluded.

Bitcoin corrected its price and lost 10% of its value overnight, but that might not be a sign of more heartbreak to come; the volatility we’ve seen during the month of May be a positive indicator.

This correction could have been worse, and as Dovey Wan pointed out on Twitter, this had little to do with BTC fundamentals, and everything to do with a large trader seemingly gaming the market.

Remember, BTC started at a price of $5,350 on May 1st, 2019 according to CoinMarketCap, so we’re still on an upward trend. As the price of BTC increases, the effective value (percentage wise) of a $1,000 move in the price becomes smaller and smaller.

The image below from Coin Metrics data shows the price of BTC in the shaded area compared to BTC volatility, and there’s a clear positive relationship between price and volatility. This makes sense intuitively because volatility attracts more traders – there are more profit opportunities. This has a cyclical effect, because it brings more volume (and hopefully buyers) into the market.

Before the last bull run, the volatility level for BTC was at the same level that it is at now on July 20th, 2017 when the price of BTC was $2,300. Five months later, on December 20th, 2017 the price of BTC was $17,700, and volatility continued to increase until reaching an apex in February 2018, lagging the apex in price by approximately 60 days.

BTC volatility reached a local minimum on November 14th 2018 when the price of Bitcoin was $6,350:

This bottom-out in volatility preceded the local bottom in the price of BTC that happened on December 15th ($3250) by 31 days.

Since hitting that bottom-out in volatility, the price of BTC has increased by 23% and the volatility has increased by 42%…

This is very early analysis into the relationship between BTC volatility and BTC price, but a hypothesis we’ll be watching for is that:

Local maximums in volatility lag local maximums in price

Local minimums in volatility precede strong bull rallies

There isn’t enough historical data on BTC to come to a concrete conclusion, but we’re hypothesizing that this recent spike in volatility (after a low bearishness in price and volatility) is a bull indicator, and we hope to see volatility increasing week over week to continue bitcoin’s upward trend.

It’s just a market correction – it’s not going to be smooth sailing on the bull market boat, but dips should be expected.",2019-05-19 16:41:13+00:00

Since Bitcoin set sail in 2009, cryptocurrencies have made waves across the globe. The big question on everyone’s lips – What will these coins be worth in the future?

After the price of Bitcoin surged in May 2019, we asked a panel of 10 fintech leaders their thoughts on Bitcoin’s rise, including whether they think consumers should buy, hold or sell and what might be in store for the cryptocurrency. Predictions are speculative and reflect the panelists’ views and opinions, which can change over time. Predictions are not a recommendation to trade, and you shouldn’t rely on them for the purposes of trading. Do your own research or seek advice.

Why the price of Bitcoin is up

Eight out of 10 panelists think the price of Bitcoin increased due to crypto-related announcements made at Consensus 2019 in New York City, such as those by Bakkt and Microsoft.

BitBull Capital chief operating officer Sarah Bergstrand says,

“The past three years, a few weeks before Blockchain Week, we have seen the rising of prices and of the overall market cap, especially during the three-day Consensus conference. It also tends to fall as soon as the conference is over.”

Digital Capital Management chief operating officer Ben Ritchie puts it this way,

“The rise in the price of Bitcoin on the surface appears to be a result of the release of positive news flowing from Consensus this year. However, there may be some additional underlying factors. These include the stability of Bitfinex and the USDT following their recent $850 million raise in 10 days, and Binance looking to buy back their BTC position following the hack of 7,074 BTC. There is also an increased use of algorithmic trading pushing volumes significantly higher and fueling confidence – and, with it, opportunity.”

The next most-cited factors were US-China trade tensions (50%) and the impending reduction in Bitcoin emission, also known as the halvening (50%).

Arca chief investment officer Jeff Dorman says there’s “not one specific reason” for Bitcoin’s rally.

“It’s mosaic theory. Pent-up demand spilled out because of Fidelity’s new platform, China’s trade wars, short liquidations and Bitfinex’s forced buying from people who bought BTC with USDT in order to get out of USDT.”

Three panelists say the price surge is due to institutional investors embracing cryptocurrency, while two say it’s because retail investors believe it’s a good time to buy.

Ajay Shresthra, a PhD candidate at the University of Saskatchewan, suggests that as NASDAQ prepares for cryptocurrency trading on its exchange, it’s contributing to the price surge. Nafis Alam, associate professor at Henley Business School, says another factor may be an impending financial crisis, while Rouge Ventures managing director Desmond Marshall thinks Russia going full force in supporting crypto is a key reason for the price surge.

Bitcoin price predictions

Bitcoin is predicted to hit $7,543 by June 1st, according to the average of our panelists’ predictions. (Where panelists predicted a price range, we used the middle figure to calculate the panel average. Where panelists gave only an upper limit, we used that figure to calculate the average.)

Both Bergstrand and WishKnish CEO Alisa Gus think Bitcoin will be as high as $8,500 on June 1st, while Alam is more conservative, predicting the price at between $5,500 and $6,000.

When asked about a price forecast for Bitcoin by the end of the year, our panelists predicted an average $9,659 by December 31st. Here too, Alam’s prediction is conservative at $4,000 at the end of December. Technologist Joseph Raczynski predicts the highest end-of-year price at $17,000.

Dorman declined to predict a price, saying,

“Making short-term price predictions isn’t practical. Making probability-weighted investment decisions is better. And right now, it is a good risk–reward to continue to accumulate BTC. One BTC will always equal 1 BTC. Pricing BTC in terms of USD is dependent on a lot of things, including the inevitable weakness of the USD caused by unsustainable debt and inflation.”

How high will Bitcoin go?

Only 40% of our panelists think Bitcoin will exceed its all-time high of around $20,000 in this bull run. Interestingly, panelists are divided on whether a crash similar to the one we saw in December 2017 will soon follow, with 50% of panelists responding yes to this question and 50% responding no.

What does this mean for consumers?

When asked if they think consumers should buy, hold or sell Bitcoin, 50% of our panelists said buy, while 30% said hold and 20% said sell.

Fred Schebesta, founder of Crypto Finder and HiveEx, is one panelist who thinks it could be a good time to buy. “If you believe in Bitcoin and its past, it’s the low time,” he says.

Ritchie appears to agree.

“The fundamentals of Bitcoin improved significantly during the bear market, despite negative sentiment suppressing the price. The utility and adoption of Bitcoin has increased during this period. And now that sentiment has returned, so does its medium to long outlook.”

Dorman suggests consumers should be consistent in their strategy.

“Timing the market isn’t the goal. It’s prudent to buy now, buy if it goes down and buy if it goes up. A consistent strategy over time is the best way to gain exposure without trying to pick bottoms or tops.”

Gus is a panelist who suggests that consumers hold.

“I feel like BTC is back where it belongs, in the $6K to $10K range,” she explains. “And while, eventually, I do see it rising past $10K for a long-term gain, it shouldn’t be anytime soon — if it does, it is unlikely to hold on to that level for long. Let the market rest a bit after the rally.”

Instructor at Programming Blockchain, Jimmy Song, and Raczynski also suggest that consumers hold. Song says,

“Bitcoin has real decentralized scarcity. Long term, it’s a good bet.”

And Raczynski says,

“I do believe BTC is going higher, but the run-up over the last three weeks has been huge. BTC historically runs in spurts, but there are rumors that whales are prepping to sell nearly a billion in BTC, ETH and Ripple. Flush them out, and in time BTC will rise.”

Alam is one of the two panelists who says sell.

“It’s a temporary surge,” he explains. “Nothing much has changed in the Bitcoin feature. It was a speculative instrument and will remain ever [thus].”

The other panelist who suggests selling, Shrestha, says simply,

“Good times may not last.”

“Over the past few days, the actual price has moved sharply over marginal cost,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note obtained by Bloomberg. “This divergence between actual and intrinsic values carries some echoes of the spike higher in late 2017, and at the time this divergence was resolved mostly by a reduction in actual prices.”

To come to this conclusion, the JP Morgan team treated Bitcoin as a commodity, calculating its “cost of production” based on a number of factors, including estimated computational power, electricity expense, and hardware energy efficiency.

“Defining an intrinsic or fair value for any cryptocurrency is clearly challenging,” the analysts continued. “Indeed, views range from some researchers arguing that it has no fundamental value, to others estimating fair values well in excess of current prices.”

Bitcoin‘s price briefly dropped from almost $8,000 to $7,050 on May 17, after $250 million of long positions got liquidated on BitMEX. Since then, BTC has surged back to $7,893 at the time of writing.

Users of major instant messaging platform WhatsApp can now send and receive Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH), via this program by using the Lite.IM bot, developed by Swiss blockchain startup Zulu Republic, the company announced on Sunday. (Updated on May 24: updates in bold.)

A screenshot of the bot.

Smartphone users need to add Lite.Im WhatsApp bot, after which they just need to follow the screen prompts as they will receive a set of instructions on transferring their desired coins. Users can tweak the options, choose a language (for now only English or Spanish), set a password, and set a default coin between four options: BTC, LTC, ETH, and the startup’s native token, Zulu Republic Token (ZTX). Also, people can earn cryptocurrency via a referral program.

Lite.IM already offers services for Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and regular SMS. As a matter of fact, Zulu Republic first introduced their Litecoin platform Lite.im in August 2018 via which “with a simple Telegram or SMS message, Lite.IM users can interact with the Litecoin blockchain, sending and receiving funds from anywhere in the world where a cellular signal can be found,” according to their blog post. In January 2019, the company announced that the platform now allows purchases of digital tokens directly in Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or by SMS with a credit or debit card.

This came as Facebook, a company that owns WhatsApp, is working on its own digital coin.

As reported in March, Spain-based independent startup Wuabit also aims to help WhatsApp users to send and receive cryptocurrencies simply by chatting with the AI. The company planned to launch a limited public beta in April, but there were no updates on the progress since then.

""We've been delayed due to some production glitches and our main provider with WhatsApp it's delayed too. We want quality first, being in crypto/finance world this is of utmost importance,"" Wuabit CEO Manuel Polo told Cryptonews.com.

""[Lite.IM] has a nice and simpler product, we're AI based so it could help give us a leap step ahead of all competitors,"" he added.

Meanwhile, security concerns have been raised as WhatsApp, that has 1.6 billion users, was reportedly hacked just a few days ago, as was first reported on by the Financial Times. According to their May 14th report, the messaging application has been breached by a spyware called Pegasus, allegedly developed by an Israel-based cyber-intelligence company NSO in an attempt to gain information from the phone of a UK-based human rights lawyer. Once affected, the spyware can access the user’s data and sensitive information, including calls, texts, and photos, as well as microphone and camera. Facebook was criticized for their slow reaction to this breach, lack of transparency, and failure to notify the users of the issue as soon as it was discovered. The company has posted a short security message and gave statements to certain media outlets acknowledging the incident and asking users to update WhatsApp.",,https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/20/18631886/ripple-brad-garlinghouse-banks-bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-xrp-kara-swisher-podcast-interview,"Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

Terms like “bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” used to be linked with techno-anarchists who wanted an anonymous way to sell drugs and weapons on the internet, via online marketplaces like the Silk Road. So Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was encouraged when regular people started speculating in tokens a few years ago.

“That’s actually forward progress,” he said on the latest episode of Recode Decode with Kara Swisher. “You went from illicit activity to speculation, and today you’re going from speculation to utility.”

Part of Garlinghouse’s job is to convince legitimate financial institutions — including banking goliaths like Citibank and Deutsche Bank — that crypto is an inevitable part of their industry’s future, albeit maybe not their immediate future. Ripple sells software to those institutions to let them transact on blockchain, which may one day give them access to the billions of “unbanked” people who currently lack a convenient way of moving that money across borders.

So unlike the earliest adopters of bitcoin, Garlinghouse has no interest in ensuring that crypto holders can always remain anonymous. And he doesn’t expect that legacy institutions such as banks and governments will be obliterated by the new technology.

“We want to change the system by working with the system,” he said. “These are profound technologies that can really benefit society in lots of ways. We can reduce the friction of global commerce, we can allow people globally more access to the economies around the world to compete. I think that’s actually a really good thing.”

You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, and Overcast.

Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Brad.

Kara Swisher: Hi, I’m Kara Swisher, editor-at-large of Recode. You may know me as someone who traded all my bitcoin for a pair of cool sunglasses because you can’t wear bitcoin, but in my spare time I talk tech, and you’re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast Network.

Today in the red chair, I’m so excited to have Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple. I knew him when he was other things, but now he’s the CEO of Ripple, which is an online exchange for tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, and more. He previously was CEO of Hightail. That was a bad period, wasn’t it?

Brad Garlinghouse: That was a wind in your face trying to turn something around.

All right. Whatever.

Funny, that the description of Ripple at that ...

Welcome to Recode Decode. All right. How would you like me to describe it? You describe it for me.

We’re not an exchange.

What are you? How would you describe it?

Ripple is effectively an enterprise software company selling blockchain and crypto technologies to banks, payment providers, financial institutions globally, to solve a cross-border payments problem.

Oh, that’s well done. Very nice. So we’re going to talk about your journey, Brad, because let’s talk ... Thank you for correcting me, immediately. That’s a nice thing for you to do. So let’s go through your history, because people know you from a lot of other things, right? You were ... Where did you start? I forget.

My first job in Silicon Valley, I moved out here in 1997 and joined a company called the @Home Network.

You were at @Home.

Old-school. You were at the Wall Street Journal in those days.

Yes. I was trying to take that company down. That was a full of suspect characters. Who ran it?

There were a lot of really — Tom Jermoluk, TJ.

Oh him. Ay-yi-yi. That guy.

Anyway, regardless of what you thought of him ...

He liked to sell stock and talk up the company, that’s what I remember of him.

What’s cool for me to think about is, I mean, the @Home Network as much as it maybe ...

Explain to people what it was. It was a great idea.

Well, not just a great idea. It was the first company to roll out cable modems. You think about how dependent we are, I mean, we went, @Home really had a major impact in moving people from dial-up to broadband.

Yes, they did.

And they probably catalyzed ...

[dial-up noise]

Exactly.

Right.

But they also probably catalyzed the telephone companies to more aggressively engage in DSL.

They did. Do you remember the fights with AT&T and everyone else? So they originally had the cable and then they merged inexplicably with Excite. And then it was Excite@Home, which was the concept of putting the portals together with the high-speed networks. AOL was trying that at Time Warner, it didn’t work out. It never worked out. Why didn’t you go there? What was the concept?

Well, at pre-business school, I had been at SBC Communications, which now is AT&T, and had been involved with rolling out ISDN. Now, at the time, ISDN, like that was super fast.

That was fast.

That was fast.

Yeah.

So I was familiar with the challenge of just broadband connectivity and twisted pair and the limitations. And I read this article ...

And SBC was big. I wrote about it at the Washington Post.

Indeed.

ISDN, I can’t get those days back. I have to tell you, all the time spent.

You don’t look like you’ve aged a day.

I just want to say, I cannot imagine, I wrote about ISDN so much back then and now I’d forgotten until you just mentioned it.

Yeah, I don’t know, I can’t remember what it stands for right now. But anyway, I read an article in Wired Magazine while I was at business school about John Malone and John Doerr talking about leveraging coaxial cable to deliver broadband.

John Malone, a legend too.

And I cold-called the board members of the starting — it was when Will Hearst was CEO of @Home and I got myself an internship there. Actually, I was technically an intern at TCI, of the big cable company that’s also long gone.

There was another one, yeah.

We’re dating ourselves.

I know we are, but that’s okay. So you did that and then you worked at @Home and then went over to Yahoo, right?

No, in between there I was at a company called Dialpad doing Voice Over IP.

Oh, damn. Oh, my God.

Yeah. Early days of VoIP.

Jesus, you’ve hit them all, haven’t you? Yikes. What happened to DialPad?

Well, it was a good fit for me because I was a telco guy. This was obviously pre-Skype and connected phone era and that was, I mean, on the one hand, things were a lot of consumer adoption, but at a time when the dot-com crash was crashing upon us.

Sure. I’m only making you do this. I want them to understand that you were always at the forefront of some sketchy stuff.

And trying new stuff.

But some interesting early steps.

Sketchy, anyway, a long story short, trying to shorten this chapter, I ended up at Yahoo. Yahoo bought Dialpad. I had a long run at Yahoo.

You had a famous run at Yahoo. What did you run there?

It can be famous and long.

Yes, yes. We have to talk of peanut butter, you know that, that’s how everyone knows you. So you were at Yahoo, what did you do there?

Nobody knows about peanut butter anymore. That’s a long time ago.

Yes, they do. I know now you’re the rich CEO of Ripple. I get that. But I’m just saying you did ... It was a big moment when you talked about that because it was the first time people were talking about innovation problems within a company that was successful.

Yeah.

It was, it was one of the first times because everything was up and to the right with internet...

I loved my experience at Yahoo. They were, I mean, as I was just talking about on the way into your studio here. The diaspora of Yahoo alums is a really impressive, great group of people.

It is.

The first handful of years I was at Yahoo, it was up and to the right. And I remember going into weekly staff meetings and every time you’re up in our forecast in there, we could do no wrong. But you did start to see cracks in the ice. And I think — as is true in all of life — the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one. I think Yahoo was a little bit slow in acknowledging it had one. Despite your pointing it out.

Yeah, I tried to do it on a daily basis, yeah. What prompted you to write that memo? You’ve talked about it before.

Yeah, I’ve talked a little about it. I mean, the actual thing that happened was there’s an article in the New York Times. As I recall, it was a Tuesday, and a gentleman, Saul Hansell from the New York Times, wrote an article about Yahoo, and later that day ... We used to do with the executive staff, there’s a daily, we call it a stand-up meeting where you just check in for 15 minutes in a stand-up meeting. And at that meeting, there was a kvetching about this New York Times article. And I think at the meeting I was probably, if not the lone voice, a relatively speaking lone voice and saying, “no, actually there’s some really good points here.”

And at the time my then boss, I think to mostly get me to shut up, said, “Why don’t you write down what you think.” And out of that little seed came the Peanut Butter Manifesto.

Oh, you ran with it. Which you talked about the idea that you get covered with peanut butter. Right?

Well, the peanut butter analogy actually also came from the budgeting process at Yahoo because someone had said during the budgeting process that we spread our resources around like peanut butter and everybody gets some. And I remember I used that metaphor as like, that’s what’s wrong. And I think even today in life…

You prioritize.

Yeah, you got to decide, you can’t be all things to all people. That’s true in all parts of business and for personal, professional. And I think Yahoo was too slow to let go of trying to be all things to all people and things that weren’t working.

And it meant that things that were working got underinvested in. Things that weren’t working well, the kind of good money after bad. And look, I, there’s a lot to love about the Yahoo experience and that was a very difficult time and place. I think a lot of smart people were trying to address it, including after I left, Carol Bartz came in and then Marissa and I’m sure I think, oh Scott Thompson.

That didn’t go well.

But as I look back, I do think so much of innovation is born out of the culture of an organization.

Sure.

And a culture that encourages risk and tolerates failure is, I think, a culture that will yield innovation. Because you’ve got to take chances, you got to take risks. And it’s okay that some of the risks fail.

So speaking of which, you went to Hightail, right? To run ...

After Yahoo, I have actually spent about a year at an investment [firm] called Silver Lake.

Yes, that’s right. One of those parking lot jobs, right?

And it was kind of an adviser. I didn’t think it was a parking lot...

What did you do, have lunch? What happens during lunch?

It was a lovely lunch.

What really happens during those things? You just sort of sit around and get cappuccino? Mochachino?

They had beautiful offices.

They do. I’ve been there. They have nice lunches.

They do, I agree with that as well.

Yeah. So, why?

Well, they hadn’t yet at that point done what I would say you and I would define as an internet deal. And they’d obviously done a lot in the tech space, but they had looked at but not done an internet deal. And the idea was, hey, you know, I thought maybe I knew something about the internet and I can maybe be helpful as they’re looking at things. And I think they’re also, maybe they would buy something, I’d go in and run it. It’s just kind of, uh, you know, maybe pejoratively you called it a parking lot job, but directionally fair.

Whatever. Come on.

It was super interesting though.

I gotta look at being an EIR, because I want to sleep. That’s what my whole thing...

Yeah, but the private equity guys don’t call them EIRs. They call them senior advisers. It’s the same ...

They’re all over there. That’s Egon, right?

Egon Durban, although he was in London at the time. Mike Bingle, I looked at him or deals with, and they did Skype while I was there...

Yeah, that ended well. So you were CEO of Hightail then. This was a company ... I was fascinated by this move by you.

Well, you’re also missing another chapter, which you will greatly enjoy. I went to work for your friend Tim Armstrong.

Oh my God. You were at AOL! Oh my God! I forgot, everyone was there, right?

Well that was ... yeah, Tim did a really good job, I think, bringing in some really interesting people. I think all of Tim’s direct reports, probably ...

What did you do there?

The same kind of stuff I did at Yahoo and I read the homepage. I had mail and the communication products.

I just had him onstage talking about his new cockamamie idea. I’m sorry. Fascinating idea.

Retail, I recall.

It’s direct to consumer, DTC. His new thing.

It’s retail.

Yeah, but it’s direct to consumer, like Glossier kind of stuff. Yeah, whatever. I love that he always comes up with something.

Clever guy, for sure.

So you were at AOL doing that and then you went off and did Hightail?

Correct.

Trying to get you to Ripple as soon as I can but go ahead.

So Hightail ...

What we’re finding out is that you had a lot of jobs, Brad Garlinghouse.

Is that good or bad?

Whatever.

Yahoo was the longest tenure of the jobs I’ve had in Silicon Valley, but it’s been a bunch of interesting stuff and Hightail, for those of you familiar with it, was a cloud based storage.

It was called something else.

It was called YouSendIt when I joined and I felt like ...

You didn’t like the name.

Yeah.

Remember you sent me the name Hightail and I made fun of it?

I can’t imagine you would do that.

Yes I did. I had like a dirty remark, I think, around the word Hightail. But anyway.

That doesn’t sound anything like you.

Why did you like the concept of cloud storage?

Well, I think consistently I’ve tried to look at what are the big macro trends happening? And I think, local storage felt like it was dying and eroding and then YouSendIt had a large user base that you could potentially ...

Right.

But it was a turnaround, and in the face of Google Drive and Dropbox and Box, we were a pipsqueak trying to swim upstream. And there’s a famous Buffett saying that “most turnarounds don’t turn,” which I feel like I’ve learned the hard way.

I had dinner with him.

That would be fascinating. That would be on my bucket list, for sure.

I don’t eat red meat very much and I had a giant steak. That’s all I have to say about that entire dinner. You know who I went with? Sue Decker.

Oh, I love Sue!

I know, another Yahoo.

She’s good people.

Had a good time. He’s everything and more, he’s all that and a bag of chips.

He seems very bright.

He’s exactly the way you’d imagine him. Except there is a lot more sugar than I realized going on. Like more sugar and meat and butter. That was the only...

He owns Dairy Queen.

Yeah. There’s a lot of ice cream happening or Coca-Cola happening. There’s steak, there’s butter everywhere. Otherwise, it was enjoyable. It was a highly enjoyable time.

Good.

He’s really quite a legend. Anyway, back to you. So how did you get to Ripple? I don’t really know this story. I don’t understand it. I know, you’ve talked about it a little bit, explain to the people how did it ... what I want to get [through to] people is, you can shift from one thing to the other. So local/cloud storage was really important. Was a conceptually important, right?

It was a computing shift.

Which you identified correctly.

Yeah, probably right about the shift and wrong ...

Directionally correct. All right. So how ...

I was frankly ... I had left Hightail and I was Uber driving and I thought that ...

Did it come to that, Brad? You were just doing it? Why? An experiment?

I was fascinated by the sharing economy and...

What was your number? What did you get? Like 3.2?

Actually, it’s funny you ... 3.2! That hurts, Kara.

I have a terrible score in Uber. Let me just say.

That tells a lot about you. I just thought actually interviewing people at Ripple, we should ask people’s Uber score or Lyft score.

Yeah.

It’s an interesting ... like how do you treat people, when people aren’t looking?

No.

I did not have a five-star rating at the end. I did it for a month and I thought for sure that I’d have a five-star rating, but somebody didn’t like me.

Why did you do this? Just to see how it works?

I was just fascinated, yeah. I am frankly, I had a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas of starting a company in the sharing economy space. I was talking to Uber about potentially joining the company and, well anyway, the only reason I tell you that story is, I was driving an Uber and I got a recruiting call from a recruiter who I knew and I liked and he said, “Hey, this company Ripple is looking for a COO. Have you heard of it?” And I lied and said I had.

Okay, well done.

And I tried to wave him off honestly, because he described what the company is doing and I said, “Well look, I don’t know about payments. You should call — I know some people at PayPal or Visa.” And he said, “No, have you ever met this guy Chris Larsen? He’s the co-founder of the company. He wants to hire somebody from outside of the system,” with the idea being that, if you’re from inside the system you don’t necessarily see the opportunities in the same way.

And so, I had some time on my hands and so I went and spent some time with Chris and Chris is a brilliant, fascinating guy who, honestly, he knows that, he’s heard me say this, but the first meeting, I came out of it and I was like, “I have no idea he’s talking about but he might be onto something. And I’m totally fascinated.”

Sounds like of all Silicon Valley. That’s a VC remark, essentially. Why did you think he was onto something? What struck you? Did you have a thought about this area? Bitcoin and the whole area.

Yeah. Through my friend network, I had invested in bitcoin. A friend, Dave Goldberg, had kind of twisted my arm and said, “You really should own bitcoin.” I bought some bitcoin, but the pitch around Ripple was always that there are limitations of trying to go around the government or attack the banks.

Right.

And isn’t there a way you could partner with the government and with the banks and with finance institutions?

Now, bitcoin wasn’t a big thing then. It was a medium thing. It was like a little trend...

It was pretty small at the time.

I only heard it from Katie Mitic and then, what’s his name, the Xapo guy?

Wences.

Wences.

Fabulous guy.

Who’s everyone’s friend. Right. He got you all into it. Right? Wences Casares.

Well, so I was intrigued. And in talking to Chris, I thought that he had a pragmatic, thoughtful way of hey, how do we approach this as a way that can have the biggest impact on society? He talked a lot about this idea of enabling an internet of value. Why is it that we can move information completely interoperably around the world? You can access any Recode podcast anywhere in the world, but you can’t move your own money from point A to cross-border efficiently.

Right. A lot of the things had been focused on storage of bitcoin. There was a whole gang of them. Wences was one of them. Moving them, buying them, essentially buying and storing them.

Yeah. I think the earliest entrance into crypto, if you’re going to enable this, you have to be able to buy them, thus emergence of things like Coinbase and Bitstamp.

Right. But not use it? Buy it.

Yeah. So that was buying it and then you got to be able to store it. And so you have … obviously, Coinbase and in Bitstamp allow you to store it, but so do, you know, institutional players like Xapo, what Wences and team are doing. But there’s also, I think increasingly, people are focused on how do you use these technologies for real utility. Just depending upon speculation to kind of fuel the marketplace, I think is a bad idea in the long term.

Which it’s been. That’s what a lot of it’s been.

Yeah. But you’ll see...

That’s a lot of ... as blockchain is developing as a technology...

Yeah. But look, the way I think about it, you and I have both been around this ecosystem for a while. Technologies like TCP/IP and HTTP were, from my point of view, not literally but figuratively, born in the ’90s. And I think what’s happening is you have new platform technologies that are the next TCP/IPs. They are the next HTTPs.

Right.

And I think there are going to be lots of businesses built upon them. What Ripple is doing I think is compelling and that we’re very focused, kind of the anti-peanut butter, “we’re going to focus on one problem,” it’s cross-border payments.

Right. Which people had done in different ways. Right. There are tons of companies.

Yeah. I mean, there’s definitely companies, but really those have been…

It was using cash and stuff like …

We are trying to rewire, fundamentally, the infrastructure. And it’s very unusual to take on that at that base layer...

Using cryptocurrency.

Yeah. Crypto is definitely part of it. Blockchain and crypto is definitely part of the solution. And I think again, because we’ve been focused, we’ve been super fortunate, we’ve signed up a couple hundred banks, financial institutions around the world, and it’s working so far.

So talk to me about the challenges you face, because there’s a lot of controversy around your company, too.

Yeah, I think part of the controversy is born of the original crypto community is very much ...

Crazy.

Kind of “let’s circumvent the government, let’s enable anonymous transactions.” I think there’s still that ethos in part of the crypto community today. Even from the early days, Ripple took a point of view that no, no, no, we’re going to work with the system, we’re going to work with banks. And you know, if you’re in the crypto community and you’re working with the people that the other parts of the community are trying to kill, it doesn’t make you very popular.

Right.

So, Ripple has had its controversies. I think increasingly people realize that these technologies are only relevant insofar as they’re solving real problems. There’s a lot of hype in this space. There’s a lot of experiments.

And ICOs. Why didn’t it do that? Because I recall the early internet and having that kind of con man-ish kind of thing. But it wasn’t quite to the extent, the ridiculous extent that ... this extent.

I don’t know. There was some pretty crazy stuff back in the ’90s.

I guess.

I don’t know which one is better, which one’s worse. There is no doubt that I was one of the earliest people to come out and say that these ICOs are mostly scams and people should avoid them, which also made us unpopular because a lot of people loved the fact that, “I can’t raise money up and down the traditional Sand Hill Road circuit so I’m going to do an ICO.”

Right.

That doesn’t sound like ...

It takes money from people who do not have the money to afford it.

Correct. And so I actually think that the end of the ICO craze is a very healthy thing. And then the maturation of these technologies, and it’s good.

Well, except this concept behind it is great. The idea of finding other ways to raise money is a smart ...

Democratizing fundraising is interesting, as long as it’s not through preying upon those that maybe don’t have as much information and taking advantage of … which, a lot of that happened.

Right. Because the current fundraising system is sort of broken and extends only to certain people.

Yeah, there are problems with the current system, for sure. I don’t think I see it as a solution.

All right. So we’re talking to Brad Garlinghouse, who is the CEO of Ripple. We’re going to take a quick break now and we’ll be back after this, and we’re going to talk about where this is all going because I think we’re in the first stage ... would you say we’ve been through the first stage of this?

Yeah, I think we’re through stage one. It’s still early innings, but there’s a lot of ...

Why do men always say baseball metaphors?

Yeah, I don’t even like baseball, and actually I don’t have to like men, but fair enough. I don’t like using it because it’s actually a US metaphor, which isn’t a great one. You’re right, I should work on that.

All right, we’ll figure something else out. We’ll be back in a second with Brad Garlinghouse.

[ad]

We’re here with Brad Garlinghouse, he’s the CEO of Ripple. I have known him forever and so I’m giving him a little bit of a hard time, but let’s talk about your business itself. So you’ve signed up all these banks, and what you’re trying to do is essentially recreate it? How would you put it? I want to get a sense of it.

We’re trying to rewire the global financial infrastructure.

Right.

Today we depend upon technology that was built truly decades ago.

Such as wiring money or ...

Actually, this is an interesting kind of ... The etymology of that word, when you “wire money,” do you know what that comes from?

From a wire I’m guessing, right?

A telegraph. A telegraph wire, like from the 1800s. Exactly.

[telegraph noise] Western Union, is what I’m thinking.

Exactly, exactly, I mean the old version of Western Union. There’s a lot of parts of our global financial ecosystem that are stitched together with very old technologies. We live in the world of the internet. Why is it that the fastest way ... If you and I decided right now, let’s take $10,000 to London, what’s the fastest way to get it there?

In my suitcase. All in ones.

Let’s drive to SFO and buy a plane ticket and fly it there.

Yeah, yeah.

That’s a crazy thought. The fastest way in 2019, you and I can stream video from this ...

I could Venmo it? No, no, no. I couldn’t Venmo, because you have to send in pieces.

Well, you’d have to be intra-Venmo.

Yeah, yeah.

I could go Venmo to Venmo, but if I want to go ... I mean, not everybody’s on Venmo, not everybody’s on the same banking system.

It’s not hard to sign up, but yeah.

I happen to bank with First Republic bank, if I want to send money from First Republic bank to a friend of mine in Germany ...

You can’t, it’s hard.

And it’s going to cost a bunch.

You’d have to do it in chunks, too.

Yeah, it’s very broken. And there’s an opportunity to leverage modern technologies, blockchain technologies, to enable real-time settlement between financial institutions. So, we’ve been out selling these technologies.

The software.

Software, as well as leveraging digital assets for liquidity. So, the idea being that ... The way that global financial ecosystem works with those cross-border transactions is the bank of Kara, you can be US dollar. I’ll be the bank of Brad, and I’m the Philippine peso. You would pre-fund pesos in my account and I would pre-fund dollars in your account, and those are called, these banking relationships, “correspondent banking.”

Then we use those, we daisy-chain them through a system so that we can hop, hop, hop, and I don’t have to have a relationship with everybody, because you have a relationship with people, etc. Every hop adds time, it adds cost, it adds the risk of errors. There’s an error rate in the global financial wiring system, about 6 percent.

Hm, that’s a lot.

Imagine if 6 percent of your Google searches resulted in an error. I think it’s only a matter of time before these things change. We can debate whether or not Ripple will be successful, but there’s no doubt in my mind that over the next 10, 15, 20 years, this will change. And it does get back to what Chris Larsen has talked about from the very beginning. In internet of value ... Enabling value to move the way information moves today, I think will unequivocally happen.

What are the challenges from your perspective right now? After doing this ... Because again, the first part of this was all about weird parties in Puerto Rico and all kinds of stuff like that, a lot of that were these stories, or stupid events here or weird people and ... I meant in speculation around the price of bitcoin.

Here’s an interesting kind of observation about how the industry has matured. You started with Silk Road, and when you talked about crypto, it was about drugs and ...

Drugs and prostitution, terrorism.

Bad stuff. And then we went from Silk Road to speculation. That’s actually forward progress.

With a stop at terrorism.

Yeah. I mean, the industry needs to continue to mature.

So then you went to bitcoin. Go ahead, speculation.

You went from illicit activity to speculation, and today you’re going from speculation to utility. I don’t think we’re fully at utility yet because there was very few companies, in fact I think Ripple is really the only company that has production use cases of blockchain and crypto at scale.

So where’s speculation now? I can’t remember the last time I looked at bitcoin’s price.

Bitcoin’s at $5,200 so it ...

It went up and down, wasn’t it 20 or something?

Yeah, I think it hit a high of around $19,000, $20,000, and it came back down. It has been called ... we’re in the middle of a “crypto winter,” or I think some people think we’re now entering the “crypto spring.” I don’t think about those descriptions so much. We look at this over about three weeks, or three months or three years. I mean, if this is a long journey ...

But why the speculation? Explain to ... I have some sense of it, explain to regular people what’s going on there.

Well, it’s kind of the speculation of the dot-com era. Frankly, I think people ... The pursuit of get-rich-quick schemes gets people excited, they dive in. I think with people, the speculation bubble was aggressive about 18 months ago. I think as time has passed, people are increasingly focused on, “Are these technologies solving a real problem?” I think there will continue to be a weeding out ... I think it’s actually a healthy thing for the market. I’ve been public in saying, if there’s roughly 2,000 different crypto tokens out there, I’ve said that 99 percent of them, I think, will go to zero.

To zero. Which ones remain? And why do you need them? Again, explain for regular people.

Well, why do you need them? It depends on what use case. Some people have taken the point that there’s going to be one set of crypto to rule them all.

A global cryptocurrency.

Yeah, I don’t really subscribe to that. I think the different use cases for different ...

Subject.

Well, what Ripple’s doing around cross-border transactions. We use a technology in our tech stack called the XRP ledger. XRP is the third-most valuable cryptocurrency, its market cap ... It trades at about, I don’t know, 30-32 cents. I don’t know where it is right now. It’s part of how we manage liquidity for these financial institutions. It allows you, instead of that pre-funding I was describing earlier, where the Bank of Kara put Philippine pesos in the Bank of Brad, you now can shoot off payments in real time instead of pre-funding between the dollar and the peso by using XRP as a bridge currency, in effect.

Right, bridge currency. So it’s not really a currency? Well, currency’s just an agreement between people that this is worth something, right?

Yeah, it’s interesting. The word “currency” has different definitions to different people. I think about currency as something that is fiat currency. Meaning, you can go use it at Starbucks. It makes no sense, in my opinion, in the United States, to go use bitcoin or XRP at Starbucks. The dollar works, or decently works. Now, that isn’t necessarily true in some other markets and countries where holding fiat currency actually …

It’s dangerous.

It just has a lot of inflation, and there’s some currencies that are weak.

Yes, that’s when this started, right?

That’s exactly right. So I’m not saying ...

But isn’t the dollar bitcoin, then? Isn’t the dollar just that now? Hasn’t it become that?

How do you mean?

Isn’t the dollar the currency?

Globally?

Shouldn’t there just be one?

No. I don’t think that from a sovereignty of nations point of view, right, you have the yen, you have the euro, you have the RMB, you have the rupee, you have the dollar.

But I mean what it’s leading to, that there’ll be one ...

Oh, I don’t think so.

One cryptocurrency to rule them all.

Look, I mean, you’ve seen what’s happened in the eurozone by bringing on some countries whose fiscal behavior has caused problems to the rest of the eurozone because they standardized around the euro. Unless you’re going to have regulatory frameworks ... I’m thinking of Greece in particular, is one that the odds are is problematic, where I think the eurozone probably wishes Greece had not come in to use the euro and that became complicated. I don’t subscribe to the idea that there’s going to be one currency to rule them all, whether it’s fiat or digital.

So, there won’t be one cryptocurrency, there’ll just be one that people use a lot, for example.

I just think there’ll be different use cases for different things. I actually own bitcoin, so I’m “long bitcoin.” But you know, bitcoin is not going to be used to solve a payments problem. Bitcoin as a technology is slow in terms of transaction speed, and it’s expensive on a per-transaction basis. Worst of all, probably, its power consumption, I mean, I’m sure you’ve read about these things, but it’s a little bit shocking that the percentage of global power ... bitcoin alone represents almost 1 percent of global power consumption.

I can’t believe you’re surprised people are greedy as fuck. But that’s just me. I mean, what are you talking about, of course it’s using it. Why not? They could dredge...

But there’s other ways to use ...

If they could dredge the Bay here and knock over the Golden Gate Bridge for money, they’d do it. You know they would.

I think that there’s ...

Thank-you, that is my TED Talk for today.

There’s other ways. I mean, you could use these technologies for great benefit. One of the things that I find most compelling about what Ripple is doing is there is a massive population that is either unbanked, under-banked, or those that are the most penalized by the current system. Think about it: The population that is paying the cross-border remittance costs, that’s the population that can least afford it. I was at a talk by the chief economist of the World Bank, and he said their goal was by 2030 to reduce the average remittance cost from 600 basis points, or 6 percent, to 300 basis points, by 2030.

Which is not, still ...

I happened to be speaking right after him at this event and I kind of started my talk, respectfully, by saying ...

It should be zero.

Well, not zero, but let’s talk about, how do we get to 30 basis points? That’s achievable. There’s so many things that if we reduce the friction measured by cost and speed that we can unlock in terms of what’s possible...

So everybody could be banks. This term “unbanked” has been a big one I’ve heard a lot of places I go, the unbanked, and it’s most people who are moving around money or whatever.

Some people say, they blame the banks for the unbanked, but banks are profit-motivated entities. If they can profitably serve a segment of the population, they will do so. The challenge is, if you’re a migrant worker, you know, between countries, and you want to carry your currency, you have to either deal with the marauders who might try to steal it, or if you’re moving it through some kind of banking establishment, they’re going to take a lot of that value because you’re transferring it kind of back and forth.

We don’t think about that when we walk to Starbucks in downtown San Francisco, but there are billions of people who have not been brought in to the financial ecosystem, and I think any time in history you have reduced the cost and increased the efficiency of a technology ...

You bring more people into it. Like phones.

Correct. I mean, text messaging. Well, phones, and text messaging even more so. You and I both remember when sending one text message might have cost 25, 50 cents. And now as that cost came down to effectively zero ...

Well, the phone itself, I think is really even more so. The concept of everybody having a cell.

Yeah, everybody — I even think, though, in the late ’90s everybody had a ... A lot of people had mobile phones, but sending one text message costs like 25 cents. So you were very thoughtful about how many texts you sent. Nowadays, it’s like, I don’t even think about it.

I don’t think about it at all. I don’t think about any of it.

You don’t even think about as having a cost to send a text.

Do you ever think about international costs?

Oh yeah.

I’m not going to say which Google executive because he’s under scrutiny right now, but one was complaining about when they first got the iPhone and the international pricing.

I don’t remember.

Nothing worse than a billionaire complaining about the cost of something. I was like, “I don’t care, I’m so glad you got cheated.” In any case, let’s get to the problems that you foresee right now. What are some of the big issues that you imagine being a problem?

I think one of the challenges that is often talked about in this space is regulatory comfort and uncertainty. I spend probably 20-25 percent of my time flying around the world, meeting with regulators globally. More often than not, that’s simply education. People hear the word “crypto” and they go to that Silk Road place.

I quickly explain to them, Ripple-enabled technologies — well, Ripple-enabled transactions — all of them are KYC, meaning know your customer. All of them are checked for AML, anti-money laundering, all of them are checked for OFAC compliance ... Name your acronym for financial regulation and we ... What Ripple’s doing is not circumventing any regulatory frameworks. Once regulators understand, they’re like, “Oh, okay.”

The challenge is that when you hear “crypto,” they don’t necessarily assume that. And so, there’s a journey. You know frankly, the reason why I’m in a tie today, which I’m not sure of the last time you saw me in a tie.

Never. It’s a lovely suit. I’m wearing my SoulCycle outfit, but go ahead.

Spending time talking to regulators and making sure they understand ...

Which regulators are you talking to today?

The Milken Institute is having their event down in Los Angeles.

Oh, you’re going down to Los Angeles?

I’m coming back. I just got back.

Okay, who were you on the stage with discussing ... Oh, there were a lot of regulators hanging in that place.

A lot of people.

That’s like dripping with regulators, global ...

Just dripping.

I can’t go there anymore, I’ll be honest with you. They invited me, and I was like, “No, I’m busy.” I made something up.

You’re busy with me!

I am, but I made something up. I was like, I can’t, international world of blabbers. Oh, now I’ll never be invited again. Oh well. Which was my goal right then. So, reassuring them that it will not be used for illicit purposes, why?

I think any new technology can be used for illicit purposes.

Hence the internet pornography, child … pedophilia. Remember the Communications Decency Act, when that was passed?

These were important steps. We’ll go through the same important steps in making sure that these new technologies are used constructively in a way that helps society.

All right, so regulation’s one, current banking systems. The bank companies who have been somewhat resistant.

We have had an unbelievably positive reception. I mean, 2018, which people called the crypto winter, was a phenomenal year for us as a company. Q1, we hit all of our goals for the quarter, things are going extremely well. It’s because we are solving a real problem. So, do we have a long way to go in the journey we’re on, of really enabling an internet of value? 100 percent.

All right. So what are the problems from the banks that you see? Because if you did this correctly, it’s like going to the media companies back in the internet days like, “We’re not going to hurt you.” That’s really what you’re doing.

That’s a good point but ... It belies how the banking system works at that level. There’s a small number of oligopoly, of what we call money-center banks. They are the global banks that make money. So Citibank made about $8 billion last year from other banks. Because if you bank with a regional bank — if I may ask where you bank?

Wells Fargo.

So Wells Fargo’s not considered a tier one money-center bank. They certainly work with a city to reach certain court orders, and depending where you’re sending money, the city is taxing Wells. Wells doesn’t love the idea that they’re paying the city. So it turns out, 99 percent of banks love what we’re doing, because we’re democratizing something that’s controlled by a small number of banks, their competitors.

To make the markets, right? To get between markets.

Because they have the most equity they’ve pre-funded around the world. Citi, Deutsche Bank, JPM, these are the big kind of money-center banks that other banks use.

So how much resistance do those big banks put up to you?

Well, I have publicly said that Citibank was going to be our last customer.

Why’s that?

Because they’re the biggest of the big. They make more money ...

What’s the benefit for them doing this? There isn’t.

You and I have been in Silicon Valley a long time, it’s a classic innovator’s dilemma. Do you lean into ... These technologies are going to happen, how long do you wait to adopt them? And how much market share do you lose by waiting? I think some big money-center-type banks are actually leaning in to these technologies because they see this is the future and they want to make sure that they are on board. If they can go to Citi’s customers and say, “Hey, I can enable these global transactions for you and reduce the cost significantly.”

So what, then, is the role of the bank, from your perspective?

I don’t think ... You know, and again, there’s some in the crypto community who’d argue with this point, but I don’t think banks ... I don’t think governments go away. And if governments don’t go away, banks aren’t going to go away. Banks are applying a very important regulatory framework that I actually think is important for society.

I personally believe that banks will continue to serve that role, they’re good at it. Sure, maybe they could be better at it and we could point to lots of ways that they have, maybe could have been better. But there’s lots of ways banks will continue to be part of the solution in this. I think this is a new set of technologies that they can benefit from to grow their business.

I want to talk more about where this is going. So when you think of yourself, before you finish, as the crypto group, you’re all not together. People do tend to lump everyone in.

Yeah, you make a really important point. It’s important to me that people understand this is not one big group. Even in Washington, there’s various lobbying organizations coming together and a lot of them, we won’t join because they have, as their members, some people who espouse the criticality of anonymous transactions. That is not going to fly here.

Not with regulators.

Well, it turns out regulators globally. It’s not just in the United States. That is not going to fly, and so I want to ...

We do have the Cayman Islands, don’t we? And Swiss banks, and so they exist.

I mean, not anymore! Swiss banks in the last 20 years have changed dramatically. I just think ...

They have pierced the veil.

We want to change the system by working with the system, and I think trying to hold onto ideas that are counter to fundamental tenets of the current system is just going to slow adoption down. These are profound technologies that can really benefit society in lots of ways. We can reduce the friction of global commerce, we can allow people globally more access to the economies around the world to compete. I think that’s actually a really good thing.

Okay, we’re here with Brad Garlinghouse, he is actually one of my favorite people in Silicon Valley, don’t tell him. He’s sitting right here, he’s very funny. He’s always very affable when I insult him and his friends.

I allow you to insult me and I smile.

You do, you smile. I know what you’re thinking. What are you thinking, actually? Are you thinking, “That jackass?”

No, I actually ... You and I met in the late ’90s.

Yeah, we did.

And I think you’ve always been an important voice.

Trying to keep you honest. Thank you, I’m trying to keep you honest. As long as you respond, I really appreciate it. But let’s talk about where banking is going, and not just banking, but currency. Regulatory issues are an issue, big banks, power of big banks, the lobbying power. Things take a while to break apart, although everyone thought media companies had hung the moon forever and now they’re in a much more prone position to companies like Facebook and others.

And Vox.

Vox, yeah, right. Yeah, and us over here, “Hey, it’s us.” So, we’re irritatingly small but that’s how I like it.

Where are the power centers? Where does bank — like, Amazon? I always think they should be doing this, this is kind of something ...

Well, I think it’s an interesting question and that you are seeing ...

Just the one company, I think that Facebook, everyone’s always on Facebook, but I’m like, no, Facebook, it’s Amazon.

Apple has announced some things recently, Apple Pay. Amazon has made some noises and partnered with Chase and some things. I think you would continue to see digital-first companies lean into this space and to extend it because it can be done better. Then I think you’re going to see companies like Amazon, say, I have a ton of respect for Amazon. And I think if Amazon were to offer solutions around payments, do you think it would take four days to send a payment to London?

No.

It costs... Actually, a gentleman who used to work at Ripple sent me an email this week. He had invested in a company in Europe and he had a 4 percent fee, it was an investment. So it wasn’t a small check, a 4 percent fee by the time that it was all settled.

Right, to get the money there?

Yeah, like that is crazy. And I just think that if Amazon were to aggressively enter this market ... And you asked the question earlier, what is the incentive for the biggest of the big, the cities to lean in? Well, if they don’t and Amazon launches ...

Or Apple.

Or fill in the blank.

Right.

Where does that leave them?

Right? Who do you think is most likely the current ...? Or will it just be new companies that will be doing this, new banks? What would you call them?

I mean, you have digital-first banks, right? Mobile-only banks. I don’t have the list in front of me. You were seeing lots of activity in this space. The slower the incumbents are to evolve, the more you’re going to see competition enter.

Yeah, but digital-first banks I still have to operate in the current banking system.

For sure.

They still can’t do these settlements without fees.

Yeah, that’s true. But I thought you were going to go, they still have to enforce regulatory frameworks and very globally. But yeah, in various countries around the world, you’re seeing more and more entrepreneurial efforts around launching new kinds of financial institutions, payments. Here locally, SoFi, lots of people are going into this space, and maybe that’s because some financial institutions have been relatively slow to evolve.

Yeah.

That’s what feeds Silicon Valley.

Talk to me about the trends. So you all would be writing systems really to do this?

Yeah. I grew up in Kansas, and then when my mom asked what we would do it’s like very simplistically, like, “I sell software to banks.”

Right. Why not become the bank?

Well, that is an interesting question. Many people have thought Ripple could do that. So think about what that means. That means every customer we have, we have to go through the KYC, know your customer process, and you have to enforce all of those regulatory frameworks. If I were to go into that directly, I think our success in fundamentally changing the way this works, rewiring it more quickly, would go much more slowly.

So the benefit to that Filipino worker would take longer to reach, as opposed to saying, “No, no, no, let’s take, let’s go.” The banks already have the customers. I mean, I’ve been fond of saying if you want to enable an internet of value, you have to connect the repositories of value.

Right.

The repositories of value are the banks.

Right. And the customers they have.

If you went to kind of create a whole new system and compete with the banks and get the money on your account ...

It means shifting people off the things they normally do. Well, that’s happened again and again in every internet space. Everyone had a phone in their house. Everybody. I just found a story the other day, I wrote a column about it at the Times, where I had a landline phone. Who the hell has a landline phone? I mean, some people do, but really, what I mean, like, it’s shifted quickly. It shifted quickly on public phones. It does shift quicker than you think. People do change their behaviors.

Yeah, banking has been slower in that regard. But I think the banks continue to provide a very important role. And you may call me a bank apologist. I just think that ...

That’s the crypto people talking. They called me before this.

I just think that in the global … in the scale of global financial infrastructure, banks and big payment providers, that’s where it’s at. And I’ll give you an example. A big oil company wanted to meet with us because they have truck drivers in Nigeria who don’t have bank accounts and they need to pay them. They have M-Pesa accounts. Well, you can’t ... yeah, this is a big oil company and they bank at some of the biggest banks, but those banks can’t settle a transaction to M-Pesa.

Right.

Or to PayPal or to Alipay or to ... We fundamentally look at the world and say, how do we stitch this together in an interoperable way? So that sending a payment from Citi to M-Pesa or somebody else, like that’s no problem.

Just happens. And how do you look at those payment providers like in M-Pesa or Venmo or PayPal or the others?

I think they’re all part of the fabric that needs to be interoperable.

Right, so that it would go, the payments would go right there?

Yeah, I mean, look, I was onstage with Dan Schulman, who I respect immensely, recently.

PayPal CEO.

PayPal CEO, and there’s an interesting irony, PayPal owns Venmo.

They do.

If you look at the FAQ on PayPal for how to move money from PayPal or Venmo, you have to move the money from Venmo to your bank and then back to PayPal.

Yeah, it’s crazy.

It’s totally crazy!

I was just paying someone a larger amount the other day and I was like, I cannot believe this. I couldn’t do, I had “reached my limit for this month” and I was like, why? And I wrote why, like why is that my limit for this month if I have the money, like what’s that ...

You’re a sketchy operator.

I know I am. I run a serious … I don’t know, what would I run? What kind of sketchy things?

I don’t even want to, I’m not going to play that game.

A shadowboxing operation.

My point is that there’s so many ...

I’m a well-known drug dealer. It’s going to be come out. It’s going to be amazing.

There’s so many examples where this friction exists ... And I think that the fastest way for Ripple to impact that isn’t to try to go get people to onboard ...

So, you’re software company for banks.

Financial institutions.

So what then happens to that bitcoin and the rest of them? It just continues?

Well, the rest of them is a lot and that’s what I think a lot of them, they have no use case and I think they will ...

But where is the actual, I want to finish up talking about where’s the actual use cases for consumers. How long does it take to get to them?

So, I think that question goes back to what we were talking about earlier, and you know we referenced Wences Casares, a very talented guy from Argentina. I think the consumer use case in Argentina I can get my head around.

Meaning?

Meaning that you have a currency there that you may not want to hold because it’s very inflationary. You have a very high credit card fee cost where it’s, you 600-700 basis points for a small — and that is expensive.

In that context, you could see crypto actually starting to infiltrate traditional transactions. I think in the United States, the dollar works. Your Visa is not that expensive. And I think it’s not in my lifetime I think we’re going to see any erosion of the dollar.

Yeah, that’s it. It doesn’t shift. It’s like oil, it’s like oil’s still cheapest compared to everything else.

No. Do I think bitcoin, I mean, I don’t think about bitcoin as a currency. Back to my scalability.

Yeah.

Bitcoin, could it be digital gold where it’s a store of value? And if you want to, people buy gold today for a host of reasons.

And they don’t actually own gold. They do, but they don’t.

Some people do. I mean, it depends, but ...

You and I watch Billions, we know we have a safe full of gold. Did you see that one thing?

I love that show, actually.

I love that show. I love the lifting of the bouillion …

My point being that the use case for bitcoin, maybe it’s a store of value that, if allows people want to … It’s the next, it’s digital gold or digital diamonds, and I don’t know if people really hold diamonds as a store of value, but maybe.

They do, what are you talking about? I think they hold on to everything.

Loose diamonds? I don’t care.

Diamonds, art, lots of things.

Right, art for sure.

That’s what Elizabeth Warren wants to tax, my friend. In case you’re interested in the art, the wine, the ... all the other things you rich people have. Do you have a lot of wine now that you’re really, really ...

I don’t really drink as much as I used to.

Yeah. Interesting. What do you hold? You hold bitcoin. You hold ...?

I hold bitcoin, I hold XRP, which is a part of Ripple’s technology stack. That’s basically it.

Do you hold cash anymore, like dollars?

I mean, my friends kind of make fun of it. I still use cash.

Yeah.

I think, you’re going to tip people.

Okay, not tip people, but when you think of value, you on stock. How should people think of wealth anymore?

Well, I do subscribe to the idea of just coming from my portfolio allocation. When friends of mine ask me, “Hey, should I invest in crypto?” the story I often tell them, which you’ll appreciate ... in 1999 it was not obvious that Google is going to win.

Right.

Had you bought a basket of the 10 search engines, which included Lycos and Infoseek and I can’t remember, WebCrawler, AltaVista.

That guy, Infoseek. Remember him? He had a house that was totally wired before everybody else. Like you pushed a button, like one of those digital lighting things, everything. Everything in the house was like ...

If you bought the 10 search engines, you got Google.

Right.

And if you hit it, you kind of equally, that one worked out great.

Yeah.

Your IRR on that investment would work out really well.

Yeah.

I have told my friends, I think about what’s going on in crypto somewhat similarly. I can’t say with certainty how this is going to play out. There is no doubt in my mind that digital assets are here to stay. Digital assets are going to be solving real problems and how the global transactions occur and having exposure, I wouldn’t go all-in on any of them.

Now, I happen to unobjectively say, I think what we’re doing in the XRP ecosystem, what I see other companies doing in the XRP ecosystem is very interesting. But that’s also like saying, why didn’t Lycos win? Why did Google ... it’s early in the ...

Yeah, I can tell you, but there has to be ... So the companies in this thing, if people are thinking about it, is the actual currencies like bitcoin and the holding companies to store and buy them. Then the software to make it work. And what else?

That’s pretty much it. I think about it as, you have the application layer, the software to make it work. You have an application layer, Ripple is an application layer around correspondent banking. You have, I think as an example, a compelling company called BitPay. I think it’s the leading consumer payments ... So you can use your bitcoin to buy things on the internet and it’s part of the checkout process.

Still small.

It’s still small, but everybody’s take, you’d be surprised, BitPay is doing incredibly well.

Okay.

And so, they’re an application layer on top of that infrastructure ...

So you want to buy like, whatever, lunch. You can’t buy lunch still, but go ahead.

Well, I can’t name off the top of my head, but people are integrating BitPay the same way they integrated PayPal.

Right. Got it. Okay. You’re right, you’re right, fair point.

At checkout. You’d have to ask the CEO of BitPay, and he’s a smart guy …

But you’d have to have bitcoin to do it, right?

They support a couple of different, I can’t remember exactly what they support, but yes, you’d have to own a digital asset in order to facilitate those transactions. But my point being, that’s the application layer.

Right.

You have the storage layer we already talked about and the exchanges, there’s hundreds of exchanges around the world now. Some of them are doing really, really, really well. Some of them have gotten into trouble because they haven’t been as regulatory on point.

Government will come down on that stuff.

But it continues to, I think, in general a macro ...

The company ignores everything in Facebook does. But bitcoin, “we’re on it!”

They’re on it now.

Yeah they are, what, Face[book]? I know that, I know. Let me finish with that. What do you think about all that and having worked for all these companies?

Maybe, if I may just keep it at a macro level, I think we all in Silicon Valley and frankly more broadly, I think we have a responsibility to be good citizens. And I think that manifests itself in lots of ways. And I think there are examples I can point to where I think some of the companies that you and I have known, and it’s like, would I have done it that way? Maybe not.

Right. How does that change? Do you think it’s going to change now? Regulation obviously is one way.

Yeah. And I mean, look, for better or for worse, which smart people can debate, I think that some of the largest players have invited that regulatory scrutiny. And there will be regulation, I expect, coming out of that. And I don’t know if that’s good or bad.

I think it’s because, for example, your stuff is going to sort it out better because you’ve been in, you’re in a regulatory environment to start with. Cars are a regulatory environment, all that’s going to be a lot faster and more innovative because it’s already within a regulatory framework. That might have to change, obviously, but people are used to it. Health care. That’s why they are so much slower too, in a weird way. And the stuff that has had that the problems are without any regulations.

Yeah, well it’s also, these are new problems, right?

Really? Hate is not a new problem.

No, I’m talking about data privacy.

Right.

Twenty years ago, your life didn’t exist on servers on the internet.

They were papers. You’re right. Yes, I get that.

And now they do. And these are new problems. And I’m not commenting on the, yes, hate is a problem. Look, I personally am not a big social media user and there’s a lot of reasons for that, but I do think those platforms have more of an obligation than they embrace to correct these things. I actually did tweet something out, which again, I don’t do a lot of, but I have people impersonating me on these various platforms.

Really? Why?

I shouldn’t have drawn your attention to that.

Why?

I submitted to Instagram, like “this person’s impersonating me,” and I got a feedback back. They’re like, no, it’s you.

Oh, no.

I was flabbergasted that ...

Want me to call them?

No, it’s been fixed. But I acknowledge they have a hard problem, but if you created the problem, you’ve got to own the problem.

Yeah, that’s what I say to them, all the time. You made it. Like, I love every time one of them, it’s always marked like, “We need to work on this together,” and I’m like, “I’m not working on this. I got things to do. I got to go get the cat vaccinated. You can handle this. You started it.” You know what I mean? “I’ll take care of my stuff.” But anyway, it’s just an interesting problem.

Do you have any advice, last thing, for people who really want to get into this as an industry, for entrepreneurs? What’s the thing you’d caution against?

I was a little bit cautious but I would lean into that. I think, as we talked about the very beginning of these conversations, there’s macro trends happening and I think blockchain is a macro trend that I think is not going away. It’s going to impact lots of parts of lots of industries in the same way the internet impacted lots of industries. And so becoming expert in this space is a really good thing. There’s going to be more and more companies launched, addressing different use cases.

My only council, I guess, in terms of cautionary notes, is focus on the substance, not the hype. As it happens on the internet, people added .com in this, you had people adding blockchain this. And it’s just like, are you solving a real problem? Or you just use catnip for an investor?

That’s right.

Saying like, a crypto company or a blockchain company.

Right.

No, these technologies are profound. I think it will impact many things, but focus on one thing. Don’t try to peanut butter.

No peanut butter. That is a very wise thing to say. You’re right. People do do that, catnip.

Catnip for investors.

I like that a lot. Do you know I had bitcoin? Do you know that?

You don’t anymore?

I lost the thing. Had it on a little drive. I had 10 bitcoin.

That’s worth a lot of money now.

I know! It wasn’t worth that — when it got up to 20, I thought, gosh, I’m such an idiot. I had 10 bitcoins, I will do a story on it, Wences ... it’s like a 100 years ago.

Yeah, it was cheap then.

Yeah, whatever. I know it was. Thank you very much, Kara Swisher threw away, like probably threw it out in the garbage with my peanut butter sandwiches and things like that. Anyway, I’m not going to be doing any cryptocurrency investing, as I do not do any technology investing.

Bitcoin rallied about 101.55% between April 2 and May 14. This sharp rally after a long bear phase surprised many, including us. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase have said that, after the rally, Bitcoin is trading above its intrinsic value. They find some similarities in the current rally to the one in late 2017.

However, we believe that a rally of such a magnitude was necessary to change the sentiment from sell on rallies to buy on dips. Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee tweeted that the bear market is over. In a recent conference, he cited 13 reasons that indicate the end of the bear phase.

The recent upsurge in prices has attracted investors back into cryptocurrencies. The trading volumes at the centralized exchanges skyrocketed in April. Notwithstanding, we do not expect a vertical rally from current levels. It is likely to be a gradual up-move. We may witness one more round of selling that will shake out the weaker hands before starting a sustained uptrend.‏

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) held the 20-day EMA and rebounded sharply on May 19. However, the bears are mounting a strong defense at the overhead resistance of $8,496.53. If the bulls fail to scale this level, the digital currency might remain range bound between the 20-day EMA and $8,496.53.

A breakdown of the 20-day EMA can drag the price down to the next critical support of $5,900. We expect this level to hold.

On the contrary, if the bulls scale above $8,496.53, the BTC/USD pair can rally to the next target of $10,000. The trend is bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. However, we do not find any reliable buy setups yet, hence, we are not suggesting a trade in it.

ETH/USD

The drop in Ethereum (ETH) took support at $225.39. This is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The digital currency will now try to move up to the $300–$322 resistance zone.

On the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair plummets below $225.39, it will lose momentum. The trend will weaken if the 20-day EMA breaks down. Therefore, if the traders hold some long positions, they can raise the stop loss to $210. They can keep trailing the stops just below the 20-day EMA. Others, who have already closed the long positions can wait for a new buy setup to form before entering again.

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) triggered our buy levels recommended in the previous analysis. Though the digital currency bounced on May 19, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. It has again dipped towards the 20-day EMA, which is an important support to watch out for.

If the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the moving averages, a drop to $0.27795 is probable. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $0.2750.

Conversely, if the pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and scales above $0.45, it is likely to pick up momentum and move up to $0.60. Though there are minor resistances at $0.50 and $0.55, we expect them to be crossed.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded from the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The trend remains bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 50. On the upside it is facing selling at the resistance line of the channel. If the bulls fail to break out of the channel, the digital currency might still move up gradually as long as it stays above the 20-day EMA.

The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. After that, a drop to the support line of the channel is probable. A breakdown of the channel will change the trend in favor of the bears. On the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the channel, it can pick up momentum and rally to $600.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) bounced from the first support and scaled above $91 on May 19, but it is struggling to stay above this level. It is again back below $91 and might retest the support at $84.3439. The 20-day EMA is also just above this support. Hence, this is an important level to watch out for.

If the LTC/USD pair slides below $84.3439, it can fall to $74.6054. If this support also gives way, the pair can drop to $66.47.

On the other hand, if the bulls propel the digital currency above $91 and sustain it, a rally towards its target objective of $158.91 is probable. Hence, the traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $70.

EOS/USD

EOS found support just above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests the bulls have the upper hand. However, they are currently finding it difficult to push the price above $6.8299.

A failure to scale above $6.8299 will result in a consolidation for a few days. The EOS/USD pair will weaken on a breakdown of the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to the bottom of the large range at $4.4930–$6.8299 is probable. The trend will turn negative if the pair dips below the $4.4930–$3.8723 support zone.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) made another new intraday high on May 19 but failed to break out of the resistance line. This is the fourth time the digital currency has turned down from this resistance.

The BNB/USD pair might now correct to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. A break below the 20-day EMA will weaken the momentum and if the pair slides below the 50-day SMA, it will signal a deeper correction.

The trend remains up as both the moving averages are sloping higher and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. If the bulls break out of the resistance line, it is likely to pick up momentum.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has been consolidating near the overhead resistance of $0.14861760 for the past six days. The dips have been bought by the bulls, which shows demand at lower levels. If the digital currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760, it can rally to $0.22466773. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

Traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760 and keep a stop loss of $0.1150. Contrary to our assumption, if the XLM/USD pair fails to climb above the overhead resistance, it might remain range-bound between $0.1150 and $0.14861760 for a few days. The pair will weaken if it breaks below the moving averages.

ADA/USD

The bulls are finding it difficult to propel Cardano (ADA) above the overhead resistance of $0.094256. Now, the bears will attempt to sink the price below the moving averages. If successful, a drop to $0.057898 is probable. If this level also breaks down, the trend will turn negative.

However, if the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the moving averages and climbs above the overhead resistance of $0.094256, it will complete a reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275. The moving averages are sloping higher and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This shows that the bulls have a minor advantage. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions based on our previous recommendation.

TRX/USD

Though Tron (TRX) rose above $0.02815521 on May 19, the bulls could not sustain the highs. However, the positive thing is that it is clinging close to the top of the range. If the sentiment remains strong, we anticipate another attempt by the bulls to break out of the consolidation.

If the TRX/USD pair sustains above $0.02815521 for 3 days, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can easily carry it to $0.40 where it might face some resistance. The pair has spent a long time in the range, hence, the next leg of the up-move is likely to surprise on the upside. Above $0.40, the rally can extend to $0.50.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain above the range. In such a case, the range bound action will continue for a few more days. For now, traders can maintain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.0209. We will raise it at the first available opportunity.

The entire market of crypto investors were watching and waiting to see if today’s deadline for VanEck and Solid X’s proposal for a Bitcoin-based ETF would be rejected or approved, or delayed once again. As many expected, the deadline for the proposal has once again been extended by the SEC, further delaying a decision on if an ETF will be approved eventually.

Bitcoin ETF Delayed Once Again, Crypto Industry Yawns At Non-Event News

The potential of a Bitcoin ETF has reared its head quite a few times in recent years. The most recent Bitcoin ETF speculation took the price of Bitcoin towards $10,000 in late July as a proposal put forth by Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

The proposal was rejected, and the price of Bitcoin fell once again towards $6,000. Around that time, a proposal for a VanEck and Solid X Bitcoin ETF also reached its deadline with the SEC, but the proposal was delayed again and again. Each delay or rejection caused the price of Bitcoin to crash throughout the 2018 bear market.

Bitcoin isn't a 'unique' hedge as it's vulnerable to the same market risks as conventional investments, according to a new study.

It becomes more exposed to factors such as inflation expectations when its price is less volatile, the researcher found.

The findings are a ""cautionary note"" for investors, writes author Dimitrios Koutmos, as they suggest bitcoin isn't ""a unique asset class whose price behavior is detached from economic fundamentals.""

Watch bitcoin trade live.

An escalating US-China trade war, the slowing Chinese economy, and a prolonged Brexit process have fueled anxiety in financial markets, boosting investors' interest in bitcoin as a hedge against volatility.

However, new research suggests the cryptocurrency may have limited value as a hedge as it's vulnerable to the same factors that move the prices of stocks and other mainstream investments. While it escapes some of those drivers when its price is especially volatile, the increased risk may outweigh the greater returns.

""Bitcoin prices, despite their seemingly attractive independent behavior relative to economic variables, may still be exposed to the same types of market risks which afflict the performance of conventional financial assets,"" wrote Dimitrios Koutmos, an assistant professor of finance and technology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, in a study titled ""Market risk and bitcoin returns"" published online in the Annals of Operations Research this month.

Koutmos used treasury bill rates, the VIX and Deutsche Bank FX volatility indexes, treasury yields, forward inflation swap rates, equity indexes, and the difference between corporate bond yields and treasury yields as proxies for short-term interest rates, market-volatility expectations, and other factors that affect traditional financial assets. He examined their influence on daily bitcoin prices between January 2013 and September 2017.

His key finding was that several of these factors were ""important determinants of bitcoin returns."" Specifically, short-term interest rates and investors' expectations of stock-market and foreign-exchange volatility were significant determinants of the price of bitcoin during periods when it rose or fell sharply. Those three factors, along with general economic conditions and inflation expectations, influenced the price of bitcoin when the cryptocurrency was less volatile, according to the study.

The findings serve as a ""cautionary note"" for investors, Koutmos wrote, as they suggest bitcoin isn't ""a unique asset class whose price behavior is detached from economic fundamentals.""

They also indicate ""bitcoin's usefulness as a diversification instrument is time-dependent,"" given the cryptocurrency was more susceptible to factors such as inflation expectations during periods when its price was less volatile.

If bitcoin truly is a better hedge when its price is moving around, investors who bought into bitcoin's price surge this month as a hedge against the sharp downturn in stocks might be feeling pretty smug. However, Koutmos also found that bitcoin's superior returns during periods of high volatility weren't high enough to offset the increased risk, meaning its returns during low-volatility periods were higher on a risk-adjusted basis.

Among top fiat-to-crypto platforms, monthly volumes overall increased by a solid 85%. While itself experiencing a 47% drop in volumes, major South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb was the top exchange by total volume in April overall, reporting $17 billion.

Bithumb was followed by Upbit and Bitfinex at 8.7 billion USD (up 20%) and 6.7 billion USD (up 114%) respectively, the report continues. While Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp and Coinsbit all similarly experienced an increase in volumes in April, crypto exchange Liquid reported a decrease, according to CryptoCompare.

Among crypto-crypto platforms, the average volume increase was reportedly 57%. China-based FCoin — unlike in previous months — was the largest exchange by monthly volume at $37.1 billion (up 300%), followed by OKEx and ZB at $35.1 billion (up 12.4%) and $32.4 billion (up 18.8%) respectively.

In terms of decentralized exchanges (DEX) in April, Ethermium remained the largest DEX in the market with $194 million, despite seeing a 42% volume drop. WavesDEX saw $32.5 million (up 3.5%), followed by IDEX at $31.4 million (up 15.9%).

Decentralized platforms accounted for just 0.068% of global spot exchange volumes, trading a monthly total of $317 million USD in April, CryptoCompare notes.

Another trend identified in the report was a 124% increase in the volume of exchanges using a transaction fee mining model, having traded $115 billion in April. Nonetheless, exchanges charging taker fees still traded $352 billion (up 30%), remaining the dominant fee type at 75.1% of total volume.

As reported this January, the 2018 Cryptocurrency Exchange Annual Report from crypto and blockchain research organization TokenInsight found that DEXes account for 19% of the global exchange ecosystem, with trading volumes on DEXes amounting to less than 1% of those on centralized exchanges.

This month, crypto market cap tracker CoinMarketCap announced that it will remove exchanges from its calculations if they fail to provide mandatory data by June. The decision came on the heels of recently sparked controversies over allegedly fake or artificially volume reporting among unregulated exchanges in the industry.",

At 13:15 UTC, the price 11th largest crypto by market cap rank reached a 24-hour high of $139.31, a figure more than 120 percent higher than its UTC opening price of $62.99, according to CoinMarketCap data.

On some exchanges, however, BSV’s sudden price surge was even more drastic, increasing as much as 214 percent to reach $195 in the BSV/USDT market on the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global.

The surge is due in part to the announcement that Craig Wright has registered copyright claims on the Bitcoin Whitepaper and original code and promised to revert the copyright to the Bitcoin Association.

A release today notes:

Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.

Messari data reveals the total exchange reported 24-hour volume for BSV is $447.6 million whereas its “Real 10” volume from the 10 exchanges identified as the sole exchanges reporting honest volume figures in a report from Bitwise Asset Management reveals today’s volume figure is closer to $31.8 million.

Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, typically abbreviated as Bitcoin SV, is a fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain and was recently delisted from a number of well known exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift due to its main proponent Craig Wright, claiming that he is Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin, which many assume to be fraudulent.

Many other cryptocurrencies are flashing notable gains today, albeit not to the extent of BSV.

Bitcoin Gold (BTG), neo (NEO), tron (TRX) and bitcoin cash (BCH) are all reporting 24-hour gains above 5 percent according to data from CoinDesk.

The Chicago-headquartered exchange also elaborated that it would appoint Coinbase’s custody arm to provide custodial service for the trust’s crypto investments.

The grand opening of Elipay’s Croatian launch started with the first transaction made by Bitcoin.com’s CEO, Roger Ver, at the five-star Navis Design Hotel.

Using the Elipay System to Purchase Goods and Services With Crypto in Croatia

On Monday, Croatia got a crypto boost during a grand opening event that showcased a few Elipay merchants. The Elipay system allows for payments with crypto at both online and physical stores throughout the area. The Elipay mobile application integrates with existing Point of Sale (PoS) merchant systems and the platform was already supported by hundreds of locations in Slovenia. The first transaction in Croatia took place at the Navis Design Hotel located in the seaside town of Opatija. Bitcoin’s first angel investor and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver used bitcoin cash (BCH) to pay for his stay at the Navis Design Hotel.

“[Roger Ver] is visiting Slovenia and Croatia in the scope of the partnership between Eligma and Bitcoin.com,” the company’s blog post mentioned. Eligma continued:

Great news for all Bitcoin.com enthusiasts: At all 300+ locations accepting Elipay, you are now also able to pay with the Bitcoin.com Wallet, also in Croatia, of course.

The New Elipay System Helps Grow Crypto Adoption

The Elipay service offered by Eligma is available for Android and iOS mobile phones. Elipay supports cryptocurrencies like ETH, BCH, BTC, and the company’s native token called ELI. Out of the 300+ locations that accept cryptocurrencies, Eligma CEO Dejan Roljic told news.Bitcoin.com during the first week of April that about one third of the crypto accepting merchants are located in Bitcoin City. The notorious Slovenian crypto-metropolis is well known for being one of the most concentrated areas of cryptocurrency-accepting merchants worldwide. According to the merchant application Marco Coino, Slovenia has the most BCH merchants globally which is followed by other large concentrations like North Queensland, Australia, and Japan.

After Ver made the first crypto purchase at the Navis Design Hotel, he was also seen spending bitcoin cash at one of the largest Slovenian stores called Tuš market. Ver was again the first individual to pay with crypto at the store using the Bitcoin.com Wallet and Elipay service. The picture of Bitcoin.com’s CEO shared on Twitter shows him with a whole shopping cart full of groceries that are about to be purchased with bitcoin cash. Ver arrived in Ljubljana to visit the local BCH meetup on Tuesday in order to discuss the many benefits bitcoin cash has to offer the world.

Ver has been relentlessly pushing bitcoin cash adoption nearly everywhere he goes. Just recently he announced the Tokyo-based Alliance Cargo Direct would be adding BCH and the SLP token ACD at thousands of online and brick-and-mortar retailers. Now with the recent push in Croatia and Slovenia, BCH and other cryptos have more merchant acceptance to rely on. Eligma plans to continue adding merchant partners to the Elipay system in order to grow internationally. The startup wants to take the crypto shopping experience to a whole new level by making cryptocurrency payments user-friendly. Eligma recently started a project called Eligmalabs and partnered with the firm Spartan Solutions this past March. Additionally, the company has detailed that in the future, debit cards, credit cards, and loyalty programs will be integrated into the Elipay system.

The lower house has reportedly moved crypto-related amendments to the existing financial law to the House of Councillors at a recent plenary session.

According to Nikkei, the amendments to two of Japan’s financial laws — the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and Payment Services Act — intend to strengthen local regulations on cryptocurrency trading process. The amendments reportedly extend the regulation by adding legislation for cryptocurrency margin trading.

The new law also includes a change of crypto-related terminology, altering the term virtual currencies to “crypto assets.”

Japanese lawmakers first introduced the regulations for cryptocurrency margin trading in March 2019. The Japanese government’s executive branch, Cabinet of Japan, approved draft amendments to Japan’s financial instruments and payment services laws, limiting leverage in cryptocurrency margin trading at two to four times the initial deposit.

Margin trading represents the use of borrowed funds from a broker in order to trade a financial asset, which forms a collateral for the loan.

In April, Japan’s Minister of Finance and deputy prime minister Taro Aso urged reporters to stop using the term virtual currencies and to shift to the newly-introduced legal name crypto assets.

Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that Russia was delaying the adoption of crypto regulation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to legislate the terms cryptocurrencies and bitcoin (BTC) instead of using the sole term “digital assets.”",,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-wreak-havoc-toppling-governments-russia/,"

Bitcoin poses a hazard for the established order, weeps a senior Russian parliamentary official. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: A top official with Russia’s State Duma (the Russian Parliament) warned that bitcoin has the capacity to ruin governments because it could facilitate the offshoring of massive amounts of money.

Nikolay Arefyev, the deputy chairman of the State Duma committee on economic policy, sounded the alarm at a May 20 press conference, Rambler reported.

Official: We don’t want capital exodus from Russia

Specifically, Arefyev warned that cryptocurrencies could lead to Russia’s collapse because it could trigger a mass-withdrawal of capital to offshore accounts.

“If cryptocurrency worked, we would be completely ruined today because all financial flows would be taken out of Russia. And Russia would end. Because cryptocurrencies were created to ensure that the state does not control the flow of capital.”

Arefyev noted that since 1994, about 210 trillion rubles (or $3.25 billion) have been withdrawn from Russia. That’s equivalent to half of Russia’s annual budget.

Arefyev: Purpose of bitcoin is tax evasion

Arefyev claims bitcoin was created to hide large amounts of money in secret offshore accounts in order to enable wealthy individuals and entities to avoid paying taxes.

Therefore, Nikolay Arefyev says it’s useless to integrate bitcoin with Russia’s current financial system because it’s too speculative and shady. Instead, he suggested that a better approach would be to ban cryptocurrencies altogether.

This is something that Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman proposed for the United States.

“I look for colleagues to join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans, so that we nip this in the bud.” “An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions. It is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us.”

Vladimir Putin: Bitcoin is a magnet for criminals

The cryptocurrency industry is not regulated in Russia. As CCN.com reported in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin — a bitcoin skeptic — ordered the government to adopt crypto regulations by July 1, 2019.

The goal of the legislation is to promote the digital economy in Russia, which is struggling financially amid crippling U.S. economic sanctions. However, those rules have been delayed. This is the second such postponement in two years.

Like the Duma’s Nikolay Arefyev, Putin has expressed skepticism about bitcoin amid concerns over money-laundering and tax evasion.

In 2017, Putin warned Russians about the risks posed by virtual currencies. Specifically, he said bitcoin attracts criminals (video below).

“[The risks include] opportunities to launder funds acquired through criminal activities, tax evasion, even terrorism financing, as well as the spread of fraud schemes.”

Russia’s central bank echoed Putin’s anti-crypto sentiments, and called bitcoin a pyramid scheme.

Duma official: Russia won’t use crypto for 30 years

In January 2019, a Duma official said cryptocurrencies will probably not be implemented in Russia for at least the next 30 years.

Elina Sidorenko is the chairwoman of an interdepartmental working group of the State Duma for managing risks of cryptocurrency turnover. She made the remarks in response to rumors that Russia was planning to buy $10 billion in bitcoin during the first quarter of 2019 to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions.

As CCN.com reported, Sidorenko shot down the rumors as complete rubbish. Moreover, Sidorenko said it is unlikely that crypto will be implemented in Russia for at least another three decades.

“The Russian Federation is simply not ready to combine its traditional financial system with cryptocurrencies. And to say that this idea can be implemented in Russia for at least the next 30 years is unlikely.”",2019-05-21 17:25:34+00:00,https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/laszlo-hanyecz-10000-bitcoin-2-papa-johns-pizzas,"It wasn’t until 2017 that the economy saw a major shift in emphasis on cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin. First launching in early 2009, Bitcoin was one of the first forms of electronic cash, offered up as a decentralized digital currency that worked without a centralized banking or administration system but built on peer-to-peer networks via blockchain technology. Yet, even though it took years for society, and the economy, to accept these newfound forms of currency as an important progression in the rotation of money, there was one man who might have jumped the gun a little too early on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Laszlo Hanyecz was that man – known as the “Bitcoin pizza guy” – who bought two Papa John’s pizzas for a whopping 10,000 BTC.

Back in 2010, Hanyecz bought the pizzas when the currency wasn’t even valued at a penny – yet nearly 10 years later, that same amount of Bitcoin is worth roughly $800 million USD (~$8000 USD per BTC). In a new interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, Hanyecz sat down to discuss the transaction and his history with the cryptocurrency, noting that he’d probably spent more than 100,000 BTC on pizza since then.

Within the interview Cooper can be seen grilling him over the decision, with Hanyecz stating that he doesn’t “regret it,” further sharing his own anecdote: “I think it’s great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and its an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be [like] – ‘Oh my God, you spent all that money.’” Alongside being a BTC and pizza fanatic, Hanyecz noted that he’d also offered various tech support on crypto forums, helping to fix bugs and more. All in all, it seems he isn’t too jaded over his decision, although it might not have been the best long-term investment.

A startup company plans in July to start testing futures contracts in bitcoin, and begin trading them shortly after. The products, unlike cryptocurrencies themselves, aren’t designed for the masses. Bitcoin futures are meant for financial firms that want to find new ways to profit from fintech, and launching the futures contracts is essentially a bet that there’s enough demand from the big players.

A surge in cryptocurrency prices this year may make the prospect more enticing.

The company launching the derivatives is Bakkt Trust Co. LLC., founded last year by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and other financial companies. Bakkt’s backers also include Microsoft Corp. and Starbucks Corp.

Speaking to the Fast Money program, he explained that “the halvening,” next due to take place in 2020, will see mining rewards cut in half.

With many miners now hoarding BTC, Kelly predicted that prices will rise as increased demand — tied to increasing industrial adoption and retail uses — competes with diminished supplies.

Describing the four-year cycle that leads up to “the halvening,” Kelly added:

“You generally have a rally a year into it, and a year out of it. And so we’re just at the beginning of that stage […] a supply cut is generally bullish.”

He recommended investors dedicate between 1% to 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrency while prices are stuck around the current levels of $8,000.

Earlier this month, reports suggested that investment firm Fidelity was planning to roll out BTC trading for institutional clients in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, well-known retailers and brands such as Nike have been beginning to explore how crypto could fit into their business models.

Other analysts believe there are other factors behind BTC’s recent surge. On May 20, Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert suggested the crypto’s bounce back could be linked to the ongoing United States-China trade war.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/europol-shuts-down-200-million-crypto-mixing-service-bestmixer,"Dutch, Luxembourg authorities and Europol have shut down one of the three largest cryptocurrency tumblers, Europol reported on May 22.

A cryptocurrency tumbler, also known as a cryptocurrency mixing service, is an anonymity tool that claims to transform transactions of non-private coins to private ones by mixing crypto funds with others, which makes it difficult to track the funds’ original source.

According to the report, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) has now seized six servers of major crypto tumbler Bestmixer.io, which had a reported turnover of at least $200 million since its launch in May 2018. The service was purportedly one of the three largest mixing services for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and others.

After initiating an investigation back in June 2018, the FIOD, along with Europol and Luxembourg authorities, have banned the platform, as they found that a large number of mixed coins on Bestmixer came from criminal activity and were allegedly used for money laundering or illegal financing.

As Europol noted, Bestmixer’s closure is the first legal enforcement action of its nature against a cryptocurrency tumbler. At press time, the Bestmixer website is not operating, with a FIOD notice claiming “you are not anonymous.”

The FIOD reportedly collected data on all the transactions on the platform in the past year, including chat messages, bitcoin addresses, IP-addresses and more. The authority is planning to analyze the acquired information and share the results with other countries, Europol noted.

At press time, a number of crypto mixers can be found online, including ChipMixer, BitMix.Biz and BitBlender, among others.

Recently, Europol and German police seized the servers of a dark web marketplace, taking six figures in crypto from the arrested suspects.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-how-a-hungry-florida-man-made-cryptocurrency-history/,"Nine years ago today, the first ever Bitcoin BTC transaction for a consumer product took place after a Florida man spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas.

Since then, cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe have celebrated ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day,’ not because the man in question paid 10,000 BTC, but because at the time said transaction represented a milestone for Bitcoin adoption.

So, while buying pizza with Bitcoin today doesn’t seem too far-fetched, I can assure you it was a relatively big deal at the time because no merchant accepted the cryptocurrency as payment.

On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid a fellow Bitcoin Talk forum – the main gathering place for bitcoiners at the time – user 10,000 BTC in exchange for two Papa John’s pizzas. At the time, when Bitcoin was a little over a year old, the amount paid equated to approximately $40.

Hanyecz posted posted:

I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!

Another user, known as “jercos” accepted Hanyecz’a offer.

To complete the transaction, Hanyecz sent the Bitcoin to Jercos, who then ordered the pizza.

Hanyeczs’ pizzas have gotten more and more expensive since Bitcoin first burst on the scene. Some nine months after the pizza purchase, Bitcoin hit parity with the US dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000.

Then, on the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, the two pizzas were valued at a mouthwatering $2.4 million.

Last week, Bitcoin surpassed the $8,000 mark for the first time this year. So, if you were to make the same purchase today, you’d have to part with a salivating $80 million.

Bitcoin is still struggling to gain mainstream adoption, but with so many negative news tainting the cryptocurrency‘s reputation on an almost daily basis, I see no reason why people shouldn’t celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day.

After all, we’re talking Bitcoin and pizza. What’s not to like?",2019-05-22,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/nonprofits-turn-cryptocurrency-help-needy-venezuelans-n1008726,"BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela — Andreína Cordero started the year skipping meals so her three kids could eat. Her husband, a construction worker, was out of a job. And the family's savings had been devastated by the nation's hyperinflation, limiting Cordero's children to a diet of rice, beans, pasta and fried corn patties.

But the family got a break from their daily struggle to feed themselves this spring when a social worker enrolled them in a program run by a Silicon Valley startup that is donating cryptocurrency to hundreds of Venezuelan families.

Every week from February to April, Cordero received a deposit of EOS tokens through a cellphone app. She then traded the digital money for local currency through online transfers and used the funds to shop in market stalls.

""We finally got to eat chicken"" Cordero said. ""And there were also vegetables for the kids.""

The three-month trial in crypto transfers is now over, and the family is back to skipping meals and eating mostly beans and rice. But Cordero is thankful for the time that digital currency saved her kids from malnutrition.

""I'm very grateful for what they did for us"" Cordero said. ""It would be a blessing if something like that were set up again.""

Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies like EOS and bitcoin have become popular among investors looking to make large profits from a new and anonymous form of storing wealth.

But a handful of charities are also now using digital currencies to send relief directly to those in need, circumventing banks and companies that handle remittances. They've found the ideal testing ground in Venezuela, where the annual inflation rate by some estimates has soared to a staggering 67,000%, forcing millions to scavenge daily to feed themselves.

""Crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken"" said Joe Waltman, executive director of GiveCrypto, the charity that provided direct transfers to Cordero and more than 100 Venezuelan families in Barquisimeto. ""And there's probably no better example of broken money right now than Venezuela.""

GiveCrypto's program provided temporary help to vulnerable families by providing them with a weekly deposit worth around $7 — or about the same as Venezuela's monthly minimum wage. The organization is also aiming to make people familiar with crypto apps so they can transfer their own earnings into digital currency and use it to buy goods, long after they have stopped receiving free deposits.

""We want to show that people who are not techies or investors can also benefit from this technology,"" said Efrain Pineda, the project's manager. ""Anyone can use crypto to protect themselves from inflation and make their daily life easier.""

While many middle-class Venezuelans already try to protect their savings from hyperinflation by purchasing U.S. dollars and even gold nuggets, saving in crypto offers a solution to store wealth that may be physically safer than holding on to cash or precious metals in a crime-infested country. Online platforms that allow Venezuelans to buy and hold U.S. dollars provide a similar service.

Storing cryptocurrency presents greater financial risks than holding U.S. dollars, though, due to the wild swings in the value of some crypto assets, including bitcoin. But in Venezuela, where the local bolivar currency has lost two-thirds of its value this year, some merchants are willing to give this technology a shot.

In Barquisimeto, Leticia Luque, an informal merchant, said she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker collaborating with GiveCrypto's direct transfer scheme. She said the technology has helped her gain time to barter for better prices with suppliers and plan what she will buy next.

""We used to be in a rush to purchase goods before our bolivars lost their value"" said Luque, whose husband travels every week to Colombia to stock up on packaged foods and basic goods that the couple re-sells out of their home. ""Now we can take our time and we know that our earnings are in a safe place.""

Waltman said the Barquisimeto experiment was the first stage of a larger effort to promote the use of cryptocurrency in Venezuela, using ""stable"" currencies whose values have less fluctuation than bitcoin.

A similar initiative, known as an ""airdrop,"" is being developed by AirTM, a currency exchange platform based in Mexico City that plans to donate small amounts of cryptocurrency to 100,000 people in Venezuela this summer. So far, it has raised $300,000 from donations toward its $1 million goal.

The one-time payment of no more than $10 a person will provide only momentary relief. But the goal is also to encourage Venezuelans to engage with the AirTM platform.

""We want to show Venezuelans how to hold money outside their local currency,"" said Joshua Kliot, the organization's co-founder. ""The biggest impact this could have is to crypto-ize the country.""

And it's not just in Venezuela where nonprofits are attempting to help vulnerable people by introducing them to digital currency platforms. In Europe, Bitnation, a humanitarian agency, has enabled hundreds of refugees without bank accounts to receive direct donations through bitcoin accounts. In Jordan the World Food Program delivers aid to 100,000 Syrian refugees by creating digital currency accounts for each recipient, using blockchain technology but official currencies. To pay for goods, refugees only need to have their iris scanned in participating stores.

Paul Lamb, a nonprofit management consultant based in California, says the idea of distributing funding directly to people in need is becoming increasingly popular among humanitarian groups, because in some contexts it is cheaper than organizing the logistics required to physically hand out food or medicine. Usually these money transfers are made through debit cards in the local currency. But humanitarian groups are also starting to look at cryptocurrency.

""It's harder for someone to steal cryptocurrency,"" said Hugh Aprile, the Colombia country director for Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that has handed out debit cards to 7,000 Venezuelan refugees. ""And in situations where you have high inflation, it can ensure the stability of the funds being transferred.""

But aid programs that distribute cryptocurrency also face several challenges.

In Venezuela, power cuts, like the one that recently left much of the country in the dark for days, knock out the internet connection needed to use cryptocurrency. And connections for many are iffy even when there is power. A tightly controlled currency system that punishes financial crimes with jail time has also discouraged some merchants from accepting cryptocurrency.

""Merchants who accept crypto and are public about it risk being inspected by the government,"" said Randy Brito, the founder of Bitcoin Venezuela, a cryptocurrency education group.

Poverty is another barrier. Ariany Jaimes, a social worker who recruited participants for GiveCrypto's project in Barquisimeto, said she had to keep some of the neediest people out of the program because they didn't own smartphones with modern operating systems.

""We realize that this technology is not going to become widespread overnight,"" Jaimes said. ""But I do hope that these programs continue, because they make our life a little easier.""

Bitcoin can be viewed as an uncensorable form of money that can be sent by anyone to anywhere in the world. It can be sent much cheaper and more quickly than traditional methods, thereby improving cross-border payments and bypassing third parties. Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency capable of this feat either.

The current predicament

In an increasingly globally-connected world, sending money from one person to another, from one bank to another, and from one country to another has proved difficult. Large fees can be applied and the process can take days to clear.

There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, the movement of money can be contentious. Anti-money laundering laws are in place so that criminals are not able to hide their ill-gotten funds from governments wanting their tax money. This is undercut however through the use of tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The release of the Panama Papers showed how ineffective these anti-money laundering rules can be.

Companies such as Western Union or PayPal base their business model off the fees collected for transferring money, so it is never going to be as cheap as one would like. New companies though are beginning to make a dent in this market. This is in part due to the influence cryptocurrencies have had, as they highlight how money can be moved anywhere cheaply and quickly.

How does Bitcoin solve this problem?

Bitcoin is independent of any state or third party. Should an American wish to send Bitcoin to a country with strict sanctions such as Iran, there is relatively little that the US government could do about it. They can not control Bitcoin or how people use it.

The other important factor for Bitcoin is that the fees when compared to traditional methods are extremely cheap. This again is due to the lack of a third party. There is no profit motive behind Bitcoin – the money is used on a fair basis.

Critics of Bitcoin, particularly those in the Bitcoin Cash camp, will argue that the fees for Bitcoin have already become too high as it has failed to scale. They go on to state that Bitcoin Cash provides the benefits of cheap international money transfers thanks to its larger block scaling solution.

Story continues

What about Ripple?

XRP, or Ripple, is another cryptocurrency that can be used as a cross-border payments solution. XRP is a hotly-debated cryptocurrency, with some arguing that it isn’t a cryptocurrency at all.

The current international financial system runs on the SWIFT network and has done so since the 1970s. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is what Ripple hopes to replace with its protocol.

Ripple claims its platform is quicker and cheaper and still has all the benefits of a cryptocurrency. Whether these claims are true is a debate that will continue to run on. Ripple also claims that many banks have begun to test its technology, but despite being around for many years now, we have seen relatively few real-world use cases.

The criticism Ripple receives is largely due to the different philosophies between the Ripple and Bitcoin camps. Bitcoin aims to overthrow the current financial system and Ripple wants to incrementally improve it.

What is not in doubt is that both cryptocurrencies are both quicker and cheaper than the traditional system of cross-border payments.

Will we see new regulations?

Traditionally, financial institutions have been reluctant to change. The arrival of Bitcoin, despite plenty of discussion on forums, came out of the blue for many in the traditional finance sector. The same can also be said for governments and their regulators. Therefore, many countries have been extremely slow to adapt and regulate this new industry in a productive manner.

Although transactions through the Bitcoin blockchain have become easier to trace thanks to advances in technology, this is being combated by Bitcoin developers who hope to improve the privacy of Bitcoin through upgrades such as Schnorr Signatures.

Whether this will make money laundering easier in an ever-increasing global economy remains to be seen. However, if you are looking to send money overseas, then cryptocurrencies are now a clear alternative that many argue perform better than the traditional system.

Conclusion

Many cryptocurrencies have lofty goals of changing the world, from helping to serve the unbanked to removing the effects of fiat money from the world economy. Cross-border payments are a clear example of the benefits that cryptocurrencies can provide. As development continues, cryptocurrency should only become an easier and much better solution for sending money overseas.

An Israeli court has ruled that bitcoin is an asset, confirming the central bank’s stance. The case involves the country’s tax authority and the founder of a blockchain startup who argues that profits from the sale of cryptocurrency should be tax-free. The court has ruled in favor of the tax authority, endorsing the central bank’s definition of currency.

Latest Court Ruling on Nature of Bitcoin

An Israeli central district court reportedly ruled in favor of the country’s tax authority Monday, recognizing bitcoin as a financial asset and not a currency. Profits on its sale in Israel are therefore subject to capital gains tax.

Judge Shmuel Bornstein simultaneously rejected an appeal by the founder of a blockchain startup who argues that bitcoin should be considered a currency, so the proceeds from its sale should not be subject to taxation. Globes daily financial newspaper reported Tuesday:

The Central District Court in Lod accepted the tax authority’s interpretation, and held that bitcoin is an asset and not a currency, and that the transaction in question is therefore taxable.

Emphasizing that the status of bitcoin is still undefined in the country, the judge stated in his ruling that “it was hard to envisage a result whereby bitcoin would be considered a currency for tax purposes in particular,” the news outlet conveyed, noting that the case could reach the supreme court.

Itay Bracha, managing partner at Israeli law firm Bracha & Co. and the head of the firm’s tax department, shared his thoughts with local daily business newspaper Calcalist. He said: “The ruling is a signal to all those who have yet to report cryptocurrency-related profits or based their actions on differing legal advice … The ruling is unequivocal, and since it is not new legalization but a judicial interpretation, it applies retroactively.”

The Case

According to reports, the case involves Noam Copel, founder of blockchain startup DAV. “We’re building a decentralized infrastructure to revolutionize the transportation industry on the blockchain,” the company’s website explains.

Globes reported that Copel bought BTC in 2011 and sold them in 2013 for a profit of approximately NIS 8.27 million (~$2.29 million). Asserting that his profits should not be subject to capital gains tax, he told the court:

Bitcoin should be classified as a foreign currency, and that his profits should be seen as exchange rate differences received by an individual not in the course of a business, and therefore should not be taxed.

However, the Israel Tax Authority disagreed, proclaiming that bitcoin is not a currency under the central bank’s definition, so it cannot be a foreign currency as suggested by Copel. Instead, the agency claims that cryptocurrency falls under the definition of an asset, therefore profits on its sale are subject to capital gains tax. Monday’s court ruling obligates Copel to pay tax of about NIS 3 million, the news outlet estimated.

Central Bank’s Definition of Currency

The court accepted the tax authority’s position that the definition of “currency” should be the one defined by the country’s central bank which does not apply to crypto assets. The agency affirmed that bitcoin is not a currency from both accounting and economic aspects, stating that “its valuation is extremely volatile, any related investments carry high risk, its use is severely limited and restricted mostly to unlawful entities, and it is not used as a benchmark for value,” Calcalist wrote.

Copel, on the other hand, believes that from both aforementioned aspects, “the trust users put in bitcoin and its use as both a payment method and to benchmark value means it should be considered a currency.”

After listening to both sides of the argument, the judge rejected Copel’s appeal and ruled that he “had failed to demonstrate that bitcoin met this definition [of currency], or that it represented a real alternative to coins and notes in any country,” Globes described.

Bittax founder Gidi Bar Zakay, former Deputy Director of the Israel Tax Authority and currently director of the Israeli CPA Association, said that Monday’s ruling was based on current law, elaborating:

In my view, what will ultimately determine whether bitcoin is a currency is the reality test. As soon as its use becomes widespread, the legislature will have to rewrite the law in such a way as to accommodate this.

He added that when that happens, “we shall all benefit from these technological and monetary developments and from the ability of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to serve as efficient, trustworthy, and widely accepted means of payment.” He further opined: “the way to that lies through the regulator. If the enforcement agencies feel comfortable with the coin, and use blockchain analysis tools that make it possible to meet standards of money laundering prevention and tax avoidance prevention in a more reliable and efficient way than is the norm today, the road to it becoming a widespread means of payment will be open.”

Cryptocurrency Taxation

The Israel Tax Authority has long considered cryptocurrency an asset subject to capital gains tax. In December last year, Calcalist reported that the agency had been cracking down on the unreported crypto earnings of hundreds of Israelis, sending notices to those whose activities raised suspicion. “The authority will continue to seek out unreported [crypto] earnings,” said Eran Yaakov, the head of the Israel Tax Authority, in reply to the news outlet’s request for comment. The publication explains:

Cryptocurrencies are not defined as a currency but as a financial asset in Israel. As such, trading in cryptocurrencies is subject to a capital gains tax of 25%-30% in the country.

In July last year, the tax authority reportedly reached an agreement on obtaining information on crypto transactions with Bits of Gold, an Israeli cryptocurrency exchange with about 50,000 users. The exchange will share information about traders who have made transactions of $50,000 or more over a 12-month period. The authority has also approached other platforms for the same purpose.

While Israeli law requires financial institutions to report fraudulent transactions and suspicious activities to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority, sharing data with the tax authority is not mandatory. Tomer Niv, Chief Growth Officer at Bits of Gold, clarified that his exchange only transfers “the information we are required by law … in order to protect the privacy of customers on the one hand, and [comply with] the provisions of the law on the other.”

Central Bank’s Position and Global Standards

Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, who served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel from March 2014 to the end of February, said in January last year that the central bank had been studying cryptocurrency. However, she revealed that not much had been learned from other countries’ regulations “since no regulator anywhere in the world had issued guidelines to the banking system on how to act in relation to customers’ activity in virtual currencies,” Reuters conveyed. She was further quoted as saying:

There is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity … Beyond the risks to the customer there are also compliance risks to the bank.

In December last year, Israel became a full member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization which focuses on developing policies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The FATF currently has 36 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organizations, including the European Commission. In February the organization urged its member countries to regulate crypto exchanges like commercial banks, elaborating:

For the purposes of applying the FATF recommendations, countries should consider virtual assets as property, proceeds, funds, funds or other assets, or other corresponding value.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Analysts believe that the rally in Bitcoin might witness a short-term blip but is likely to resume its up-move and reach $9,659 by year’s end. The reason for the rise can be attributed to various positive developments in the crypto field and also to the ongoing trade war between the top two economies of the world, China and the United States. Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert believes that Bitcoin is acting like a safe haven, as it has done in the past during Brexit and Grexit.

The current recovery from the lows was backed by strong institutional flows, as indicated by the record volumes on the Bitcoin derivatives exchanges. Along with the different cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are also being sought by traders. According to crypto research firm Diar, the market capitalization of stablecoins has topped $4 billion. Even with all the controversy surrounding it, Tether continues to be the leader with trading volumes in 2019 already exceeding that of the entirety of 2018.

Early backers of EOS are likely to make huge returns on their initial investments if they sell out in the buyback offer announced by Block.one. The seed round in 2017 had valued the company at $40 million, while the buyback offer values the company at $2.3 billion.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be in an uptrend. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command. However, after a sharp rally, a minor correction or a consolidation is to be expected.

The bulls are finding it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance at $8,496.53, but on the downside, the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA. Until either level is crossed, the BTC/USD pair is likely to remain range bound for the next few days.

Contrary to our assumption, if the pair breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance, a rally to $10,000 will be in the cards. However, we do not expect this level to be crossed in a hurry.

On the downside, a break below the 20-day EMA and $6,933.90 support zone can plunge the pair to $5,900. This is an important level to watch on the downside because if it breaks, the trend will turn in favor of the bears. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) has been trading in a tight range of $220–$270 for the past five days. The trend remains bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone.

If the ETH/USD pair breaks out of $270, it can move up to $290.92. Above this level, a rally to the next resistance zone of $300–$322 is probable. The 20-day EMA will act as a strong support on the downside, below which, a dip to the 50-day SMA is likely. The bears have not been able to close (UTC time frame) below the 50-day SMA since breaking above it on February 17. Hence, a dip below this support will indicate weakness.

XRP/USD

The bulls are struggling to sustain Ripple (XRP) above $0.40. This shows profit booking at higher levels. A failure to break out of $0.45 will indicate a loss of momentum. A break below the 20-day EMA can result in a fall to $0.33108. If this support also gives way, the digital currency can slide to $0.27795.

Conversely, if the XRP/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it can rise to $0.45 and if this level is crossed, a new uptrend is likely. The level to watch on the upside is $0.60 with minor resistances at $0.50 and $0.55.

The 20-day EMA is trending up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have a minor advantage. Therefore, traders can hold their long positions with the stops at $0.2750.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from close to $450 for the third time on May 21. The zone between $450 and the resistance line of the channel is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the bulls scale this resistance zone, a rally to $600 is probable.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the BCH/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the support line of the channel. A breakdown of the channel will signal weakness. Currently, bulls have the upper hand as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone.

EOS/USD

EOS has made an inside day candlestick pattern for the past two days. This shows indecision between the bulls and the bears. If the bulls reassert their supremacy, a rally to $6.8299 is probable. A breakout of this level can push the price to $9.00.

Conversely, if the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below $5.78, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely. If this level also fails to support the pair, it can drop to the critical level of $4.4930. We expect this level to hold. If that happens, the cryptocurrency will remain stuck inside the large range of $4.4930–$6.8299 for the next few days.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has been trading close to the breakout level of $91 for the past two days. The small trading range of the past two days shows indecision. If the price bounces off $84.3439, it will again try to move up to $107. Above this level, the next target is $158.91

On the other hand, if the LTC/USD pair fails to break out of the overhead resistance, it might remain range bound for a few days. The pair will turn negative if the $84.3439–$74.6054 support zone breaks down. Therefore, the stops on the long positions can be kept at $70.

Currently, with both the moving averages trending up and the RSI above 50, the advantage is with the bulls. However, the developing negative divergence on the RSI is a red flag.

BNB/USD

Though Binance Coin (BNB) did not breakout of the resistance line on May 21, it has not given up much ground. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are firmly in the driver’s seat.

A breakout of the resistance line can propel the BNB/USD pair to $40.2919564. But if the pair reverses direction from the current levels, it can dip to the 20-day EMA, which should provide support. Below this, the next strong support is at the 50-day SMA. A breakdown of this support will signal a deeper correction.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has turned down from the overhead resistance of $0.147620. It can now fall to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer some support. If the digital currency bounces off the 20-day EMA, it will attempt to ascend the overhead resistance once again.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the XLM/USD pair below the moving averages, it can drop to $0.088542. The 50-day SMA is flat and the 20-day EMA is also flattening out. This points to a consolidation in the next few days.

The trend will turn bullish on a break out and close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760. The next target to watch on the upside is $0.22466773. We will wait for the price to sustain above $0.14861760 before recommending a trade in it.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) is trying to hold above the moving averages for the past five days. However, failure to rebound from the strong support shows a lack of demand at higher levels. If the bears break below the moving averages, the digital currency will weaken and can decline to the next support at $0.057898.

Conversely, if the ADA/USD pair bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.094256. If successful, it will complete the rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275. Hence, we retain the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) has been consistently rising above $0.02815521 for the past three days but is struggling to hold on to higher levels. The price is stuck at the breakout level. If the bulls succeed in sustaining the digital currency above $0.02815521, it can move up to the next target objective of $0.040. If this level is crossed, the next level to watch on the upside is $0.050. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $0.0209.

Contrary to our expectation, if the TRX/USD pair breaks down of the moving averages, it will lose momentum and can drop to the support at $0.02094452. In such a case, the pair might remain range bound for a few days. The 20-day EMA is marginally sloping up and the RSI is just above 50, which suggests that the bulls have a slight advantage.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-steal-100-000-worth-of-btc-from-engineering-manager-at-crypto-custodian-bitgo,"Sean Coonce, engineering manager at cryptocurrency custodian BitGo, announced that he has fallen victim to a SIM swapping hack in a Medium post published on May 20.

According to the post, Coonce had over $100,000 siphoned out of his account on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in under 24 hours.

In his post, Coone details SIM swapping, a practice that sees the attacker maliciously requesting a telecommunications carrier to redirect the traffic of a mobile phone number to a device over which they have control. This device is then used to obtain two-factor-authentication (2FA) codes which grant control over the victim’s online account.

After describing in detail how the attack had been carried out, Coone noted his recommendations to prevent such attacks, including using a hardware wallet to secure personal cryptocurrency holdings and using a YubiKey for 2FA. In cases in which a YubiKey is not supported, he recommends using Google Voice 2FA, since he claims those numbers are not vulnerable to SIM swapping.

Lastly, Coonce also suggests using a password manager and reducing a user’s personal online footprint by publicly sharing less personal information online. He stated that he “can’t stop thinking about the small, easy things I could have done to protect myself along the way,” and added:

“Given my naive security practices, I probably deserved to get hacked.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, United States blockchain and crypto investor Michael Terpin has won $75.8 million in a civil case against 21-year-old Nicholas Truglia, who reportedly defrauded him of crypto assets through SIM swapping.

Also in May, the U.S. Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment charging a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-crypto-exchanges-see-threefold-increase-in-new-accounts-since-march,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges have seen new account openings increase up to 200% in the past two months, Cointelegraph Japan reported on May 22.

Data obtained from three major trading platforms — Bitpoint, DMM Bitcoin and Coincheck — pointed to a significant increase in interest from entry-level investors since the end of March.

The change in habits among those who assumedly did not use cryptocurrency before highlights the impact of rising prices on consumer interest, which rose in step with the return of a bull market across the industry.

Daily account openings for Bitpoint were three times as high in May as for March, and twice more than in April.

DMM saw May openings double those in March and 1.5 times more than in April, while Coincheck likewise saw openings treble in May compared to March.

Coincheck’s PR department told Cointelegraph Japan that the local peak occurred on May 14, which saw seven times more accounts coming online than on the average day in March.

The data corresponds to Bitcoin prices between $3,750 and $4,150 in March, while May 14 saw BTC/USD trade around $8,250.

As Cointelegraph reported, it was not just Japan’s exchange sector that capitalized on the resurgence. This week, Kraken unleashed an equity sale which has gained over €8 million ($9.3 million) in two days.

Prior to that, a so-called initial exchange offering by fellow exchange Bitfinex meanwhile sold $1 billion of tokens to private investors.",

May 2019 has seen bitcoin growing, with its price climbing to its highest points since September 2018. Not surprisingly, cybercrooks were quick to notice this development and started upping their efforts in targeting cryptocurrency users with various scams and malicious apps.

One such app was recently spotted on Google Play by Reddit users, impersonating the popular hardware cryptocurrency wallet Trezor and using the name “Trezor Mobile Wallet”. We haven’t previously seen malware misusing Trezor’s branding and were curious about the capabilities of such a fake app. After all, Trezor offers hardware wallets that require physical manipulation and authentication via PIN, or knowledge of the so called recovery seed, to access the stored cryptocurrency. Similar constraints apply to its official app, “TREZOR Manager”.

Analyzing the fake app, we found that:

it can’t to do any harm to Trezor users given Trezor’s multiple security layers; it is connected to a fake cryptocurrency wallet app named “Coin Wallet – Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Tether”, which is capable of scamming unsuspecting users out of money; and both these apps were created based on an app template sold online.

We have reported the fake Trezor app to Google’s security teams and reached out to Trezor about the publication of this blogpost. Trezor confirmed the fake app did not pose a direct threat to their users. However, they did express concern that the email addresses collected via fake apps such as this one could be later misused for phishing campaigns targeted against Trezor users.

At the time of writing, neither the fake Trezor app nor the Coin Wallet app are available on Google Play.

The fake Trezor app

The app masquerading as a mobile wallet for Trezor was uploaded to Google Play on May 1, 2019 under the developer name “Trezor Inc.”, as seen in Figure 1. Overall, the app’s page on Google Play appeared trustworthy – the app name, developer name, app category, app description and images all seem legitimate at first glance. At the time of our analysis, the fake app even came up as the second result when searching for “Trezor” on Google Play, right after Trezor’s official app.

What does it do?

The convincing disguise, however, begins and ends on Google Play. After installation, the icon that appears on users’ screens differs from the one seen on Google Play, which serves as a clear indicator of something fishy. The icon of the installed app has “Coin Wallet” in it, as seen in Figure 2.

Furthermore, when users launch the app, a generic login screen is displayed, with no mention of Trezor, as seen in Figure 3. This is another indicator we are not dealing with a legitimate app. This generic screen is used to phish for login credentials – but it is unclear exactly what credentials, and what possible use they could be to attackers. Either way, whatever users enter into the fake login form is sent to the attacker’s server, as shown in Figure 4.

As seen in Figure 4, the server used to harvest credentials from the fake Trezor app is hosted on coinwalletinc[.]com. Looking into the domain led us to another fraudulent app, named “Coin Wallet” on its website and “Coin Wallet – Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Tether” on Google Play. This app is described in the following section of this blogpost.

The Coin Wallet app

The Coin Wallet app and the fake Trezor app described in the previous section have a lot in common – besides using the same server, they also overlap in code and interface. The Coin Wallet app uses the same icon that we have seen in the fake Trezor app after installation.

On its website, the Coin Wallet app is described as the “World’s leading Coin Wallet”, as seen in Figure 5.

The website contains a link to Google Play, where the app was available from February 7, 2019 until May 5, 2019 under the name “Coin Wallet – Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Tether”, as seen in Figure 6. During that time, it was installed by more than 1000 users.

The website also appears to link to Apple’s App Store, but clicking the “Available on the App Store” button only leads to the URL of the PNG image.

What does it do?

The app claims it lets its users create wallets for various cryptocurrencies. However, its actual purpose is to trick users into transferring cryptocurrency into the attackers’ wallets – a classic case of what we named wallet address scams in our previous research of cryptocurrency-targeting malware.

How this works is that the app pretends to generate a unique wallet address where users can transfer their coins. In reality, this address belongs to the attackers’ wallet, as only they have the private key necessary for accessing the funds. The attackers have one wallet for each supported cryptocurrency – 13 wallets altogether – and all victims with any specific targeted cryptocurrency are given the same wallet address.

Looking at the shared graphic elements of this and the fraudulent Trezor app, it seems that both have been created on the same basis. A Google search for “coinwallet app template” returns a generic “Android cryptocurrency wallet template” available for $40. The template itself is a benign asset turned malicious in the hands of attackers; however, we see here how such assets may be used by more attackers to create deceptive apps quickly and cheaply.

How to stay safe

If bitcoin continues its growth trend, we can expect more cryptocurrency scam apps to emerge in the official Android app store and elsewhere. When installing apps, it is important to stick to some basic security principles – even more so when money is at stake.

Only trust cryptocurrency-related and other finance apps if they are linked from the official website of the service

Only enter your sensitive information into online forms if you are certain of their security and legitimacy

Keep your device updated

Use a reputable mobile security solution to block and remove threats

The longer Bitcoin price remained stuck at resistance around $8,000, the more likely it was to correct. Just yesterday analysts were talking of a big run up over $9k but that has all changed during Asian trading this morning as a pullback has initiated, dropping over $10 billion from crypto markets.

A few hours ago Bitcoin plunged 6.7 percent from an intraday high of $8,040 to $7,500 according to Tradingview.com. Since then it has recovered marginally to trade at $7,640 but the long-awaited pullback appears to have finally begun.

Bitcoin Double-Top

Checking the charts shows a clear double top formation, which BTC is now pulling back from. Since breaking the $8k barrier on May 13, Bitcoin price 00 topped out at just over $8,300 three times but failed to break through. Analysts are now eyeing support zones to see how low Bitcoin will go.

Yesterday there was talk of a surge over $9k but there was also the notion that Bitcoin has yet to have a 30% correction during the current rally which started in February. A pullback of this magnitude would send Bitcoin back to the $5,800 area.

According to crypto trader ‘The Cryptomist,’ who forewarned about this drop, there are two levels of support to look out for;

.Forewarned this drop earlier, and secured most of this month’s profits. I expect us to drop further and test support upon 7.4k region. 1D Rsi still needs to drop. If this support breaks, 6.8k is next regional support.

Trader Josh Rager, however, is not concerned as he sees the current pattern holding horizontal supports;

$BTC still in this condensing formation and held by horizontal supports. Not a lot has changed which shows that you don’t have to stare at charts all day – waiting for that next massive candle.

$10 Billion Dumped

Either way, over $10 billion has been dumped from total crypto market capitalization which was at $250 billion this time yesterday. At the time of writing it had dropped below $239 billion and was still falling. As usual the altcoins have been hit harder with several suffering double-digit losses.

Ethereum has lost over 5 percent and is heading back towards $240. Stellar and Cardano are both losing around 8 percent while XRP and Bitcoin Cash are not far behind with 6 percent slides. In even more pain is Bitcoin SV, Cosmos and NEM dumping 11 percent apiece. There are very few altcoins escaping the red tide today as Bitcoin heads for lower levels in a move that many had anticipated and even welcomed.

AT&T will process bills paid in cryptocurrency using crypto payments platform BitPay.

BitPay is a platform that converts cryptocurrencies to fiat and is used by over 20,000 businesses. AT&T is reportedly the first United States-based business in the wireless network industry to offer bill payments with BitPay.

Kevin McDorman, vice president of AT&T Communications Finance Business Operations, said, “We have customers who use cryptocurrency, and we are happy we can offer them a way to pay their bills with the method they prefer.”

Near the end of 2018, AT&T announced that it was working on a suite of blockchain solutions compatible with Microsoft Azure and the IBM Blockchain Platform. The stated aim of the suite is to provide “additional transparency and accountability to even the most complex supply chains” for institutional customers in fields such as manufacturing, retail, and healthcare.

AT&T also filed a patent application — which was published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in December — for a blockchain-based “social media history map” that would allow a network such as AT&T to gather its subscribers' social media “transaction” data. As per the application:",,https://www.coindesk.com/robinhood-opens-trading-for-7-cryptocurrencies-in-new-york,"Robinhood, the popular stock and crypto investing app, has officially launched bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrency trading in New York.

Silicon Valley-based Robinhood received a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in January 2019 and on Thursday opened access to crypto trading in the Empire State.

From the press release:

Currently, you can invest in seven cryptocurrencies on Robinhood Crypto: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. You can also track price movements and news for those and 10 additional cryptocurrencies.

New York is unique and problematic for crypto traders because all purveyors must apply for a BitLicense, most notably for companies that are “storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of others,” according to NYDFS.

Many crypto startups have avoided the requirements entirely by becoming BitLicense refugees and refusing to do business in the state.

“Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license. That’s the absurdity of what’s happened here,” ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees complained in 2018 when asked about the controversial license at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in New York.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street’s self-regulatory organization (SRO), has approved public quotation of shares in the trust, Grayscale Investments announced Thursday.

“All kinds of investors will be able to gain exposure to the price movement of ethereum without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping ethereum,” wrote Marissa Arnold, a spokesperson for Grayscale, in an email to CoinDesk.

The trust managed about $7.5 million worth of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap as of April 30, according to Grayscale’s website.

The security will trade over the counter (OTC) under the symbol ETHE. Entry-level investors will be able to own and trade an instrument tied to ethereum alongside their shares of Apple and IBM. The trust, created in December 2017, previously was open only to accredited investors and required a minimum $25,000 investment.

Grayscale has not yet determined exactly when the security will be available for trading (it estimated this will take about two weeks), but the FINRA approval is an important step in the process.

Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Bank of Russia, said Thursday that her institution is to review a proposal for the development of the cryptocurrency.

Nabiullina said at the nation’s lower house, or Duma:

“As for mutual settlements, we will consider, of course, [the] proposal on … a gold-backed cryptocurrency. But, in my opinion, it is more important to develop settlements in national currencies,” she said at the State Duma.

She added that fiat currency settlement systems within the Eurasian Economic Union are improving and have “good dynamics.”

The news is perhaps surprising, as Russia’s government has been famously anti-crypto in past years, moving to block foreign exchange platforms from the country in 2017 and even blocking media sites that covered the topic back in 2015. A minister once said that Russia would never make cryptocurrencies legal.

However, the nation has softened its stance somewhat in more years, with moves to legislate around cryptocurrency starting in 2017. A digital assets bill could be passed this current session of the Duma, TASS indicates.

According to today’s report, Nabiullina said that, while it may mull the use of the gold-backed cryptocurrency, the central bank is against the use of cryptocurrency in Russia’s monetary system.

“We do not see the possibility that cryptocurrencies could act as monetary surrogates. Definitely not in this part,” she said.

Bestmixer.io has been seized and shut down by European police for reportedly laundering over $200 million in cryptocurrency.

On Wednesday, Europol, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), and Luxembourg authorities said six servers used to facilitate the service were seized in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Bestmixer launched in May 2018. Only a month later, police began investigating the mixing service and found that over the course of one year, the ""world's leading cryptocurrency mixing service"" had managed to launder at least $200 million in cryptocurrency on behalf of customers.

The cryptocurrency processed through Bestmixer was considered potentially ""tainted"" -- in other words, connected to illegal activities and theft.

The service was able to mix Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). By ""mixing"" these tainted coins with others, it is possible to clean up funds and eradicate ties to criminal activities written in the blockchain ledger in a process also known as ""washing.""

Cybersecurity firm McAfee assisted law enforcement in the Bestmixer investigation. In a blog post on Wednesday, John Fokker, Head of Cybersecurity Investigations at McAfee said mixing often involves slices up cryptocurrency into hundreds of small transactions which become lost in transactions from other sources.

A commission is then taken from the original sum before the funds are diverted to another output address, free of ledger entries which may criminalize the owners.

McAfee

""Mixing Bitcoins that are obtained legally is not a crime but, other than the mathematical exercise, there no real benefit to it,"" Fokker said. ""The legality changes when a mixing service advertises itself as a success[ful] method to avoid various anti-money laundering policies via anonymity. This is actively offering a money laundering service.""

TechRepublic: The current cybersecurity landscape of guerrilla warfare

This is exactly what Bestmixer offered. The service appeared on cryptocurrency-related forums over the past year and on its website explained to potential customers how mixing their cryptocurrency enabled them to circumvent anti-money-laundering policies.

""The investigation so far into this case has shown that many of the mixed cryptocurrencies on Bestmixer.io had a criminal origin or destination,"" Europol says. ""In these cases, the mixer was probably used to conceal and launder criminal flows of money.""

IP addresses, transaction details, Bitcoin wallet addresses and chat message logs have all been secured from the seized servers. The FIOD and Europol intend to analyze this data further and potentially share their findings with other countries.

Earlier in May, Europol, together with law enforcement agencies from Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the US seized servers used by the Wall Street Market, a Dark web trading post which specialized in the illegal sale of drugs, weaponry, and hacking tools, alongside stolen information.

The cryptocurrency is technological feat and while its inner workings are often difficult to understand, or explain, there are a few interesting facts every enthusiast should know.

We’ve rounded up some of the most interesting facts about Bitcoin.

1. Satoshi Nakamoto is very rich

The identity of Bitcoin‘s inventor, or inventors, remains a mystery but we do know they are very rich.

It’s estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by Bitcoin‘s creator, has mined and owns around 980,000 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $6.9 billion at the time of writing.

2. The US government owns LOTS of Bitcoin

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may have been created to circumvent governments and their reach, but the truth is that at one given time, the FBI had the second-largest Bitcoin wallet after Satoshi Nakamoto.

In late 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road, an online drug marketplace, and began seizing Bitcoins belonging to Ross Ulbricht (also known as Dread Pirate Roberts), the operator of the illicit website.

At the time, the seizure resulted in a lot of discussion about the cryptocurrency‘s future and saw the FBI control more than 144,000 BTC.

3. No private key, no Bitcoin

If you were to forget about your credit card pin (guilty!) you can easily retrieve your money by contacting your bank and proving your identity. Right?

Well, when it comes to Bitcoin, it’s not so easy. If you misplace your private keys, you’ll lose all your coins.

In fact, back in 2013, IT worker James Howells lost 7,500 BTC which, at the time, were worth approximately $127 million. He claimed that he accidentally threw away a hard disk, which contained the Bitcoin private keys he had mined overt he past three years.

4. Bitcoin supply is limited

Central banks control the creation and supply of money as the see fit.

However, Bitcoin has a limited and finite supply of 21 million.

Currently, there are more than 17.7 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the last coin is due to be mined in 2140.

5. No, Bitcoin can’t be banned

It doesn’t take much to see why governments don’t like Bitcoin, but the reality is that the cryptocurrency can’t be banned, only regulated.

The network is designed in such a way that as long as you have an internet connection and a Bitcoin wallet, you can buy and exchange the cryptocurrency.

So, there you have it. If anyone were to ask you about Bitcoin tomorrow, you should now be able to recite a few interesting facts off the cuff.",2019-05-24,https://blockpublisher.com/it-is-legal-to-buy-bitcoin-in-china-despite-a-crypto-ban/,"The People’s Republic of China has been making headlines in the crypto space for its strict outlook on the crypto ecosystem, especially regarding the blanket on the trading of cryptos. However, despite the ban the state hasn’t criminalized owning bitcoin.

According to Sa Xiao, a Council Member at the Bank of China’s Law Research Association, it is legal for individuals to own bitcoin in China. As per CnLedger, a local recognized crypto news source, Xiao even considers the occasional exchange of bitcoins between individuals as legal.

Owning bitcoin has been deemed legal because it is considered property or a commodity of value in many major markets. Similarly, occasional peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, as per Xiao, could be recognized as one of the rights of ownership and may not be punishable by law.

Xiao’s views are grounded in the current legal framework of the country which protects people’s rights to owning virtual properties, including cryptocurrency as bitcoin. According to the CnLedger:

Occasional P2P tradings of bitcoin are in nature ‘disposition right’, one of the rights of ‘ownership’. Therefore owning & occasional P2P trading is legal.

China has harbored skepticism about cryptocurrencies for quite some time now. The start of this troubled relationship can be charted back to 2013 when the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) noticed that the coin was gaining popularity in the country. Later that year in December, the watchdog along with five other government bodies issued an official announcement, titled “Notice on Preventing Financial Risk of Bitcoin”.

In that announcement, they identified and explained several factors in order to provide a warning to the investors. One of the most emphasized factors was low safety due to the lack of a centralized entity behind the currency.

Following that all the banks and financial organizations in the country were prohibited to facilitate and carry out any crypto-related operations. Furthermore, companies offering any bitcoin-related service were obliged to register with the relevant authorities and to strictly follow the know-your-customer (KYC) procedures in order to prevent incidents of money laundering or tax evasion.

In 2017, Chinese regulators launched a crackdown on individuals and firms who were raising funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs) and deemed them as illegal activity. This move was aimed at protecting investors and ‘dealing with risks properly’, obviously referring to the risks that accompany ICOs.

There was an ICO boom during this time period and while there were legit ICOs undoubtedly, but a fair share of companies were jumping on the bandwagon because it was largely an unregulated space, and thus an easy way to raise cash. Hence, it’s no surprise that the risk-averse China decided to impose a ban on this type of fundraising before it “disrupts their social order”, as the central bank said.

Furthermore, the state also ordered the cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down, particularly those offering to trade cryptocurrencies for fiats. As a result, over 15 players, including the three largest exchanges — OkCoin, Huobi and BTCChina — had to cease their local businesses.

Later in 2018, there was another restrictive move on crypto as the state banned peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms and over-the-counter deals. Later on, offshore cryptocurrency exchanges and foreign ICO websites were added to the Great Firewall.

China serves as a home for a vast majority of cryptocurrency miners, even so the local mining industry has been a target of suppression. According to reports, the Chinese government in 2018 pushed crypto miners to make an “orderly exit” from the industry due to tax issues and mining being generally dangerous for the environment.

Moreover, the country’s top internet-finance regulator, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, ordered local authorities to use all available options, such as “measures linked to electricity prices, land use, tax, and environmental protection”, in order to force miners to shut down their business.

Recently, an agency under the Chinese government purportedly suggested a complete ban on bitcoin mining, possibly in an attempt to restructure the crypto market in country’s favor.

Since China dominates the bitcoin mining industry, both in terms of the actual mining of BTC as well as manufacturing the rigs that support the activity elsewhere, the entire crypto industry took to Twitter following the breaking news.

Of course, China fears bring out the trolls. Let's be clear: China banning PoW mining doesn't mean they are banning rig manufacture. It doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin. You'd think that maximalist trolls would have higher confidence and thicker skin. — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) April 9, 2019

Some are even calling it nothing more than a FUD.

""China says it wants to eliminate bitcoin mining""#Bitcoin Fud pic.twitter.com/t11kNWD695 — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) April 9, 2019

While the latest news of owning bitcoin being legal in the country might be surprising but there are no signs that China intends to ease its pressure on the crypto sector as of now.

However, little was known about it outside of the company developing a mysterious blockchain department and rumours about a WhatsApp-based digital coin being launched by the firm.

According to a report published today by Forbes more details of the project have emerged. Nothing is particularly exciting about today’s revelations but we really wish the publication would drop the “rival to Bitcoin” angle.

Facebook Announces Further Details of its Intranet to Bitcoin’s Internet

The social media giant Facebook has disclosed further details about its plans to launch a digital currency (very) loosely inspired by Bitcoin. The company will reportedly be launching “GlobalCoin” – snappy, we know – in early 2020 and will offer some form of payments network between a dozen countries at first.

According to reports, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, met with Bank of England governor, Mark Carey, to discuss the plans and has also put the idea to US Treasury officials, as well as money transfer firms, and the top brass at the Gemini crypto exchange.

Zuckerberg told a Facebook developer conference last month that he thought payments was an area that the firm could really make things easier for people. However, the move also stinks of a desperate attempt to stay relevant amid dwindling users and security controversies such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year.

Fast, Cheap, Centralised Payments, Two out of Three Ain’t Bad, Right?

The fact that today’s announcement did not move the Bitcoin market whatsoever could be evidence of a much more mature market – particularly given that publications like Forbes seem hell bend on branding GlobalCoin as an alternative to Bitcoin. The very headline of the article is “Facebook And WhatsApp Break Cover With Bitcoin Rival Plans”, it then goes on to reference the scheme as a rival to Bitcoin multiple times in the text.

Facebook is gearing up to launch a rival to bitcoin as soon as next year as it accelerates plans to diversify its revenue away from advertising https://t.co/UB3kQP91vu pic.twitter.com/jCYNHG8eI3 — Forbes (@Forbes) May 24, 2019

However, the two couldn’t really be any different. The truly inspiring and remarkable thing about Bitcoin is how difficult it is to stop someone using the network. Aside from physically restraining an individual, the is no way anyone can halt a value transfer. Users need to trust no single entity. Whilst specific details of the launch of GlobalCoin are still shadowy at best, we can state with almost absolute clarity, if Zuckerberg needs to schmooze up to the US Treasury and the Bank of England to get an A-OK , there will be very little world-changing or disruptive about it. It therefore represents competition to the dollar, euro, or yen, rather than Bitcoin itself, which is potentially much more liberating and powerful.

In the following video, Bitcoin evangelist discusses the kind of private versions of digital assets that firms such as Facebook and JP Morgan have been exploring recently:

The social media executive’s stance could not be more different from that of crypto, and more specifically Bitcoin, uber-optimist Jack Dorsey. Dorsey is Zuckerberg’s equivalent at Twitter and nicely demonstrates how a CEO not hell-bent on world domination behaves.

He sees radical freedom-creating opportunity in Bitcoin so has decided to back companies developing on it, provide consistent price support with $10,000 monthly buys, and champions the network at every available opportunity. Every heard of TwitterCoin? No, neither have we. That’s because he doesn’t want his hands all over your wallet, as well as every detail of your personal life.

Whilst GlobalCoin poses little risk to Bitcoin itself, some from the crypto asset space are optimistic about how the news will impact the the purely decentralised asset. Spencer Bogart of Blockchain Capital recently speculated on the on boarding potential of such a scheme:

“It will be like being on the internet so people can spin-out and start owning bitcoin, Ethereum… Bitcoin has gone from zero users ten years ago to somewhere between 30 million to 100 million–the estimates are tough. And Facebook has billions of users.”

Traders from Iran have been banned from using the peer-to-peer trading platform Localbitcoins.com within the country. The Iranian section of the website displays a short message that states that the exchange is “currently not available.” The news follows significant Iranian rial trade volume on the Localbitcoins platform, which has been climbing steadily over the last few weeks.

Iranians Can No Longer Trade Within the Country Using Localbitcoins

The Helsinki-based BTC exchange Localbitcoins.com has stopped servicing Iranian residents but hasn’t disclosed why it made the decision. Over the last few weeks, however, tensions have been rising in the Middle East between Iran and the U.S. For instance, last week the U.S. military put regional soldiers on high alert and the State Department asked nonemergency federal employees to leave the country. The move from Localbitcoin.com is likely due to harsh economic sanctions leveled against Iran. The U.S. imposed sanctions against Iran in 1979 and since then members of the United Nations have also participated in trade bans. Over the last few years, reports have detailed that Iranian residents have been using cryptocurrencies to escape these sanctions so they can buy products and services overseas.

BTC trade volumes stemming from the data aggregation website Coin Dance show that there’s been significant trading taking place in Iran up until Localbitcoins decided to geo-restrict the nation. The week of May 18 showed some of the highest levels of Iranian rial Localbitcoins volumes since the crypto bull run in 2017. Localbitcoins rial-measured trade volumes were steadily climbing for weeks leading up until the decision to stop service in the oil-rich nation. According to a screenshot of the Localbitcoins support team talking to an Iranian user, residents from the region have been told they can withdraw their BTC, but they cannot trade on the platform. When an individual visits the Iranian Localbitcoins URL there is a notice which states:

Unfortunately, Localbitcoins is currently not available in your selected region — Please look for other location or come back later.

Bypassing Strict Economic Sanctions

Cryptocurrencies have become a popular medium of exchange in Iran, but regulatory uncertainty also stems from Iranian government officials and the country’s central bank. A few days ago on Bitcoin Pizza Day, a group of Iranians got together in Tehran to celebrate. The owner of the restaurant where the meetup took place, Reza Abdollahi, told the press: “We have up to 200 people paying with crypto each month, mostly consisting of large groups who throw parties at the restaurant to use the discount.” Abdollahi also said that a great majority of those payments derive from people using ethereum (ETH) as well. The Tehran-based Blockchain Academy educator, Tina Kheiri, added to the commentary by stating:

Scores of people are mining cryptocurrencies and some businesspeople are using parts of their factories as mining farms, which I think is great under sanctions.

Iranians flocking to cryptos really started heating up after U.S. president Trump told the world he would withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose far stricter economic sanctions. Additionally, miners stemming from China and other regions throughout the world have been moving operations to Iran for cheap electricity. Reports have noted that Chinese miners have found $0.006 per kilowatt-hour. Last December, Iranian college students used bitcoin to bypass economic sanctions to purchase school supplies and books. The Localbitcoins ban will be a deep blow to traders within the country seeking to acquire digital currency in a peer-to-peer fashion.

Although AT&T proudly advertises that it’s the first mobile operator in the US to accept cryptocurrency, it’s far from the first major business overall. Earlier this month a group of retailers that included Whole Foods, Nordstrom and GameStop all announced that they would be accepting payments using cryptocurrency via the payment network Flexa.

Steam accepted Bitcoin payments before later withdrawing support

However, in the past at least one retailer has withdrawn support for cryptocurrency payments due to “high fees and volatility.” Steam, which started accepting Bitcoin back in 2016, also used BitPay as a payment partner, but later announced that it would end support for the cryptocurrency in late 2017.

Similarly, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Bitcoin investments will outperform the S&P 500 investment fund over the next 10 years. According to him, the low correlation of the cryptocurrency with other asset classes is also a reason why it should be in every investors portfolio.

Facebook is in talks with the major cryptocurrency exchanges on the issue of its rumored cryptocurrency. The social media giant wants to ensure that its cryptocurrency is liquid, tradeable and secure. With fundamental factors supportive, how do the technicals look? Let’s find out.

BTC/USD

The trend in Bitcoin (BTC) is up. It held its first support of $7,413.46 on May 23, which is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

A breakdown of $7,413.46 and the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the momentum has weakened. If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the BTC/USD pair can drop to the next support of the 50-day SMA and below it to $5,900. We anticipate this level to hold.

On the upside, if the pair ascends $8,496.53, it can rally to the next resistance of $10,000, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. We do not find any reliable buy setups at current levels, hence, we are not suggesting a trade in it.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) has been holding above the support of $225.39 for the past few days. This shows strong demand at lower levels. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in positive territory. This shows that the bulls are in command.

The bulls will now try to push the ETH/USD pair to the overhead resistance of $268.24. Above this, a rally to the $300–$322 resistance zone is possible. The pair will lose momentum if it breaks down of the 20-day EMA and the trend will turn in favor of the bears if the 50-day SMA cracks. Though bullish, we do not find a reliable trade setup, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound from the current levels can carry it to the overhead resistance of $0.45. If the bulls succeed in ascending this resistance, the rally can extend to $0.60. Though there are minor resistances at $0.50 and $0.55, we expect them to be crossed.

Currently, both the moving averages are flattening out. This shows a balance between the bulls and the bears. A breakdown of the 20-day EMA will sink the XRP/USD pair to the next support of the 50-day SMA. This is just above the horizontal support of $0.33108. We expect this level to hold. Traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.2750.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 20-day EMA on May 23. The bulls are presently attempting to push the price towards the overhead resistance of $450. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone. This shows that the bulls are at an advantage.

However, we anticipate a stiff resistance between $450 and the resistance line of the ascending channel. The BCH/USD pair will weaken if it turns around from the overhead resistance and dips below the 20-day EMA. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA and below it the support line of the channel. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.

EOS/USD

EOS has bounced sharply from the 20-day EMA. This is a positive sign as it shows buying on dips. The bulls will now try to scale the overhead resistance of $6.8299. If successful, the pair can rally to $9. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This shows that the bulls have an edge. The only red flag is the developing negative divergence on the RSI.

We anticipate a stiff resistance at $6.8299. A turnaround from the resistance is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. The EOS/USD pair will weaken if it breaks below the moving averages. We might suggest long positions if the pair breaks out and sustains above $6.8299.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has broken out of the overhead resistance of $91 with force. This is a positive sign. The bulls will now try to scale the overhead resistance of $107. If successful, the cryptocurrency can rally to its target objective of $158.91. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are in command.

During the recent pullback, the LTC/USD pair held above the support of $84.3439. This is a bullish as it forms a new base for the cryptocurrency. A breakdown of this support will result in a fall to $74.6054. The traders can trail the stops on the long positions to $80. We do not like the negative divergence on the RSI, hence, let us reduce our risk.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) continues to be the strongest major cryptocurrency as it is consistently making new lifetime highs. Unlike previous occasions, the digital currency has not corrected to the 20-day EMA after reaching the resistance line. This suggests that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they expect a further rally.

The BNB/USD pair is attempting to climb above the resistance line once again. If successful, it can move up to $40.2919564. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the bulls have the upper hand. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair reverses direction from the resistance line and plummets below the moving averages.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) is attempting to hold the moving averages, which are flattening out. The RSI has also dipped to just above 50. This suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears.

A drop below the moving averages can sink the XLM/USD pair to $0.088542. Thereafter, the pair might remain stuck in the range of $0.088542 to $0.14861760 for the next few weeks.

Conversely, if the bulls hold the moving averages and push the price above $0.14861760, the pair might pick up momentum and rally to $0.22466773. We will wait for the price to close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760 before proposing a trade in it.

ADA/USD

The bulls are struggling to hold Cardano (ADA) above the moving averages for the past few days. Though the bulls bought the dip below the 20-day EMA on May 23, they have not been able to propel the cryptocurrency higher. This shows some buying on dips but a lack of demand at higher levels.

A close (UTC time frame) below $0.073 can result in a fall to the next support of $0.057898. Both the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is also close to the center. This points to a likely consolidation in the next few days.

But if the ADA/USD pair holds the current levels and scales above $0.094256, it will complete a reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275. Therefore, we maintain the trade recommendation given in an earlier analysis.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) has held the support at the moving averages and is attempting to rise back above the overhead resistance of $0.02815521. If the price sustains above this level, the digital currency is likely to pick up momentum. However, the digital currency has seen a number of failed breakouts in the past few months, hence, we will wait for the price to stay above the range for a few days before confirming the start of a new uptrend. The target level to watch on the upside is $0.040 and above it $0.050.

On the other hand, if the TRX/USD pair reverses direction from the overhead resistance and sinks below $0.0250, it can dip to the next support at $0.02094452. Both the moving averages are flattish and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This points to a range bound action for a few days. For now, the traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.0209.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/24/binance-margin-trading/,"Binance, the world’s most prominent crypto exchange, says it is close to adding a much-anticipated margin-trading feature to its service following weeks of speculation.

The company tweeted confirmation of the upcoming feature in a screenshot that subtly teases the imminent arrival of margin-trading options. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (pictured above) first revealed the feature was headed to Binance during a live stream following a hack earlier this month that saw Binance lose around $40 million in Bitcoin.

TechCrunch understands that margin trading has been beta tested among select users. A Binance representative declined to comment on the specifics, but did confirm that margin trading will be available on Binance.com “soon.”

Margin trading, which lets traders use their balance as collateral to super-size their buying power, is seen by many as an important growth vector for crypto trading. Binance is often the world’s largest exchange based on daily trading volumes — though it is currently ranked second, according to Coinmarketcap data — but it has avoided margin trading to date. Instead, exchanges like BitMex, Huobi Pro, Poloniex, Kraken and Coinbase’s GDAX have run with the ball and offered the functionality. Coinbase has also considered adding it for regular, retail customers.

The new feature is part of a number of expansions from Binance as it aims to broaden its reach. The company has added support for purchasing crypto using fiat currency in three countries — Jersey (for the U.K.), Uganda and most recently Singapore — while it also released an early version of its “decentralized” exchange (DEX) to offer further trading options.

Despite that hack, which saw Binance pause withdrawals and deposits for a week, the crypto market remains bullish on the company. Binance’s BNB token passed a $30 valuation this week for the first time in its history. Its worth is up 8% over the last 24 hours — that’s better than Bitcoin (5%), Ethereum (6%) and XRP (4%), which are crypto’s three largest tokens based on “coin market cap.”

There’s been excitement around Bitcoin’s rally in recent weeks, which saw its price briefly pass $8,000 a coin this month, but BNB has been the pick of crypto’s top tokens in 2019. Its value has increased more than five-fold since January 1, when it was worth $6. Today, it trades at $33, as of the time of writing.",2019-05-24,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-vs-litecoin-130029246.html,"Three of the most famous cryptocurrencies that most people have heard of are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

Three of the most famous cryptocurrencies that most people have heard of are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Not only have they survived longer than many others, but they have all maintained their strong positions in the rankings of most valuable cryptocurrencies. Each one has its own unique attributes that they hope will help them compete in an extremely volatile market.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency out there and also the original. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin is an uncensorable form of money that can be sent peer to peer anywhere in the world, without the need for a third party.

These unique attributes have garnered interest from libertarians, crypto-anarchists, and people unsatisfied with the current status quo of the economic system. It has also received derision from classical economists who point to the volatile price fluctuations as a clear example of a bubble in progress.

Despite being labelled “dead” on numerous occasions, Bitcoin has continued to survive and ultimately thrive. Not only is the price higher than most ever imagined, but there are now whole industries and conferences built around this one invention that was released on a mailing list all those years ago.

As a piece of software, Bitcoin continues to develop and evolve. New ideas such as the Lightning Network and Schnorr Signatures hope to help continue pushing Bitcoin further mainstream, with the ultimate goal being to overthrow the current fiat system. Such lofty goals have caught the attention of US congressmen who have called for cryptocurrencies to be made illegal due to fear of the US losing its hegemony through the use of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.

Criticism of Bitcoin is usually aimed at the Proof-of-Work hashing algorithm and the size of the network. Proof-of-Work is energy intensive, and many people have accused Bitcoin of being a waste of precious resources in a time when global warming is on the forefront of many people’s minds.

Story continues

Ethereum

Ethereum is the creation of Vitalik Buterin and doesn’t directly compete with Bitcoin in terms of its money properties. Instead, the smart contract-based platform has been labelled as a potential “world computer”. Despite this, for many people, cryptocurrencies are merely investment vehicles, meaning the underlying technology often gets overlooked for the price.

Ethereum has seen significant growth in price the same way as Bitcoin has. It has also created plenty of hype and excitement. Due to the nature of Ethereum, it is possible to build tokens on top of the platform. Many cryptocurrencies on the market today are ERC-20 tokens that use Ethereum as a base layer.

Whilst Ethereum has struggled to become the “world computer” many believe it can be, another use case was found for it in 2017. Ethereum became the vehicle for many projects to launch their ICOs. Unfortunately, many of these ICOs were shady and unscrupulous, meaning that although they raised millions of dollars, investors are yet to see any return.

Whilst Ethereum currently uses Proof-of-Work like Bitcoin, its ultimate goal is to move to Proof-of-Stake. Proof-of-Stake is less energy intensive and seemingly more palatable to mainstream consumers because of this.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle with issues relating to scaling their respective blockchains. Whilst the Lightning Network on Bitcoin is meant to help solve this, upgrades such as Casper on Ethereum should in theory help its scalability problems.

Litecoin

Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee and is a fork of the Bitcoin code with a few different parameters. Often referred to as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold”, the plucky altcoin has managed to survive to this day and is currently trading above $80.

Litecoin is quicker to transfer than Bitcoin, making it more suitable for payments. However, whether Litecoin will still be able to maintain a market share once the Lightning Network is fully integrated into Bitcoin remains to be seen. Through the Lightning Network, payments on Bitcoin will become quicker and cheaper than Litecoin, possibly rendering its use case null and void.

Litecoin has proved beneficial for Bitcoin. When the scaling debate was at its peak in 2017, Litecoin went ahead and implemented SegWit onto its platform. This showed that there were no issues with SegWit as Litecoin continued to run smoothly, calming some of the fears surrounding the new upgrade.

Founder Charlie Lee has previously been accused of undermining the project when he chose to sell all his holdings for more than $300 a coin in the last bull market. His argument was that he has too much influence over the price, and by selling he could focus solely on improving Litecoin. However, when he chose to sell, the price of Litecoin soon collapsed, leading many to accuse him of “dumping his bags”.

Conclusion

Bitcoin to this day remains the original and strongest cryptocurrency on the market. Whilst the interest around Ethereum is very high, there are still many questions that surround the project’s viability. This is true for Bitcoin in the long term as well, however.

Litecoin is a plucky altcoin that has proved a valuable asset as almost like a test net for Bitcoin. Each of these cryptocurrencies have shown that they have staying power so far, but this does not necessarily guarantee success for them in the future.

By CCN.com: Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright published a blistering manifesto that argues bitcoin (BTC) will eventually disappear because it’s being used to facilitate criminal activity. And that perverts his original vision for the cryptocurrency.

For reference, Wright has repeatedly claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin. He has yet to offer definitive proof.

Civil War Erupts Between Warring Crypto Factions

Wright is a proponent of Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision), which he insists is the “true bitcoin.”

Wright and his ally Calvin Ayre claim BSV will supplant all other fake pretenders to the bitcoin throne and will crush rivals BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) into the ground.

‘Bitcoin Needs to Act Within the Rules’

In a withering manifesto, Wright claims he created bitcoin to operate within the law and not to facilitate criminal activity like money-laundering and drug trafficking.

Wright then torched cryptocurrency evangelists who claim BTC is totally decentralized and therefore doesn’t need to play by any rules. However, Wright says they’re deluding themselves and need to be slapped awake.

“I designed Bitcoin to be a system that worked within the rules.” “Bitcoin needs to act within the rules. If it does not, then the exchanges and systems that allow people to use Bitcoin act to stop it being widely used and disseminated and criminalise all of those in the system.” “If Bitcoin or any other monetary system seeks to act outside the rules, it becomes an outlaw system, and once it does, it is easy to stop.” “The majority of people want rules. They don’t want to fight in a world of uncertainty, and want to know that the contract that they have conducted will remain valid not just now, but throughout the term of the exchange — for which we need rules.”

Craig Wright: Binance Facilitates Crime

Moreover, Wright insists that cryptocurrency exchanges are basically criminal enterprises that “facilitate money laundering.” Accordingly, he predicts that they will eventually go out of business “because crime will always fail.”

Specifically, Wright accused Binance and Bitfinex of lying to their customers when they claim to be decentralized. He says they’re not. Wright also explained that the only reason why anyone wants a decentralized financial platform is so they can use it to hide or launder money.

“Groups such as Binance who seek to facilitate money laundering and crime will always fail. They defraud you in telling you that they are decentralised and cannot be controlled. “Bitcoin is a system that was set in stone. If the protocol is changed, then it shows and demonstrates it is not Bitcoin. When those involved altered the rules, they impacted their entire ecosystem — it is a centralised power structure. They defraud you when they lie about decentralisation and tell you that they have no ability to change things but then alter the rules.” “When those in power are able to change the protocol, they can change the lives and the finances of those involved in the system at an arbitrary whim. It is why BTC is not Bitcoin.”

Wright: Bitcoin ‘Will Disappear In Moments’

Wright further claimed that because bitcoin has been manipulated, it will eventually disappear. And when that happens, he warned that it’ll vanish instantly.

“Where a blockchain does not follow the rules…it is simple for government to stop. When the action happens, as it did with e-gold, everything invested in the system will vanish in a flash. When BTC disappears, it will not disappear slowly, it will disappear in moments.”

Wright then concluded by promising that he’ll sign a Satoshi transaction after “I have definitively proven I created Bitcoin. Not before.”",2019-05-25 16:45:57+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-funds-lending-and-market-manipulation,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.

It’s not easy being a crypto fund manager. As well as unruly markets and elusive valuations, there’s the increasing competition and pressure on fees. And performance has been lackluster: Vision Hill’s Q1 report showed that, on average, active funds have underperformed bitcoin so far this year.

The bear market of 2018 triggered the closure of many crypto funds, and a report released last week by PwC and Elwood Asset Management showed that there are far fewer active funds in existence than we had been led to believe.

The report also pointed out that, given a median management fee of 2% and a median fund size of $4 million, operational sustainability is tough: $80,000 recurring income is not enough to cover salaries and other overheads, especially given the likelihood of increasing compliance requirements.

The PwC/Elwood report mentions some steps that funds are taking to boost recurring income, such as market making and advisory roles.

It overlooks one potentially significant source of revenue, however: crypto lending. Funds could lend out the assets they hold, for a fee.

Given the growing demand for crypto lending services, this potential income stream could be enough to give a number of funds a greater chance of survival, as well as inject liquidity and diversity into the sector.

It could also, however, add hidden risk to the market overall.

Heading down

Before we look in more detail at this risk, let’s examine the trend toward lower fees.

According to the PwC/Elwood report, the median (mid-point) fee is 2%. This is in line with typical fees for “traditional” hedge funds. But there are signs that they are coming down. The report states that the average crypto fund fee is 1.72%, which means that many charge significantly less. This is also in line with the traditional sector, where fee pressure is already becoming the subject of headlines.

The pressure is even more acute in mutual and index funds, where fees are moving to zero or even lower. Last year, investment management giant Fidelity offered a mutual fund with no management charge. And earlier this month, the SEC greenlighted a fund from asset manager Salt Financial that promised negative fees.

Meanwhile, demand for crypto lending is growing at an astonishing pace, as the inflow of funds into lending startups and the demand from institutions shows. While there is no concrete data on the extent to which crypto funds lend out their assets, there are signs that this practice is spreading.

This has potential implications for the entire sector, both good and bad.

Heads up

On the positive side, increased lending of crypto assets could increase velocity and, by extension, price discovery as a greater number of transactions makes it easier for a market to express its views.

Furthermore, a growing demand for short selling, facilitated by asset lending, will to some extent enhance liquidity and help to develop a pool of natural buyers – all short sales have to be unwound eventually. This develops a “soft” floor for an asset price.

But “more liquid” does not necessarily mean “liquid,” and here is where the risk of market manipulation could seep in.

Let’s say I manage a crypto fund that has invested in altcoin A, and let’s say that I lend out part of my stake to counterparty A. In traditional finance, most securities loans can be recalled at any time – let’s assume that I can do the same here. I recall the loan of altcoin A, and counterparty A has to scramble to get it back to me. Whether counterparty A used the loan to sell short or lent it on to counterparty B, it will now have to buy the asset back in the market, probably pushing up the price by doing so.

Now, what if I knew that would happen, and used the recall as part of a strategy to boost my fund valuation? True, I probably couldn’t lock in the profit by selling altcoin A without pushing the market back down, but it could serve to fix a higher value on a certain date, which would boost my reported performance, which in turn could encourage more investment in my fund.

Plus, there’s the added benefit of knowing that the short sellers got squeezed, and the glory of my outperformance compared to those with a more negative outlook.

Obviously, if I got a reputation for doing this, no-one would borrow from me. And the drying up of that revenue stream could mean that I may end up having to liquidate my fund – just imagine what my dumping all of my altcoin holdings on the market (after recalling all loans) would do to other funds’ valuations.

Eyes open

One solution could be for investors to insist that the funds they back do not engage in this type of lending activity. But, given the difficulty of covering costs with declining management fees, that could make it less likely that compliant funds survive. And if the returns from lending boost fund performance, am I not obliged to seek the best possible return for my investors? Most investors in crypto hedge funds are themselves institutions, who are also judged by their performance. There is for now little incentive to insist on curbs on lending.

Regulation could come in and establish rules over transparency and oversight, as is happening in traditional finance. But regulators are still getting their heads around the crypto space, and are doing so at a cautious pace.

In the absence of clear rules, it is up to the sector to keep an eye on developments in both crypto fund administration and crypto asset lending. It is, after all, in its own interest to ensure a smooth and robust market.

But self-regulation has its own risks and is hard to execute in as opaque an activity as crypto asset lending. True, blockchain-based transactions are available for all to see – but most crypto asset lending is likely to take place off-chain, as an agreement between two parties.

However, letting the practice spread without some guidance could escalate systemic risk. As the traditional markets saw in 2008, the intertwined web of asset holdings through through opaque lending arrangements left institutions vulnerable and investors grasping at air.

Crypto markets have enough hurdles to overcome to reach mainstream acceptance. We shouldn’t let hidden risks that develop in front of our very noses to be one of them.

At 19:00 UTC on May 26, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart, after being held beneath $8,250 for an extended period of time.

The move to fresh 2019 highs comes after the bitcoin price dropped to as low as $6,600 on May 17 before a large amount of buying pressure pushed prices back above $7,300 within the same day.

Since then the bitcoin price has again jumped by 22 percent, rising above $8,500 around 19:45 UTC on Sunday night and then reaching over $8,700 within half an hour. It’s currently changing hands at $8,890 per CoinDesk’s price data.

Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by a large uptick in the 24-hour trading volume, an increase of $10.3 billion was added overall, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management – currently stands at $3.1 billion, according to Messari.io.

Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like EOS, Ether (ETH), XRP, and litecoin (LTC) have gained between 5.3 to 5.8 percent each on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.

What’s more, the total market capitalization has risen to a high of $268.1 billion its highest point since August 3, 2018 while the market capitalization for altcoins is up $6 billion, a sign of continued funding and investment for cryptocurrencies overall.

Eyes are now firmly set on bitcoin’s new target along $9,650 resistance, last seen 13 months ago on April 30, 2018, signaling a very strong upward move beyond the $10,000 psychological price tag.

In addition to being a high-end fashion accessory, with a price ranging from $9,800 to $50,600, the watch reportedly also functions as a cold wallet for BTC. The watch is reported to be engraved with a public address on its dial and comes paired with a private key on a USB drive. According to the firm, the “deep cold storage wallet” is unhackable and uses “offline generated, non-deterministic TRNGs (True Random Numbers Generated).”

Shortly after Bitcoin SV was delisted from Binance, CoinDesk advisor Michael Casey published an insightful op-ed discussing whether the delisting amounted to censorship (it doesn’t), whether exchanges should be held to high standards of neutrality (they should) and whether regulation is necessary to achieve this result (it is).

The idea is that because major exchanges play such a crucial role in the industry (Casey claims that “[t]hey are the cryptocurrency industry) they should not be allowed to arbitrarily discriminate between crypto assets — rather they should be regulated to operate as neutral platforms.

But ask any regulation expert and they will tell you that, absent Goldilocks conditions (hold that thought), neutrality is neither the natural state of markets, nor the natural instinct of regulators.

If that’s the case, regulation of the kind that would have saved Bitcoin SV and of the kind Casey advocates for – while possible – might not quite be around the corner.

Neutrality is rare and regulation even rarer

That neutrality is not the natural state of markets, we’ve known for a while.

It is hard to notice when there is an abundance of choice and people get what they want, but when there is too little of something, the owner of that bottleneck resource often becomes partial and does not treat everyone the same.

When the first telephone networks were rolled out, they suppressed devices and services from competitors and even arbitrarily refused call service. Microsoft saw Netscape as a threat and sabotaged it. Apple and AT&T similarly blocked Skype in the early days of the iPhone. There are countless other examples of platforms disfavoring complements or customers.

Were regulators called in to save the day in all these cases? They were indeed. Telephone networks were designated as common carriers, which came with the obligation to provide non-discriminatory service; Microsoft was forced by antitrust regulators to abandon the practices that squeezed Netscape out of the market; and Apple and AT&T dropped their restrictions against Skype after the Federal Communications Commission threatened them with net neutrality action.

It may seem that regulation came to the rescue whenever necessary to restore neutrality. But the truth is that despite occasional corrections, neutrality still remains the exception in the market and in regulatory action.

Part of the reason is that the law actually acknowledges that non-neutrality is not all that bad. The ability to deviate from uniform practice is what allows companies to differentiate themselves in the market. Not all grocery stores carry the same products, neither do they all place them in the exact same shelf, and this helps consumers and producers address diversified needs.

Even extreme differentiation, like exclusive agreements that make a business proposition unique in the market, can be good. For example, Nintendo’s exclusive console agreements helped bootstrap an entire industry by tying popular games to Nintendo’s consoles thereby increasing competition.

It is not that this kind of discriminatory practices have no downsides. Far from it. But it is also a standard assumption in modern market-driven economies is that regulation distorts markets too, and therefore, the enactment of rules requires proof that, left alone, the market would perform demonstrably worse.

In the mind of a regulator

To decide whether Binance, or any exchange for that matter, should be neutral and not discriminate against crypto assets (be it cryptocurrencies, crypto derivatives or other), regulators would consider a number of factors.

Power



The most decisive factor to regulate is sustained monopoly power or dominance in the market.

Regulators usually impose neutrality on platforms because users and/or complements (read: cryptocurrencies) can’t or realistically won’t turn to alternative platforms, which would allow the dominant platform to exploit them.

If Binance were a monopoly exchange, then delisting a cryptocurrency would result in driving it out of the market. Or, if the cost of switching from Binance to another exchange was prohibitively high, then, similarly, Binance users and listed cryptocurrencies would be trapped by Binance’s choices.

But neither of those conditions are true here. There are numerous exchanges on which Bitcoin SV can be traded, and signing up with Binance does not preclude users from trading on other exchanges too. In other words, both Bitcoin SV and users multi-home.

In that sense, Bitcoin SV is not in the same position as companies listed on NYSE or Nasdaq, because by and large, companies are listed on only one exchange, and delisting them would mean that they cease to be publicly traded.

Harm and market distortion



Regardless of power, would decisions such as Binance’s delisting of Bitcoin SV undermine important public interest goals such as market stability and efficiency, consumer and investor protection, and capital formation?

Regulation is more likely if the problematic conduct threatens harm to public interest goals, is frequent, and has long-lasting effects without second-best alternatives being able to contain them.

At the moment, the picture is still fluid. For one thing, regulators still grapple with the question of whether crypto assets even form part of financial markets. If they do not, then there would be no legal basis to subject exchanges to financial regulation.

Assuming that they do, the frequency of the problematic conduct matters too. Crypto delisting is not unheard of but it is not exactly common either. There is no exact formula to calculate a threshold. In the case of network neutrality rules, fewer than five instances were enough to set the regulatory process in motion, whereas for privacy, numerous and repeated instances by tech giants have not resulted in regulation yet.

We also don’t know the extent of the harm of delisting. When the trading of conventional securities is suspended, they effectively disappear from the market, perhaps permanently. On the other hand, despite Bitcoin SV’s delisting from Binance, it still traded on another seven exchanges.

To be sure, Bitcoin SV’s price suffered significantly upon the announcement of the delisting on April 15 (from $73 on April 14 to $55 on April 15), and the effects to its medium-long term liquidity and reputation are yet to be accounted for (likely bleak).

This, in turn, can have severe consequences for investors’ financial situation.

But regulation is concerned with broad effects, not individual actors. The key lies less in the fate of Bitcoin SV specifically, and more in the effect of the practice of delisting in the overall stability of the market. It is a very different situation if delisting is regarded as a normal business practice whose risk is acceptably assumed by investors, and if delisting is regarded as serving no other purpose but to manipulate the market or to defraud investors. Only the latter could invite regulation.

Information inadequacies



The market can only work efficiently if all parties are sufficiently well informed to evaluate their options.

If investors had perfect information, then their reactions to Bitcoin SV’s delisting would reflect their up-to-date assessment, and there would be no need for regulation to protect them from anything. Any price, reputation and liquidity fluctuations would correspond to investors’ full and accurate beliefs and manipulation by Binance would be impossible.

This is clearly not the case here or in any other market. Perfect information is one of the most unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical economics in modern economies.

But the obvious solution to information inadequacies is more information and more transparency, not neutrality. The difference is that transparency enables actors to make a (presumably better) choice, whereas neutrality is a choice itself: it mandates a specific treatment (i.e. non-discrimination).

Regulators would normally want to start with the least onerous measure (transparency). If it is not effective, they can escalate to neutrality. If still ineffective, they may even dictate the rules of listing and delisting themselves.

Unequal bargaining power and anticompetitive conduct

The main idea behind non-regulated competitive markets is that actors behave well because market forces discipline them. If, however, the competitive forces exercised by competitors (other exchanges), complements (cryptoassets) or customers (investors) are weak, market players (exchanges) are unconstrained to act in ways that harm others.

Think about how much more difficult it would be for an exchange to delist Bitcoin with its much higher market capitalization, velocity and liquidity compared to Bitcoin SV.

Evidently, Bitcoin is more valuable to exchanges and therefore the constraints around how exchanges treat it are tighter. In reality, the majority of cryptocurrencies are nowhere near as important as Bitcoin, and the fact that they are not backed by unified institutional actors further diminishes their bargaining power.

Large investors could have a similar constraining effect, since exchanges would not want to lose investors who can generate large volumes.

For this to work it would mean that cryptocurrency ownership is concentrated in large investors (there is evidence in that direction, for example 42 percent of Bitcoin is owned by the top 0.01 of addresses), but also that these investors are actually active and that churn is high or at least plausible.

Politics, politics, politics

The factors listed above leave out one important aspect of regulation: the fact that, ultimately, it is a political game, not an academic exercise. If politics favor regulation then that’s the most likely outcome regardless of how the factors listed above weigh in. We even have a fancy name for it: New Institutionalism.

As a function of the executive branch, regulation is subject to political pressure and revolves around interest groups. Nascent immature markets, such as that of cryptoassets, are usually captured by the interests of the existing regulatory authority and those of the public.

They are captured by the existing authority (in the US, this is the SEC) because they are already in the game and by extending their reach they justify their existence. Widened reach and heightened activity entitles them to more funding and higher rating. Just look at how everyone speaks of the European Commission as the global antitrust and privacy enforcer after having gone after Google and the like.

Nascent markets are also more likely to be regulated in the name of the public interest both because people are generally more vulnerable in new market contexts, and because industry interests have not developed lobbying capacity yet. This leaves the field clear to side with the public which is generally seen as the weaker side.

A few industry associations are already present in blockchain markets (EEA, PTDL, ISDA) but none seems to represent the collective interests of exchanges. On the contrary, regulatory interest and grassroots support for crypto assets seem stronger.

In the end, it is usually not a question of whether a market segment will be regulated or not; rather a question of how it will be regulated.

Instant messaging service Telegram reportedly plans to launch its Telegram Open Network (TON) in the third quarter of this year. It has created a new programming language called Fift, which will help develop and manage TON blockchain smart contracts and interact with the TON Virtual Machine.

On the other hand, Facebook is allegedly planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in early 2020. The company expects its large user base to start using its cryptocurrency in a dozen countries for making purchases, transferring money and more. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, has reportedly discussed the project with U.S. Treasury officials along with Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.

Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz believes that one of the crypto assets created by the above-mentioned companies is likely to be successful and can even have a “chance to be a real currency.” He also reiterated that the “crypto winter is over” in comments this week. And, according to token rating platform ICObench, the ICO sector is showing a higher success rate as the sentiment improves.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin sv (BSV) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies with a rally of above 60% in the past seven days. The boost came amid the news that nChain founder Craig Wright had filed United States copyright registrations for the Bitcoin white paper and the original code used to build Bitcoin. However, the bitcoin community and a few experts do not consider this to be an important event that can alter the fortunes of bitcoin sv. But what do the charts project? Let us find out.

The BSV/USD pair skyrocketed this week and reached the overhead resistance of $134.360. However, profit booking and selling just above this resistance resulted in the pair giving up a large part of its gains. The cryptocurrency should find some support at the current levels, failing which, the drop can extend to $82.489 and lower.

While the sharp up move from the lows shows buying at lower levels, the failure to hold onto the gains shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair will pick up momentum on a close (UTC time frame) above $134.360 and will weaken below $38.528. Until then, it is likely to remain range bound between these two levels.

BNB/USD

Binance coin (BNB) has been one of the strongest performers among the major coins: it has consistently made new highs and is in a strong uptrend. Riding high on its success, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is reportedly planning to offer margin trading to its clients. The exchange is also giving away $1,000 of $ONE tokens to celebrate the launch of the forthcoming token sale. How far can the rally continue? Let us find out.

The BNB/USD pair is in a strong uptrend and has picked up momentum after breaking out of previous lifetime highs. Earlier, the resistance line had acted as a major roadblock, but the bulls are currently attempting to breakout of it. If successful, the rally can extend to $40 and above it to $46.1645899, which is a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.

But the rally is getting vertical and the RSI on the weekly charts is threatening to enter deeply overbought territory. This shows that the up move has been overdone in the short-term, and that a minor correction or consolidation can start between $40 and $46.1645899.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) is benefitting from the positive sentiment in the crypto space, and the forthcoming halving has added to the bullishness. A series of tweets by OKEx pointing to some kind of an announcement regarding Litecoin has also heightened interests. Can the upward move continue?

The LTC/USD pair has completed a cup and handle reversal pattern that has a minimum target objective of $158.81. If the momentum continues, the upward move can extend to $172.647. The moving averages completed a bullish crossover a couple of weeks back and the 20-week EMA is sloping up: this shows that the bulls have the upper hand.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain the breakout and dips below the support of $91 once again. The support levels to watch on the downside are $84.3439, $74.6054 and below it to $60.1980.

BCH/USD

Two miners who control about 43% of the bitcoin cash (BCH) mining pool, BTC.top and BTC.com, joined hands this week and executed a 51% attack to stop an unknown miner from taking coins that were accidentally sent to “anyone can spend” addresses. In this case, the attackers did not carry out the 51% attack for their own benefit, but still some believe that it shows that the cryptocurrency is too centralized. How does its chart look?

The BCH/USD pair is currently rising inside an ascending channel. It has crossed above both the moving averages, which is a positive sign. The bulls are facing selling at the resistance line of the channel, but the positive thing is that the pair has not given up ground. If the price holds above the 50-week SMA, we should see another attempt to breakout of the channel. If successful, a rally to $620 is probable.

On the contrary, if the bulls fail to scale the resistance line of the channel, the digital currency can dip to the support line of the channel, closer to $300. A breakdown of this support will break the trend.

DASH/USD

Dash (DASH) released its latest version 0.14 on the mainnet, which is another step leading to version 1.0, dubbed evolution. The upgrade improves the security of the network against 51% mining attacks, the first for proof-of-work networks, according to Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor. An analysis by Cryptoslate shows that DASH has seen a growth of 58% in the active address count from 2018 to 2019, the largest growth among the major coins. This was reportedly mainly due to the surge in usage in crisis-hit Venezuela.

The DASH/USD pair has been facing resistance at $176.81 since the past week, and a breakout of this barrier will propel the pair to the next level of $229.24. We expect the bulls to again face selling at these levels. Currently, both the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are at an advantage.

However, if the digital currency turns down from $176.81, it might enter into a consolidation. The support of the range will be at $107.36, and a break of this support will be a bearish sign.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-italy-institutions-politics-business-and-society,"Between May 23 and 26, 2019, the European Union’s citizens are renewing their continental parliament. Among the countries that will participate in the poles is Italy (voting on May 26) — one of the founding members of the EU, alongside France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. Due to the very nature of cryptocurrencies, it's tough to get a correct figure of the actual penetration of these technologies in a single country. However, relying on some proxies — as in the chart below — it is likely that the Bel Paese (the Beautiful Country) would fall outside the leading European group. Yet, since a couple of years ago, crypto and blockchain have become relevant topics for Italian institutions, political movements, business world and public opinion. This interest has been raised during the last few months, and it's very likely that these issues will become more and more relevant during the weeks immediately after the European elections, when some significant novelties are scheduled.

Unknown by the law

No specific regulation prevents Italian citizens from owning, buying or selling, or using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. However, cryptocurrencies are still a somewhat mysterious entity for Italian legislation and fiscal practice.

The Italian central bank, Banca d'Italia (the Bank of Italy), issued a first warning about “virtual currencies” at the beginning of 2015, defining them as “digital representations of a value [...] created by private subjects who operate on the Web.” The risks that the bank pinpointed, for instance, included: the lack of information about these tools, the absence of any specific regulation, surveillance or guarantee, high volatility, and the possibility to be involved in illicit activities (such as international terror or money laundering).

Besides these, Banca d'Italia underlined that the tax authorities didn't recognize the specific nature of the digital currencies, creating serious concerns about the perspectives that were open to the owners.

Agenzia delle Entrate, the Italian agency in charge of interpreting and applying tax regulation, tackles the topic only in two of its documents. First, in September 2016, the agency stated that companies offering professional services trading fiat versus crypto (and vice versa) could be equated, for fiscal purposes, with subjects trading among different traditional currencies (the agency applied to Italy a previous judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union).

More recently, in September 2018, the tax agency presented its opinion about the fiscal nature of utility tokens issued during an initial coin offering (ICO) and equated them either to a voucher bought as an anticipation of a transaction involving actual goods or services (if purchased by the public) or to a payment in nature (if they intended to be employed as a form of retribution).

Besides these statements, the fiscal nature of cryptocurrencies remains — for the Italian authorities — uncharted territory: Only hypotheses are allowed, for instance, about a natural person’s income coming from mining and even from capital gains (some commentators assimilate the latter to the “different incomes,” as defined by article 67 of the Presidential Decree 22/12/1986 no. 917).

The very legal nature of cryptocurrencies remains blurred, as the only explicit mention to them in the Italian statutory body at the moment is among the preliminary definitions of the Decree 25/05/2017 no. 90, which accepts into the Italian regulatory framework some norms about money laundering established by the EU in 2015. This decree describes ""virtual currencies"" as ""a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank or a public authority, not necessarily related to a fiat currency, used as a tool of exchange for purchasing goods or services, and electronically transferred, stored and traded.""

The decree also established the obligation for all service providers related to the use of digital currency to report their activities in a special section of the registry already set for traditional currencies exchanges (a somewhat controversial issue, as previously reported by Cointelegraph). As a matter of fact, Italian experts of juridical and tax issues are still debating if regulation should better frame cryptocurrencies as actual money (like currencies), as investment tools, as goods or as digital documents.

The watchdogs

In December 2017, consumer association Codacons presented a petition to 104 public prosecutor offices all over Italy, asking them to investigate bitcoin (BTC) and blaming the ""new currency"" as possible fraud. Therefore, the association asked the judiciary to ""identify everyone who issued BTCs on the national territory"" and to persecute unregulated trading services and online scam schemes based in Italy. Alongside underlining the lack of basic knowledge about cryptos — which is widespread in the Italian public opinion — Codacons’ initiative pointed out another relevant issue: As a matter of fact, due to the lack of specific regulation, the Italian authorities can't help but deal with cryptocurrencies using their traditional frameworks or interpreting it according to European resolutions.

At the beginning of 2019, for instance, the bankruptcy division of the Court of Florence was able to settle the complicated case of the BitGrail hack by seizing the personal assets of its founder and refunding the customers of the exchange from which hackers stole $187 million worth of Nanos in February 2018.

On the regulatory side, Banca d'Italia is the supreme regulatory body and guarantor of the Italian banking system, without any function as an issuing bank (the same as other national central banks in the eurozone). Until now, the central bank mirrored the same concerns of other similar European bodies, and it is therefore difficult to read some declarations about central bank issued digital currencies given by its deputy governor, Fabio Panetta, during a conference in Milan last June as a dramatic opening to cryptos.

Besides, Italy has an independent authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market since 1974 — the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (CONSOB). The fundamental law that governs the Italian financial markets is the Testo unico in materia di intermediazione finanziaria (TUF) — literally, the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediary — which was promulgated on Feb. 22, 1998 (Decree Law No. 58).

Based on this, CONSOB has been very active during the past months, hitting businesses promoting crypto-based financial products and services that fall outside the regulatory framework of the TUF, which is aimed at providing Italian investors with adequate information and guarantees.

In November 2018, for instance, the authority targeted Richmond Investing, Crypton Ltd., Eagle Bit Trade and an Italian representative of Cryptoforce Ltd. During the following month, CONSOB issued a warning or suspended the activities of other crypto-related businesses — including OriginalCrypto, Bitsurge Token, Green Energy Certificates, Avacrypto and the ICO Togacoin.

The authority is, nevertheless, quite conscious of the inadequacy of its traditional tools in dealing with the new business models and the means of the crypto economy, especially with ICOs. The designation of Paolo Savona as the new CONSOB president — a process that triggered quite a harsh confrontation between the political fronts — gave a considerable boost to the debate within the agency. Indeed, despite his age — the economist and former minister is 83 years old — Savona stated his interest in frontier technologies, even before his appointment in March 2019.

On March 19, CONSOB announced its commitment to an open debate to establish the pillars for new regulation explicitly designed for ICOs. The freshly appointed Commissioner Paolo Ciocca declared to the local journal Repubblica that CONSOB aims to put an end to phenomena where “pathology is overcoming physiology,” setting, in the meantime, the premises to achieve new forms of regulation. Therefore, CONSOB published a 15-page document on its website (available also in English) that summarizes the “state of the art” of the debate about cryptos, ICOs and blockchain, presenting 15 operative questions to gather opinions from the experts. The agency was collecting comments on the document by mail or through an online form (in Italian only) until May 19.

The central institutions: a new perspective?

The previous government, led by Paolo Gentiloni (from the leftist-moderate Democratic Party, PD), promoted a comprehensive national plan to boost investments in new digital technologies (under the label of Piano Impresa 4.0, Industry 4.0). However, blockchain entered in the Italian political agenda — and jargon — only after March 2018’s general election, which brought to power a coalition between Movimento 5 Stelle (5-Star Movement) and Lega Nord (Northern League).

Last September, Italy joined the European Blockchain Partnership, a new entity promoted by European Commission five months earlier as a ""vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide [blockchain] applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.”

Some months after, in December 2018, Italy was among the seven southern EU member states that supported a Malta-promoted declaration calling for help in the promotion of distributed ledger technology’s (DLT) use in the region.

During the same span of months, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development Luigi Di Maio (from the 5-Star Movement) announced the creation of a think tank of experts in charge of providing advice about emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain. The 30-member group on blockchain gathered for the first time on Jan. 21, 2019, and had other meetings during the following months based on a wide-ranging agenda. Their assignment is to present, by June 2019, an analysis of the present situation and to suggest suitable strategies to apply DLT to the industries and sectors that could gain more advantages from them. The ambition of the group is that Italy could design a formula that could also be disseminated among other European countries.

In the opinion of Vincenzo Di Nicola, one of the Ministry's advisors and co-founder of the Conio on-chain wallet, Italy should avoid a late start, as has previously happened in the history of the country:

""I'm glad that Italy is waking up and that the country is giving attention to new technologies which could have a deep impact on its economy. In the past, unfortunately, we didn't notice waves such as e-commerce or sharing economy. The result? They crushed us, and foreign companies seized the new markets. My personal hope is that, at last, this group would set the first step to sustain the creation of Italian businesses, which could then become leaders in the blockchain industry.""

The advisory group just met at the beginning of the year; therefore, it is difficult to recognize a strong correlation between its work and the proposals about blockchain’s definition, which were under debate at the Senato (the Italian upper house of parliament) since Jan. 23. The amendment to the broader decree on ""Simplification"" (Delegated Decree Law no. 989) aims to introduce legal force to the documents recorded via blockchain or smart contract, and it has been officially part of the Italian statutory body since February 2019. The actual technical standards required to match this legal requirement, however, should be unveiled by the Agency for the Italian Digitalization by the beginning of next May.

Blockchain goes local

Not only central institutions but also local authorities seem more and more involved in the debate about blockchain. Some initiatives are, as a matter of fact, more colourful than disruptive. It is difficult, for instance, to measure the actual impact of the council-run cryptocurrency AHU!, which was announced by Luigi Lucchi, the mayor of Berceto, in January 2018.

Berceto, a 2,000-person town in the Apennine Mountains, which has a twinning with the Lakota nation (another campaign promoted by Lucchi), aims to use AHU! to free its local economy from the so-called “tyranny of the euro” — however, no information about the roadmap of the project is presently available on the city council’s official website.

On a completely different scale, the city of Turin (led by the 5-Star Movement since 2016) is investigating the possibilities of blockchain since 2017 and, as a winner of the contest promoted by the EU Urban Innovative Actions Initiative, is developing Co-City, a project for collaborative management of urban commons to counteract poverty and socio-spatial polarization.

Even if the communication material produced by the project hardly mentions blockchain, Co-City has a partnership with the University of Turin Blockchain Initiative. This interdisciplinary research group is working to develop a sort of ""local-based circular economy,"" in which the citizens that collaborate to the reuse of urban commons could be rewarded by obtaining credits in cryptocurrencies that the local business activities involved in the initiative would accept as payment.

Even more ambitious is the commitment of the city council of Naples, which Mayor Luigi De Magistris (who created his own neo-leftist movement in 2015, Democracy and Autonomy) made public during the spring of 2018 and which was already reported in his interview with Cointelegraph last June.

During the past 12 months, a focus group of about 300 volunteers held regular meetings, discussing proposals and converting them in pilot applications. The issues under debate span from the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the shops of the city to their use for payments due to the city administration, considering even the ""tokenization"" of some services provided by the city council (e.g., school canteen vouchers, school book vouchers, ect.). Some topics have stronger political implications, such as the creation of blockchain-based electoral processes or the development of a complementary currency for the city, fostering a more substantial local autonomy.

This latter topic is not new for Naples, as the council led by De Magistris (during his first term) already promoted the napo, a sort of discount banknote (on paper) that should side with euros for payments in shops joining the project. Napo had short life between 2012 and 2015, as the Neapolitan shop-owners seldom accepted it.

Blockchain for democracy

It is hard to recognize if and how the different and often quarrelsome Italian political parties have different attitudes about issues such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain (or if they have an attitude at all). At the moment, they unveiled few or no specific points of their programs for the European Parliament election, and none of them involving the aforementioned topics.

Besides, very few were in the programs for the last elections in the spring of 2018. A mention to fintech — without further definition — was, for instance, included in the PD’s program for 2018’s general election (on page 12). At the other side of the political spectrum, Northern League’s 2018 program encompassed a chapter about “Digital Evolution” (page 67), which contains some general remarks about the need for Italy to oppose the overwhelming power of “Over The Top IT tycoons” (i.e., Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft) and no mentions of DLT.

Forza Italia (FI) — another party on moderate-right positions — expressed some interest for blockchain just after the last general election, when Ezio Luigi Fabiani, coordinator of the FI clubs set in the United Kingdom, officially endorsed the project Multiversum as a possible tool to improve the voting procedure of Italian citizens living abroad. After collecting more than $21 million during its ICO, from May to June 2018, this project for a new generation blockchain encountered severe difficulties to move on to an operational stage, and no recent information about a possible collaboration between Multiversum and FI is presently available.

Blockchain, however, seems to pique the interest of the Italian political parties, also referring to their inner workings and procedures.

The 5-Star Movement, for instance, appears as the more active in experimenting with the possibilities of information technology as a tool to achieve forms of direct democracy. The party was created in 2009 by former comedian Beppe Grillo and by web entrepreneur Gianroberto Casaleggio around Grillo's website. Thanks to Casaleggio's advice, the 5-Star Movement gathered its supporters and selected its candidates and program mostly through online tools, not without exciting sharp criticism among competitors about the efficiency and transparency of these means.

Last March, Davide Casaleggio — Gianroberto’s son, presently leading Casaleggio Associated and the figurehead of the movement — announced a shift toward the Rousseau blockchain, the online platform currently used to connect 5-Star Movement supporters among themselves and with their representatives in the parliament.

Casaleggio told Cointelegraph that this choice was aimed to achieve a higher level of ""security, certification and stability in the voting procedure,"" which blockchain could assure. Besides, an application involving democracy should guarantee complete anonymity of every vote/transaction — maintaining, nevertheless, the possibility to certify the subjects having actual voting rights and preventing multiple voting.

The 5-Star Movement held a test during its last gathering in Milan, relying on a clone of the Monero private blockchain, which the participants could access using an Android wallet (the controversial issue under scrutiny was the menu at the end of the meeting, with Margherita pizza being democratically elected).

The results of the test had been encouraging, Casaleggio explained — however some relevant issues lay ahead, such as the right mix between blockchain's wide distribution (meaning some kind of incentive for the participation of independent nodes) and the need to guarantee a free-of-charge vote, quite hard to achieve in a genuinely permissionless network (in this case, free tokens were distributed just before the poll).

The 5-Star Movement’s experiment didn't fail to raise some political controversy: Among its strongest critics is PD’s Member of Parliament Francesco Boccia, who has been interested in the application of digital innovation to democracy since 2012. In December 2018, Boccia promoted a workshop in Rome to demonstrate the pitfalls of Rousseau (the pre-blockchain version) and to present his proposal for an alternative platform that a group of developers was already working on called Hackitaly, which is based on the web-based framework Laravel.

The aim of the project — Boccia told Cointelegraph — is to create an open-source tool that the PD could deliberate to adopt in the short term and that, in the future, would also be offered to other political parties (even to the competitors). Hackitaly will incorporate blockchain as a means of secure voting — however, the PD's group subordinates choice among the different technical solutions under study to more general issues. Boccia added:

""Personally, I'd incline for a truly distributed, permissionless solution; however, I could not be sure that this would be realistic. Adopting the perspective of the State, a permissioned option seems more feasible, but this should meet a set of rules about digital voting — for instance how to guarantee fair and independent validators also in a 'private' network — which, presently, does not exist in Italy. We are building an instrument that is open to everybody, but we need rules equal for everybody.""

No country for ICOs

Italy is far from being among the countries hosting the highest numbers of ICOs, such as the United States, Singapore, the U.K. or Russia. According to ICObench database, which has systematically collected data about ICOs since the summer of 2015, at the end of 2017, only three projects had set their headquarters in Italy, and they gathered about $860,000 on the whole (in the same period, 142 ICOs incorporated in the U.S., raising about $6.1 billion). During the following year, the number of ICOs based in Italy and the capital collected by them rose dramatically — however, at a slower pace compared with other countries. According to the most recent data available, 40 ICOs set their home in Italy as of now, yet considering the international ranking by funds gathered, the country slid from the 49th position at the end of 2017 to the 71th in March 2019 (by the way, ICOs in Italy raised up to $7.6 million, while the U.S. reached $7.4 billion).

Among the “larger” projects setting their headquarters in Italy, only two reached or overcame the aim of $1 million. However, the amount actual gathered was very far from the maximum threshold these ICOs set (Local World Forwarders collected 47% of the envisaged hard cap, while Namacoin fulfilled only 5%).

By the way, the picture of the “Italian” ICOs would be seriously distorted if it did not consider projects that are de facto Italian, even if they appear to be labelled otherwise in the official documents and statistics. Is this the case, for instance, of the ICOs whose totality or vast majority of the founders, top management and developers are Italian citizens and that nevertheless set their headquarters in countries that offered a business or taxation environment more favorable than Italy.

Switzerland, which shares its southern border with the most economically active Italian regions — and where 8% of the population speaks Italian — seems to be an especially attractive harbor for the Italian crypto entrepreneurs who could find here lighter bureaucratic procedures, straightforward taxation and a regulatory framework already taking into account the needs of crypto businesses.

Among the ICOs starting from ingenious Italians and making landfall abroad, some were able to gather an outstanding amount of resources. It is almost impossible, on the other hand, to produce a census of the managers and developers born or trained in Italy who occupy important positions inside international projects. Some notable Italians, for instance, include Alessandro Chiesa, co-founder of Zcash, and Simone Giacomelli, business developer at SingularityNet.

Businesses: playing safe with the blockchain

After last autumn’s severe drop in the market, words such as “cryptocurrencies” or “ICO” have lost most of their glamor in Italy’s public opinion. “Blockchain” is still a buzzword in the Italian media; however, the business world seems interested in finding a way to take only the “positive” elements of this technology (e.g., blockchain as a tool of data recording), putting aside the “negative” ones (e.g., cryptocurrencies). Companies and business associations are therefore quite kin to look with more interest to permissioned platforms rather than to explore the potential of a freely distributed ledger. By the way, it is not easy to measure the readiness of the Italian business world to the innovations introduced by blockchain, taking into account that only a few projects are already achieving some actual results.

Fintech appears to be the field of application closest at hand, with a strong preference among the major players for solutions based on decentralized rather than distributed blockchains.

In June 2018, for instance, 14 members of the Italian Banks Association (ABI) began to test the possibility of a blockchain-based interbank system based on Corda’s R3, which was developed by the ABI Lab innovation center. The latest news available about the project (from February 2019) states that the application for interbank reconciliations, labelled the Spunta Project, now involves 78% of the Italian banking sector and that it's entering into a preproduction test phase. Notably, one of the largest Italian banks, Unicredit — which was also among Ripple’s supporters — didn't join the national project and completed its first transaction via blockchain in August 2018, relying on the platform We.Trade.

The leading Italian power provider, Enel (formerly a state-owned monopoly), started a working group to explore the potential of blockchain in 2016, and from the spring of 2017, the Italian company has been among the partners of Enerchain, a project promoted by the German IT service provider Ponton to experiment with the possibility of blockchain-based energy trading among utilities. It is, however, difficult to retrieve information about the present development stage of the project; besides, some relatively recent statements made by Enel’s head of business development, Giovanni Vattani, stressed the interest of the company in blockchain as a tool for improving final customer payment or refund. For this reason, Enel partnered with Polytechnic of Milan and the consultancy Reply for a research project aiming to create a European Central Bank-issued cryptocurrency.

The interest of many companies are still in an exploratory stage, rather than aiming to already have a defined application. For instance, in January 2019, the Italian postal service provider, Poste Italiane, joined the Hyperledger Fabric community, intending to gather new competencies in a field that the company feels as relevant for future innovation.

In other cases, the commitment to the blockchain revolution seems to be fostered mostly by communication goals: In these cases, the path from announcement to development of the projects seems deeply affected by the volatility of the public’s interest in cryptos and blockchain — which is, in turn, affected by the volatility of the crypto market. It is unclear, for instance, if the soccer team Juventus, which announced its Official Fan Token last fall, met its roadmap (the token should have been activated during Q1 2019), as the company in charge of its development, Socios.com, doesn't offer information or any means of contact through its website.

Alongside projects involving large companies such as the ones above, DLT could benefit Small Medium Enterprises (SME), which are the backbone of the Made-in-Italy sector. Some commentators, for instance, stress that blockchain would be a useful tool in the protection of industries such as fashion, providing opportunities for better detection of counterfeit or fake goods and enhancing customer affiliation.

The most famous Italian brands have yet to announce any critical projects — however, a test concerning traceability in the textile sector was launched by the Ministry of Economic Development in mid-March 2019, thanks to a partnership with IBM.

The crypto people

Even if a large part of the Italian population is still ignoring what cryptos and DLT are — or know them only for their pathological distortions — the Italian crypto community is quite a thriving reality. However, the actual dimensions of the phenomenon are quite hard to measure.

On Feb. 9, 2017, Cointelegraph launched its Italian version with the aim of publishing translated articles from the international edition as well as specific local content.

The forum Bitcointalk posted the first message on the local Italian board on April 2013, and since then, the Italian community has grown steadily: Six years after the first message by moderator HostFat, who is still in charge of the board, the posts in Italian are more than 258,000, on almost 16,000 topics. The Italian community, then, is among the top-10 most active local boards (ranking sixth) and second, after the German one, among the European boards.

Telegram is another medium that the Italian crypto community extensively uses: Italians are — of course — widely present in the international crypto-themed channels, but they also gather in a bunch of Italian-language chats, sometimes structured with a main chat and a cluster of child chats on specific topics. The subjects and features are pretty varied: Some groups are more focused on trading, others on ICOs and new projects. They are always run on a voluntary basis, however, with some having rather “professional” outcomes, such as the participation in ICOs on preferential terms or even bonds with market signal services.

The founders and coordinators of these channels often conceal their identity under their chat’s usernames, which are, however, quite transparent for the insiders of the community.

Contrary to the general propensity for digital anonymity, the channel Crypto Bar promotes live meetings and a face-to-face relationships among its members. Silvia Jones, founder of the group alongside Fa Busheri and MM, described the multiple faces of the Italian crypto-enthusiasts:

""The members of our community are a very heterogeneous group which spans from the housewife to the entrepreneur, from the salesman to the student or the lawyer. The age too could vary from 18 to 65. In spite of these differences, all of them have the basis for expressing their opinion and for debating it, bringing value to our channel, which aims to give an adequate cultural perspective, information and the basis for a sound analysis.""

The number of members in the Italian channels presents volatility that mirrors the crypto market. As of press time, taking into account multiple subscriptions (it's considered to be an act of politeness to participate in the channels of the “competitors”) and fake or inactive members, it is likely to estimate the aggregated dimension of these communities in about 2,000-3,000 people. That is a smaller group, if compared with the months of the ICO hype. However, it is a living and more competent community, at least in the opinion of the Crypto Dave, creator of one of the oldest channels, CoinUp! (previously Ico & Co), which managed about 40 subchannels during the bullish phase of the market:

""The Italian ‘crypto-people' had changed for better because they became more conscious. Who survived the ‘winter' are people who understood what cryptos could offer as an alternative model of the economy, in spite of the losses they endured because of projects which didn't take off. Who didn't run away is, indeed, the Darwinian evolution of 2017's investors: people who had become more knowledgeable, more committed and less inclined to fall victim of easy gains' fascination.""

Please, no more white elephants

The debate about cryptos in Italy mirrors the best and the worst in the country. Italians are renowned in the world for being creative and ingenious people. The country has, however, strong resistance to novelties (the internet, for instance, spread very slowly in Italy). In addition, new businesses face many difficulties: An analysis produced by the Harvard Business School stated that startups set in Italy, for instance, could gather less than 1/10 of venture investments that are available, on average, inside the EU (only Romania and Greece are in a worse position).

Also, other problems for the healthy development of the industries based on DLT come from the bureaucratic and business culture of the country: Italy has, in fact, quite a strong tradition in building white elephants, both considering its public sector and some private companies. The landscape of the country risks then being plagued by half-unfinished highways, empty hospitals, unused exhibition centers and obsolete industrial plants, which the local politicians or business associations infallibly announced as a game changer at every opening ceremony.

On top of this, the lack of a systemic and long-term approach hindered the development of innovations for which connectivity and compatibility are crucial. This was the case, for instance, of the first wave of the spread of IT during the 1970-80s: Many small Italian companies were proud at that time to implement an IBM-compatible system, despite the almost complete lack of suitable business applications (regarding applications in the Italian language, the void was absolute). As a result, many brilliant, young software engineers gave birth to a plethora of small and micro IT-boutiques, which tailored specific tools, different for each company and lacking any shared standards. The consequences of this fragmentation affected the national system during the successive waves of IT innovation, both considering learning processes and implementation aspects. Public intervention hardly eased the process of technology appropriation: Even more recently, the effort to bring Italy to the digital era produced “Italian-only” oddities such as the Italian certificated mail protocol (known in Italy as PEC), as a substitute to a suitable digital signature procedure.

To prevent blockchain sectors from retracing the same steps, Italy needs to approach these new technologies with an open-minded attitude, and some signals allow for the hope of a change in perspective. Davide Casaleggio, for instance, underlined that:

""Italian politics noticed quite late the underway revolution. During the first half of 2018, four Italian companies gathered through their ICOs more than the whole domestic venture capital market. Although, all of them were forced to incorporate abroad because the Italian system was not ready. Market understood blockchain more than politics; however, during the last months, some big changes happened. The legal recognition of smart contracts seems to be a small thing, but it is an important step in a new direction.""

A new regulatory framework or an incentivization scheme, however, would not be enough without an active intervention on the key driver of innovation — i.e., people. According to Di Nicola:",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bch-may-have-sustained-13-million-double-spend-bitmex-research,"Following its hard fork on May 15, bitcoin cash (BCH) appears to have experienced a two-block chain reorganization resulting in a 3,392 BCH (about $1.35 million at press time) double spend. The claim was made in a report released by the research arm of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMex on May 24.

Per the report, the recent BCH hard fork experienced three interrelated issues. Firstly, an apparent bug evidently exploited by an attacker right after the hard fork. The attacker was able to “broadcast transactions which met the mempool validity conditions but failed the consensus checks.” Miners attempting to produce blocks with said transactions were not able to, instead producing empty blocks.

The empty blocks reportedly resulted in concern among miners who “may have tried to mine on the original non-hardfork chain, causing a consensus chainsplit.”

The third interrelated problem was that the consensus chainsplit reportedly prevented a system meant to recover funds accidentally sent to SegWit addresses from functioning. According to BitMex Research, “[t]his failure may have resulted in a deliberate and coordinated 2 block chain re-organisation.”

The report claims:

“Based on our calculations, around 3,392 BCH may have been successfully double spent in an orchestrated transaction reversal. However, the only victim with respect to these double spent coins could have been the original ‘thief.’”

As BitMex Research reports, the above three issues during the hard fork resulted in 25 transactions (moving 3,392 BCH) not being included in the reorganized chain, which constitutes a double spend.

As Cointelegraph reported at the time, the bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain — the result of a previous BCH hard fork — struggled with its large block size following a series of block reorganizations in April.

In January, a deep reorganization of the ethereum classic (ETC) blockchain, which reportedly included double spending, involved more than $1.1 million worth of crypto.",,,,,,,

Even controversial cryptocurrency Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BitcoinSV) pumped more than 60 percent last week, but boutique analysis firm Delphi Digital reports it’s still one of the worst performers year-to-date.

“Historically higher beta names like LTC and BCH outperformed, as some alternative crypto assets played a bit of catch up to Bitcoin,” reads Delphi Digital’s latest market commentary. “Return dispersion was a bit more widespread, while a few of last week’s winners (NEM, XLM, ADA) ended last week in negative territory.”

Data courtesy of Delphi Digital

Indeed, cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalizations have performed the best. If you bought Bitcoin (BTC) in January and held until now, you could have doubled your money (at least).

Consider BNB, though, which increased in value by more than 30 percent last week. So far in 2019, its value has risen dramatically by almost 450 percent.

Data courtesy of Delphi Digital

Sadly, the same can’t be said for Ripple (XRP), the third largest digital asset by market cap, which has recorded only a 9-percent jump in price (based on data up to May 24).

BitcoinSV has also posted pretty measly returns, having increased roughly 16 percent in 2019. BCH, the other fork from the wasteful Hash Wars, is up at least 170 percent.

Bitcoin returns yearly profit all the damn time

It should be said that Bitcoin has steadily delivered positive year-on-year returns since 2013.

Delphi Digital’s data shows the median return for holding Bitcoin over 12 months sits at 160 percent, and median returns for six months are almost 47 percent.

“Similar claims can be made for shorter time horizons as well, though the percentage of time Bitcoin spends in positive territory decreases the shorter the period we examine,” said Delphi Digital.

“Logically, this makes sense as BTC is still considered to be a relatively volatile asset, but it’s worth noting to emphasize the importance of having a longer-term time horizon in this market,” it concluded.",2019-05-27,https://news.bitcoin.com/china-releases-new-crypto-rankings/,"China Releases New Crypto Rankings

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has released its latest rankings of 35 crypto projects that were evaluated over the past two months. While several top positions remain unchanged, Bitcoin has climbed up the overall ranking.

New Rankings From China

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released the 12th update of its crypto project rankings Thursday. The number of projects evaluated was unchanged from the previous rankings published in March. The center also announced that starting this month the rankings will be adjusted every two months instead of monthly.

In addition to the overall ranking, the CCID published three others based on basic technology, applicability, and creativity sub-categories. EOS tops the list overall, followed by Tron, and Ethereum. The center started ranking Tron in February, debuting at number two overall and has remained at that position ever since. BTC now ranks 12th, up three places from the 15th place in the previous ranking. BCH has also improved, currently occupying the 29th spot overall, up from the 31st place previously.

“The results show that the world’s three major Dapp platforms — EOS, Tron, and Ethereum — remain ranked in the top three, [and] the scores are 148.5, 144.1 and 136.6,” the CCID wrote.

The center describes itself as “a first-class scientific research institution directly under the administration of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China.” The first crypto ranking was released in May last year. The assessment is carried out by the CCID (Qingdao) blockchain research institute, an entity established by the CCID, in collaboration with multiple organizations such as the CCID think tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the center previously explained.

Sub-Rankings

The overall ranking is based on the total index scores of 35 crypto projects. The total index of each crypto project is the weighted average of its three sub-indices: the basic technology index, the applicability index, and the creativity index. The basic technology sub-index accounts for 64% of the total index, while the applicability sub-index accounts for 20% and the creativity index 16%.

“The basic technology sub-index mainly assesses the level of technical realization of the public chain,” the center described, adding that the key areas evaluated under this category “include the function, performance, safety and decentralization of the public chain.” The top five crypto projects in this category are EOS, Tron, Steem, Bitshares, and Gxchain.

The creativity sub-index “focuses on continuous innovation in the public chain, including developer size, code updates, and code impact,” the center detailed. In this category, the top five crypto projects are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, EOS and Tron.

The applicability sub-index “mainly evaluates the comprehensive level of public chain support for practical applications,” the center continued. “The assessment includes four aspects: node deployment, wallet application, development support and application implementation.” For this category, the top five crypto projects are Ethereum, Neo, Nebulas, Tron, and Ontology, which are unchanged from the previous ranking for this sub-category. “However, the data shows that the applicability indices of only 11 of the 35 public chains have increased, and the overall index has declined compared to the previous period,” the CCID noted.

The new platform, called Taotao, announced on Twitter Sunday that it will go live on Thursday, May 30, at midday local time.

According to the Taotao website, the exchange will be offering a mobile app alongside its online platform, and will offer trading in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) at launch.

The firm will also be making leverage available for interested traders, with three more cryptos added to the available options: XRP, litecoin (LTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).

Taotao is regulated as a virtual currency exchange business under Financial Services Agency, with its website proudly displaying the registration number 00001.

That early registration comes via the exchange’s previous FSA-licensed iteration, the BitARG exchange, in which Yahoo Japan bought a 40-percent stake last March. It was reported at the time by Nikkei Asian Review that Yahoo Japan had taken the stake with the aim of developing a new exchange platform using BitARG’s technology.

Taotao’s website indicates that Yahoo Japan does indeed hold 40 percent of the entity, via its wholly owned subsidiary Z Corporation, with CMD Lab Inc. holding the remaining 60 percent.

The website also offers users “easy registration/sign in” via Yahoo accounts.

The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has stated that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Malawi and do not represent a substitute to the Malawi kwacha (MWK), the local fiat currency of the southeast African country.

The bank has warned its citizens that the government is not planning to recognize investments in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), according to a statement from RBM Governor Dalitso Kabambe on Monday.

The official reportedly claimed that the bank has advised the public that all crypto-related activities such as purchasing, trading or using cryptocurrency as payment are made at an individual’s own risk. Kabambe stressed that there is no institution in the government that oversees crypto trading and regulates the parties involved in the industry.

In this regard, the governor named major risks associated with crypto investments, including money laundering and security breaches, as well as vulnerabilities to hacks and fraudulent activities.

Kabambe also noted that there is no crypto exchange that has been registered in the country, a fact that represents another risk factor for local people wishing to invest in crypto.

According to the report, the RBM’s official statement has followed a growing interest from the country’s residents on the matter, including the increased number of crypto-related enquiries to the bank.

On the other hand, Kabambe said that the RBM is aware of the potential of blockchain, the underlying technology of most cryptocurrencies that has particular use cases in a number of industries. He added that the bank will continue to track global developments regarding the technology, and reserves the right to review its stance and regulatory position if considers it to be necessary.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Bitcoin is back at doing what it does best, break out and rally on weekends. It again made a decisive move during the weekend and is pulling the crypto markets higher. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has topped $278 billion and is on its way to the $300 billion mark. This will signal a stupendous comeback from the lows of about $100 billion in mid-December of last year. The rally has been led by Bitcoin and a number of major altcoins have responded positively.

In terms of magnitude of the rise, if the bulls can sustain the current levels or push the prices even higher in the next couple of days, this month will be one of the best months since August 2017. When an asset class is in momentum, it is difficult to predict the end of the rally. Still, we believe that Bitcoin will face a lot of supply between the current levels and $10,000. Vertical rallies are usually unsustainable and can result in waterfall declines. Therefore, traders who still have positions should protect their positions with a suitable stop loss.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) prices surged on the weekend. With the latest push, the cryptocurrency has scaled another critical resistance of $8,496.53. It can now rally to the next overhead resistance of $10,000. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is overbought territory. This shows that the bulls are in command.

But if the bulls fail to sustain the breakout, the BTC/USD pair might drop back below the support of $8,496.53. The momentum will weaken if the bears break down of the 20-day EMA. Until then, every dip is likely to be purchased. The bears will make a comeback if the leading cryptocurrency falls below $7,413.46.

ETH/USD

Ethereum (ETH) bounced off sharply from the 20-day EMA on May 26. We like the way it has shot up. It is now on its way to challenge $290.92. If the bulls scale this level, the cryptocurrency can rally to the $300–$322 resistance zone.

Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Contrary to our assumption, if the ETH/USD pair fails to rally above $290.92, the pair might remain range bound for a few days. The trend will weaken if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support of $225.39.

XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) has bounced off the 20-day EMA. It should now attempt to reach the overhead resistance of $0.45. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the buyers propel the cryptocurrency above $0.47919, a rally to $0.60 is probable.

On the other hand, if the bulls fail to scale the overhead resistance of $0.47919, the XRP/USD pair can dip to the 20-day EMA. A breakdown of this support can plummet the price to $0.33108. For now, the stops on the long positions can be retained at $0.2750. We will soon trail the stops to $0.35.

BCH/USD

The rebound from the 20-day EMA has carried Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to the overhead resistance of $452 where it is facing some selling. A breakout of $452 can push the price to the resistance line of the ascending channel. If this is also scaled, the cryptocurrency might quickly move up to $638.99. With both the moving averages trending up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, the advantage is with the bulls.

But if the BCH/USD pair reverses direction from $452 or from the resistance line of the ascending channel, it can decline to the 20-day EMA. A breakdown of this support will indicate further weakness and can result in a fall to the support line of the channel. Currently, we do not find a reliable buy setup, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has continued to move up after breaking out of the overhead resistance on May 24. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. The target objective on the upside is $158.91.

However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to the target levels. The LTC/USD pair might halt at $127.6180. We will continue to trail the stops higher as the pair moves up. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency reverses direction and plummets below the strong support of $91. Therefore, the stops on the long positions can be kept at $80. The only red flag on the chart is the negative divergence on the RSI.

EOS/USD

EOS closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $6.8299 on May 26, which is a bullish sign. The bulls have extended the rally and have cleared the resistance line of the channel, which increases the probability of a move to $9 and above it to $9.60. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, the advantage is with the bulls.

The bulls will lose their advantage if the EOS/USD pair fails to sustain the breakout of the ascending channel. The previous resistance turned support of $6.8299 is the critical level to watch out for on the downside. A breakdown of $6.8299 can plummet the pair to the 20-day EMA, below which the bears will gain the upper hand.

BNB/USD

Though Binance Coin (BNB) broke out of the resistance line and made a new lifetime high on May 26, it could not sustain the higher levels and closed (UTC time frame) below the resistance line. Currently, the bulls are again trying to push the price above the resistance line, after which it can move up to $40 and above it to $46.1645899.

Conversely, if the bulls fail to scale the resistance line, the BNB/USD pair might correct to the 20-day EMA once again, which is likely to act as a strong support. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone, which confirms that the trend favors the bulls. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. Until then, the bulls are likely to buy the dips. We will wait for a suitable entry point to suggest a trade in it.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has been holding above the 20-day EMA for the past few days. This is a positive sign. The bulls will now try to push the price through the overhead resistance of $0.14861760. If successful, the digital currency will complete an inverted head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $0.22466773. Traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760 to buy and keep the stop loss just below $0.1150.

Our view will be negated if the XLM/USD pair fails to climb above the overhead resistance. It can, thereafter, remain range bound between $0.11507853 and $0.147620 for the next few days. The pair will turn negative if it plunges below both the moving averages.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) has held the support of the moving averages and has bounced off it. This is a positive sign. It should now attempt to ascend its overhead resistance of $0.094256. A breakout and close above this level will complete a reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.161275.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance and slides below the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to the next support of $0.057898 is probable. The 20-day EMA has gradually started to move up and the RSI is attempting to push further into the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are attempting to make a comeback. Hence, traders can keep an eye on our recommendation given in an earlier analysis.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $0.02815521 on May 26, which is a bullish sign. It should now move up to its first target objective of $0.040. Though there is a minor resistance at $0.03575668, we expect it to be crossed. As the cryptocurrency has broken out of the range after a long time, we expect the rally to surprise on the upside and reach $0.050.

After a breakout, a retest of the breakout levels is likely. The TRX/USD pair can dip back to the support of $0.02815521, which is likely to hold. The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is lose to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

However, the pair has repeatedly failed to sustain its previous breakouts. If the bears sink the cryptocurrency back into the range, it will lose momentum. Therefore, we are cautious and would like to reduce our risk. We suggest traders trail the stops on the long positions to $0.025.

Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://www.coindesk.com/the-cat-and-mouse-game-of-crypto-regulation-enters-a-new-phase,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

In the relentless cat-and-mouse game between regulators and cryptocurrency developers, the cats are about to add some serious firepower – this time in the form of a global alliance.

But if you think the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force’s forthcoming know-your-customer (KYC) compliance standards spell the end for the mice, think again. If anything, the FATF’s move, expected to be released next month, will drive developers to accelerate work on non-custodial exchanges and other tools that will make it easier for end-users to transact directly outside of regulated intermediaries.

As CoinDesk managing editor Marc Hochstein explained last week , the new rules are likely to require exchanges and other custodial entities that take custody of their customers’ cryptocurrency to obtain identifying information about both parties before allowing a transaction over their platforms.

Functioning much like the FATF’s “travel rule” for correspondent banks, the new regulatory approach would be backed by the task force member institutions’ unique powers to “graylist”– and ultimately blacklist – entire countries if they are judged to be non-compliant.

When combined with the European Union’s forthcoming AMLD5 anti-money laundering rules for cryptocurrencies, the new framework conjures up the image of an all-encompassing global system for cryptocurrency transactions in which no one user is unaccounted for.

‘Satoshi’s vision’ destroyed?

Libertarian-minded cryptocurrency believers will view this as an abominable surveillance system that contravenes the censorship-resistant principles upon which bitcoin was built.

From a practical perspective, the new rules are going to be a burdensome imposition on custody-handling exchanges. It may well spur industry consolidation as smaller players may find the compliance costs too high. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which counts regulatory agencies among its clients, argued in a submission to the FATF that the new rules are impractical and would drive more activity in cryptocurrencies into services that make it much harder for authorities to track illicit activity.

The rules could also, sadly, add to the “de-risking” problem that excludes billions of under-identified people in developing countries from the global financial system.

But all is not lost. In most countries, there is nothing illegal about holding cryptocurrency itself under your own custody. And, as was clarified in guidelines recently published by the Financial Crime Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, the world’s regulatory institutions won’t, for now at least, be imposing the same KYC requirements on providers of self-custody wallet software.

What is likely to emerge, then, in parallel to the FATF-regulated ecosystem of regulated custody-taking institutions, is an entirely separate economy of peer-to-peer exchanges among people who control their own cryptocurrency.

If you hold your coins with Coinbase, you will no longer be able to send or receive crypto to or from just any old bitcoin address if it has been through a KYC process. Once you move your funds into a non-custodial account, you’ll be free to send them to any self-custody address, but if you’ve never formally associated your identity with that address via a regulated entity, you won’t be able to transact with a Coinbase address or one administered by any other regulated custody provider.

The point, though, is that this otherwise draconian regulatory framework still leaves room for Satoshi’s vision of a peer-to-peer payments system. And with more work on technical and business model development, that system could still become sizable.

In fact, the new rules could be a catalyst for developers to more urgently tackle the core technical and logistical challenges that have limited the adoption of self-custody cryptocurrency wallets. These challenges fall under the categories of security, market coordination and fiat on-ramps, all three of which are currently showing significant progress.

Security

A key incentive for people to hold their cryptocurrency with custodial services such as Coinbase has been an unwillingness to risk either misplacing their private keys or having them stolen. Stories of hacks and loss abound and have long discouraged newbies from “being their own bank.”

In recent years, secure hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor have made it easier for people to control their assets without exposing their private keys to online hackers. But security experts claim to have found vulnerabilities. And the user experience is still far from convenient for the non-savvy.

Still, a new generation of smartphones that employ military grade security and end-to-end encryption should make it easier to securely hold cryptocurrency, locally, on a device that easily connects to the Internet for global payments. HTC led the way in this technology. Samsung is now catching up.

Phone makers are employing sophisticated, locally stored biometric proofs to indelibly tie control to a user. When combined with multi-signature technologies, human-friendly key recovery solutions such seed phrases kept with trusted associates, and a bit of education, the risk of loss can be reduced to an immaterial level.

Other changes to the ecosystem, such as decentralized insurance programs and more aggressive measures to hold phone carriers to account for “SIM swap” attacks such as the one that led Michael Terpin into a lengthy legal battle with a hacker and AT&T, will also boost confidence.

Over time, more and more people are going to feel more comfortable managing their own key custody.

Market coordination and fiat on-ramps

The next challenge is to reduce the widespread dependence on custody-based exchanges.

Cryptocurrency users need to efficiently find buyers and sellers, and until now, that has left them dependent on centralized exchanges, which are key targets of the new regulations.

The answer lies in the rapidly growing field of decentralized exchanges, where custody is retained by the investor and where technologies such as atomic swaps allow seamless peer-to-peer transfer of assets without either party being able to defraud the other.

As a nascent technology, DEXs currently struggle to attract the liquidity of the larger centralized exchanges, which makes them less attractive. But with Binance having launched a beta version, there is likely to be rapid development in this space.

Meanwhile, Boston-based startup Arwen has launched a protocol that would give investors access to the matching engines of large centralized exchanges but allows them to retain custody through a smart contract solution that locks up their coins in escrow. KuCoin has integrated a beta version of the technology into its exchange.

Even if decentralized exchanges and self-custody trading can help crypto-to-crypto transactions stay out of the regulatory net, they won’t solve the related problem of access to fiat currency. For the moment, that’s a service that has been almost solely provided by regulated, centralized exchanges.

The solution lies with the new batch of stablecoins, where dollar-pegged tokens such MakerDAO’s algorithmic solution, Dai, are competing with reserves-backed stablecoins such as those of Gemini, Paxos and a consortium led by Circle and Coinbase.

In theory, there’s nothing technical stopping these stable-value tokens from moving in and out of unidentified self-custody wallets, which offers a way around the fiat on-ramp problem by enabling access to de facto dollars, if not actual dollars. Only when users redeem them for actual greenbacks via the token-issuing companies will they drop into a regulated environment and have to identify themselves.

Facebook vs banks?

Now, all these services must be underpinned by real fiat resources, which means that stablecoin providers and DEX software providers will still need bank accounts. And given banks’ ongoing reluctance to support cryptocurrency businesses, obtaining them could be a potential obstacle to startups looking to grow of this ecosystem.

In this way, banks could continue to be the wedge with which regulators impose limits on the otherwise unregulated cryptocurrency industry.

But as I’ve argued elsewhere , banks’ growing interest in other blockchain developments, such as in making markets in tokenized equity and bond offerings, is going to induce them to support tokenized payments. This will eventually demand a more friendly approach to some of these service providers, especially stablecoins.

Most banks won’t want to cede the future of digital fiat payments to a competing bank such as JPMorgan , and they’ll be reluctant to let Facebook turn its more than 2 billion active users into an instant global payment network that bypasses banks. Ironically, that could draw them closer to rebel providers of these self-custody-enabling services.

The Tom and Jerry show will continue, in other words. Don’t change the dial.

Here are just some of the other important steps to mainstream acceptance that Bitcoin has attained:

Microsoft ❤︎ Cryptocurrency

Of course, Microsoft has long had its beady corporate eye on the crypto-space. Back in 2017, it set out an ambitious strategy to jump on the blockchain bandwagon. Most recently, this has seen it become an integral partner in several luxury brands’ move into blockchain authentication.

On a more Bitcoin-specific note, it is developing a Digital ID system on the Bitcoin blockchain and is a major investor in the Bakkt Bitcoin-futures platform.

Not forgetting that Bing is one of the market leaders when it comes to blocking cryptocurrency ads… no wait, hang on.

The Bitcoin Community Doesn’t ❤︎ Microsoft

Naturally, the cryptocurrency community has shown a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to Microsoft. After all, the company does have some previous when it comes to adopting popular ‘new’ technologies.

In general, the modus operandi has been:

Technology becomes popular

Microsoft wishes it had thought of the idea first

Microsoft tries to buy the technology, with no success

Microsoft creates its own poorly implemented version of the technology

Poorly implemented version becomes the industry standard

So you can see why folk are concerned… Still, surely Microsoft can’t mess up the simple addition of a currency symbol?

And this does mean we finally hit the big time, baby!

Cryptocurrencies have been trending upwards in price over the last few weeks, but in certain countries around the world digital assets have become far more valuable. For instance, in Argentina, the nation’s sovereign currency has lost considerable value and cryptocurrencies like BTC are seeing all-time price highs. The surge in value is not just taking place in Argentina as a few other countries suffering from hyperinflation are seeing significant demand as well.

Lots of Crypto Demand Stems from Countries Experiencing High Inflation and Currency Devaluation

Over the last week, digital currency supporters have noticed that the price of bitcoin core (BTC) and a few other popular assets have been seeing higher price gains in some markets compared with the rest of the world. The trend has been seen in countries suffering from economic distress and hyperinflation, an accelerated version of traditional inflation. Essentially the state’s currency begins to erode extremely fast and the prices of goods like food and medical supplies increase. Due to this factor, the region’s citizens usually switch to more stable foreign currencies in order to hedge against rapid inflation. Crypto supporters have been noticing this happen with digital assets and recently people have observed the high price of BTC in Argentina. Against the Argentine peso, bitcoin core’s value has spiked considerably and is even surpassing the all-time high in 2017.

Currently, the price per BTC is 390,719 pesos in Argentina and Localbitcoins trade volumes have also touched an all-time high. During the first week of May, Argentinian Localbitcoins volumes reached $13 million and trading has continued relentlessly. The Argentine peso has seen a massive decline against the U.S. dollar and the economic uncertainties stem from the country’s upcoming change in leadership. However, the same trend is taking place with a few other failing currencies too like the Venezuelan bolivar, Sudanese pound, and Turkish lira. And there are other countries like Colombia, Chile, and Russia that are seeing increased crypto volumes and more demand than usual. Further, places like Argentina and Venezuela are also seeing demand for bitcoin cash (BCH) over the last 30 days.

On Localbitcoins, the Turkish lira has seen steady volumes growing on the exchange and prices show that the value of BTC is nearing 2017 highs as well. At press time 1 BTC is around 52,577 Turkish lira and there’s been 500,000 to 750,000 in Localbitcoins volumes over the last few weeks. Throughout 2018 and 2019 the Turkish economy has seen rapid inflation and the lira has seen a decline in value against other currencies. In addition to the lira, the Sudanese pound verses BTC has also been climbing dramatically.

At the time of publication, a single BTC is 393,650 Sudanese pounds and liquidity is extremely low in the region. Venezuela is also in the same circumstances as the country’s inflation rate of 1.30 million percent as of April 2019 has wreaked havoc on the sovereign bolivar. Over the past few weeks of Localbitcoins volume data, the country continues to smash all-time records. According to current exchange rates at press time, 1 BTC is 49,117,302 bolivars. There’s been a lot of focus on Venezuela because the country has the highest inflation rate globally but there are a few other countries that are following similar paths. Alongside BTC, crypto advocates have been promoting BCH heavily in these regions as well, with lots of attention focused on Venezuela’s hardships.

Local.Bitcoin.com Launch and the Bitcoin Cash Venezuela Merchant Initiative

Bitcoin Cash supporters have been in Venezuela promoting the use of the decentralized currency regularly. At Bitcoin.com we recognize the need for people to trade fiat currencies for permissionless cryptocurrencies and that’s why we created Local.Bitcoin.com. People from all around the world can trade bitcoin cash (BCH) with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion when our noncustodial exchange Local BCH launches on June 4, 2019.

Bitcoin cash gives any global citizen the freedom to escape the erratic behavior of centralized fiat currencies. And the low transaction fees that are below one cent highlight how BCH is superior for remittances. In addition to the over-the-counter exchange coming next week, Bitcoin.com has also been pushing merchant adoption with our Bitcoin Cash Venezuela initiative. Our merchant adoption effort in the country aims to help retailers accept a new means of digital exchange and at the same time, escape the bolivar’s devaluation.

The demand for cryptocurrencies has grown quite sizable over the last decade, but in the last few years interest stemming from regions suffering from severe economic hardships has spiked considerably. There is a great need for permissionless digital assets like BCH in countries where the state-issued currencies are becoming worthless, capital controls are imposed, and sanctions from oppressive leaders make economic participation harder. It’s likely at any time global citizens who really need a reliable medium of exchange will flock to digital assets that can provide the means to fulfill their ends. Individuals need alternative forms of money and especially one that works. Interest in a cryptocurrency that can provide permissionless exchange, alongside reliability will surely surpass the speculative bunch of investors begging for institutional types to jump aboard. It is evident that citizens from Argentina, Turkey, Venezuela, and other countries are showing strong demand for permissionless assets and this will only continue to grow.

As the G20 summit approaches, member countries have been discussing how to implement the standards set by intergovernmental organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force. While there may be some challenges in complying with the standards, the European Central Bank says the risks crypto assets pose to the euro area’s financial stability are manageable.

G20 Implementing Global Standards

The G20 countries have reaffirmed their support for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as the global standard-setting body in areas such as anti-money laundering. They have also agreed to follow the FATF recommendations including those concerning crypto assets.

The FATF held its annual Private Sector Consultative Forum in Austria earlier this month with its members and over 300 representatives from the private sector participating. Members of the FATF are 36 countries and two international organizations including the European Commission. The FATF explained:

The discussions focused on the mapping of virtual asset services and business models … and on the implementation of specific FATF recommendations.

In its April report to the G20, the FATF outlined its work on crypto asset standards and promised to update its guidance “to continue assisting jurisdictions and the private sector, in implementing a risk-based approach to regulating virtual asset service providers, including their supervision and monitoring,” the report describes. “This will help countries in exercising oversight of this sector.” While emphasizing various risks such as money laundering, the FATF also recognized:

Technological innovations, including those underlying virtual assets … may deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy.

Russia Has Issues to Resolve

Among countries that have announced their plans to implement the standards set by the FATF is Russia. The country has yet to finalize the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, which President Vladimir Putin originally said must be done by July last year. Since no crypto regulation had been introduced, the Russian president signed another order for his country’s crypto regulation to be implemented by July this year.

However, another delay may also be in the cards as the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov, has revealed that “The adoption of the law on digital financial assets is ‘stuck’ because of the requirements of the FATF,” Tass reported on May 21. Speaking at the Russian Stock Market 2019 conference, he explained that the requirements will either be implemented in the law on digital financial assets or in a separate bill, elaborating:

The law on digital financial assets has been suspended … There were FATF decisions that require us to resolve issues related to bitcoins and so on.

The news outlet also reported first deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, indicating that the law on digital financial assets could be adopted in the Spring session. “The law on digital financial assets, on crowdfunding, etc., all these bills are in a fairly high degree of readiness,” she told the State Duma. “Colleagues from the State Duma committees are very helpful, we expect that these laws can be passed during the Spring session.” She further stressed that these laws “are extremely important for the country and will provide an opportunity to implement new projects.”

Japan Collaborating With Other G20 Countries

The host of the June G20 summit, Japan has been actively working on implementing global standards on crypto assets. Last week, the country’s House of Representatives passed a crypto bill with a number of required resolutions. According to Impress publication, one of them reads:

We have fully grasped the regulatory trends of G20 countries, and cooperated with each country to achieve international harmony.

In April, local media reported that the Japanese government is preparing to offer a handbook to the G20 countries to help them with their own crypto regulations. This matter will be discussed at the June summit along with a wide range of regulatory measures relating to crypto assets.

In December last year, Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), released a report stating:

To manage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets, countries should ensure that virtual asset service providers are regulated for AML/CFT purposes.

They should also be “licensed or registered and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures called for in the FATF recommendations,” the report details.

South Korea Wants Regulatory Consistency

South Korea has announced several times that it will comply with the unified crypto regulatory standards. At the FSB plenary meeting in April, the progress report to be delivered to the upcoming G20 meetings in Japan, vulnerabilities in the global financial system, and global standards of crypto regulation were discussed. “Transnational cooperation is necessary to regulate virtual currencies,” Choi Jong-ku, Chairman of the Financial Services Commission, was quoted as saying. He emphasized the importance for each country to consistently implement international standards prepared by the FATF “to minimize regulatory inconsistencies.”

Possible Challenges Ahead

Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis provided feedback to the FATF on its guidance for crypto assets in April. “FATF’s guidance, as it is currently drafted, would have profound implications for the cryptocurrency industry,” the firm wrote.

“There are clear technical obstacles that prevent cryptocurrency businesses from being able to comply with these standards,” Chainalysis detailed. Citing that “Cryptocurrencies were originally designed as a peer-to-peer financial system that has no central authority and no intermediaries,” the firm asserted that in most cases crypto exchanges “are unable to tell if a beneficiary is using another exchange or a personal wallet,” adding:

Requiring a transmission of information identifying the parties is not technically feasible.

The firm proceeded to discuss “technical opportunities,” suggesting that in order to meet the FATF’s goals, “Cryptocurrency exchanges can use the transparency of the shared ledger to form an effective risk-based approach.” They explained that it should be the job of exchanges to collect and store know your customer (KYC) information of each transaction’s originator, and clarified that “While the transactions themselves are public, exchanges should also link their customers with their specific transactions as this information is not available on the public ledger.”

Another point highlighted by the firm, which they referred to as “unintended consequences,” is that “There is no infrastructure to transmit information between cryptocurrency businesses today, and no one has the ability to change how cryptocurrency blockchains work.” The firm elaborated:

Forcing onerous investment and friction onto regulated businesses, who are critical allies to law enforcement, could reduce their prevalence, drive activity to decentralized and peer-to-peer exchanges, and lead to de-risking by financial institutions.

Chainalysis noted that “Such measures would decrease the transparency that is currently available to law enforcement.”

Manageable Financial Stability Risks

The European Central Bank (ECB) monitors crypto assets and analyzes potential implications for monetary policy and the risks they may pose on market infrastructures, payments, and the stability of the financial system. Its report published earlier this month entitled “Crypto-Assets: Implications for financial stability, monetary policy, and payments and market infrastructures” summarizes the outcome of the analysis of its Crypto Assets Task Force. The report reads:

At present, crypto-assets’ implications for and/or risks to the financial stability of the euro area, monetary policy, and payments and market infrastructures are limited or manageable.

Noting that crypto assets cannot be used to conduct money settlements in important financial market infrastructures in the EU, the bank states that “they do not qualify as securities … [and] central securities depositories (CSDs) cannot undertake settlement of crypto-assets.”

Even if crypto-based products were to be cleared by central counterparties, they would need to be authorized and to satisfy existing regulatory requirements, the bank clarified, adding that “Even at their peak in early 2018 the outstanding value of crypto-assets was too small to give rise to concerns for the EU financial system and the economy.” Stressing that “Crypto-assets market developments are dynamic and links to the financial sector and the economy may increase in the future,” the bank claims:

It is therefore important that the ECB continue to monitor the crypto-assets phenomenon, raise awareness and develop preparedness for any adverse scenarios, in cooperation with other relevant authorities.

The ECB concluded that “Financial institutions investing directly or indirectly in crypto assets should have in place relevant governance arrangements, also in line with the licensing criteria, and commensurate to the materiality of investments in crypto-assets and/or crypto-assets-related activities.” The bank added that many factors ranging from market developments to “unintended ‘legitimising’ effects” of crypto regulation could result in greater exposures to crypto assets.

The news was reported by local broadcasting station KBS World Radio on May 28.

Today’s meeting, led by the Minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, Noh Hyeong-ouk, was largely prompted by bitcoin (BTC)’s recent break above 10 million won (~$8,400), the report states. The coin last hit a similar valuation around a year ago, with local officials ostensibly interpreting the fresh surge as a sign of a possibly overheating market.

Meeting participants reportedly included officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Justice Ministry and the country’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC).

Areas of focus included a plan to closely surveil domestic crypto exchanges and to intervene in a bid to minimize ramifications for investors should the market continue to pump.

Other plans include a pledge to take robust action against any detected fraud by maintaining close coordination between law enforcement authorities and the FSC.

In addition, the meeting established the need to swiftly pass a pending revision to the country’s Financial Information Act, which would outlaw money laundering by crypto exchanges.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, research from software firm DataLight has suggested that the United States, Japan and South Korea are the world’s biggest fans of crypto exchanges.

The report further claimed that bitcoin’s recent price surge had prompted associated phenomena — notably including South Korea’s erstwhile Kimchi Premium surcharge — to reappear, with DataLight proposing the events contributed to the exchange visit rates.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-mixers-and-why-governments-may-want-to-shut-them-down,"On May 22, 2019, cryptocurrency mixers (also called tumblers) were front and center on the news cycle, following reports of European authorities shutting down one such service. Law enforcement officials involved said the action was necessitated by reports on Bestmixer.io — i.e., the platform in question that was being used to funnel dirty money via cryptocurrencies.

Stakeholders in the crypto industry decried the action, calling it a gross overreach by government agents. They also declared that it set a dangerous precedent, one that could be inimical to cryptography as a whole.

In the wake of the shutdown, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, suggested the creation of an on-chain mixing service. With the eyes of law enforcement seemingly fixed on anonymous cryptocurrency operations, a pivot toward on-chain anonymization might be the solution for those preferring to keep their cryptocurrency transactions anonymous.

Is cryptocurrency transactional anonymity a myth?

While it is common to hear phrases like “anonymous transactions” with respect to cryptocurrencies, the truth is that activities on many blockchains are more pseudonymous than anonymous. Cryptocurrency transactions proceed without the need for a third-party intermediary, and oftentimes, this feature gets conflated with actual anonymity.

In mainstream finance, if person A wishes to send funds to person B, then A has to use a service — e.g., a bank to facilitate the transaction. The identity of both participants will be known to the third-party authenticator, and it could be provided to law enforcement, tax bodies or other government agencies.

For cryptocurrency transactions, the absence of an intermediary means A and B can transact between themselves without revealing their identities. While this may seem like anonymity, it really isn’t, as their transaction is still visible to other participants with access to the blockchain.

Now, let’s imagine a spy or some other “bad actor” — who really has it in for either A or B — using careful blockchain forensics: They can follow these transactions to uncover the real-life identities of the participants. These days, public addresses belonging to cryptocurrency exchanges and other major stakeholders are known to many in the community.

This knowledge is one of the reasons why monitors can become aware of a hack even before platforms become aware of what is happening. A large transaction from a known wallet to an unknown wallet usually raises eyebrows.

There have been numerous instances when the alphanumeric cryptocurrency addresses have been linked to their owners. Back in November 2018, Cointelegraph reported on the United States Treasury Department sanctioning a couple of Iranian nationals implicated in the SamSam bitcoin ransomware scheme.

At the time, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury Department remarked that it was the first time that BTC addresses had been publicly attributed to individuals on its sanctions list.

Cryptocurrency mixers and how they work

There are, of course, cryptocurrencies that offer near-total anonymity by obscuring almost every detail of a transaction — addresses, amounts involved, etc. Monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) are popular examples of these so-called “privacy coins.”

These cryptocurrencies mostly utilize transaction mixers or high-anonymity consensus protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), to create almost total obfuscation of transaction details. Zero-knowledge proofs enable transaction verification without needing to authenticate the validity of transactional information.

Not everyone who values anonymity would necessarily want to use these privacy coins, and that is where cryptocurrency mixers come into play. These services obscure the source and destination of virtual currency transactions.

As the name implies, mixers take the target transaction and include it in a basket of other transactions of the same value. The idea is that the “mixing” of these transactions would throw off any spy trying to “follow the money.”

Tumblers aren’t only used for sending cryptocurrencies to other users, though. They can also be employed when trying to remain anonymous when receiving cryptocurrencies from platforms that utilize Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, like trading services.

For example, person C has made a total of 1 bitcoin (BTC) this past week: 0.5 BTC from trading, 0.3 BTC from her online store, and 0.2 BTC from working as a freelance writer. If C withdraws all 1 BTC to her bitcoin address, she could lose her anonymity because these transactions would be originating from platforms with robust KYC provisions.

Person C could use a cryptocurrency tumbler to mix up these transactions by adding inputs from other users. At the end of the process, C receives her 1 BTC, but the information recorded on the blockchain would be sufficiently scattered to throw off any potential spy.

Cryptocurrency mixing services employ numerous features to ensure privacy and anonymity. Users usually have to create “burner cryptocurrency addresses” (i.e., temporary wallets). These platforms do not store user information for more than 24 hours. The mixing process can last between 30 minutes and six hours. Longer time frames tend to produce more secure transactions.

While there are several cryptocurrency mixing platforms, they usually employ the same process. Users specify their target addresses for receiving the “mixed coins,” then select a convenient time frame and agree to the fee, which typically ranges from 2-5%.

In April 2019, Cointelegraph reported that mixed BTC transactions (“CoinJoins”) constituted about 4.09% of all bitcoin payments. Data from Long Hash — a blockchain analytics firm — showed that bitcoin payments via CoinJoins were up by more than 300% since August 2018.

The war against cryptographic anonymity

Privacy and anonymity aren’t usually concepts that go down well with governing bodies. Thus, it is no surprise that various jurisdictions have taken steps to curtail efforts for ensuring anonymity for cryptocurrency payments.

Countries such as France and Japan have called for privacy coins like monero and dash (DASH) to be banned. In China, blockchain companies are forbidden from designing anonymity-enhancing features, with Beijing saying such regulation is healthy for the industry in the long run.

Government officials usually put forward the same argument to justify their actions: Privacy coins enable criminals to launder money, evade taxes or sponsor terrorist organizations.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, various governments are stepping up their efforts to monitor blockchain transactions. Some of these jurisdictions are even turning to blockchain analysis specialists like Chainalysis to identify cryptocurrency hackers and tax evaders.

Now, it appears that law enforcement agencies are turning their attention toward cryptocurrency tumblers. Recently, Europol, in conjunction with Dutch and Luxembourgian authorities, shut down Bestmixer.io — one of the largest cryptocurrency mixers in the industry, with a turnover of more than $200 million since its inception back in May 2018.

According to the Europol report, the platform was involved in money laundering and several forms of illegal financing. The investigation reportedly began back in June 2018, with Europol planning to share the information gathered from the bust with several other law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions.

Once the news became public, several notable figures spoke out, including internet security guru and cryptocurrency bull John McAfee, who responded to the news via Twitter, saying:

“Bitcoin mixers are now being targeted. Anonymity itself is slowly being considered a crime. The word ‘Privacy’ will soon mean ‘Criminal Intent.’”

McAfee’s comment echoes those of many in the industry who accuse the government of conflating privacy with criminality. These critics argue that there are many noncriminal reasons why someone would wish to protect their privacy and anonymity while transacting in cryptocurrencies.

Sjors Provoost, a bitcoin developer, quipped:

Dutch law enforcement took down a mixer today and apparantly charged them with money laundering. I find this a very worrying precedent, because mixers are currently the only tool to mitigate Bitcoin's poor on chain privacy. This action puts lives at risk. https://t.co/fcxj9kMhys — Sjors Provoost (@provoost) May 22, 2019

Cryptocurrency-related robberies aren’t restricted to online hacks. There have been physical assaults on cryptocurrency owner, with some even leading to the death of the victim. From Dubai to Singapore, and even the United Kingdom, cryptocurrency owners have fallen victim to armed bandits looking to steal their valuable virtual coins.

Many government agencies around the world argue that the use of cryptocurrency-anonymizing services akin to being involved in illegal activities. In many ways, it seems to be an extension of anti-cryptocurrency rhetoric by state officials in different jurisdictions.

Cointelegraph reached out to Emin Gün Sirer associate professor of computer science at Cornell University and the co-director of the initiative for cryptocurrencies and smart contracts (IC3), to speak about the merits of such government action vis-à-vis the pervasiveness of money laundering via virtual currencies. According to the professor:

“Money laundering is a problem for all bearer assets, starting with government-issued cash. Every society on earth has decided that the benefits of cash on hand outweigh the downsides of a small percentage of money laundering transactions. And they have enacted effective means for controlling these unwanted use cases at the edges of the financial system, where the banking system meets consumers.”

Despite the continued assertion by state agents that cryptocurrencies find extensive use in criminal activities, the actual hard data available in the public domain shows the exact opposite. Earlier in the year, Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) released its 2018 money laundering report, which showed virtual currency-related money laundering at less than 2% of all recorded cases.

However, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan recently declared that it would increase its oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges to stamp out money laundering. With the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) visiting the country in the fall of 2019, Japan hopes to gain a favorable rating from the intergovernmental body.

Perhaps the FSA could focus on the other avenues on which close to 99% of all money laundering in the country happen. Cryptocurrencies certainly didn’t contribute to the country receiving the FATF’s lowest rating in terms of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and KYC compliance back in 2008.

Perhaps a pivot toward on-chain anonymization?

If governments continue to clamp down on avenues that ensure transactional anonymity, then it stands to reason that developers will create more robust platforms that will be more difficult to police. Professor Sirer made similar remarks in his correspondence with Cointelegraph, writing:

“The problem with shutting down a mixer/tumbler is that it will force the community to develop more effective tumblers and mixers that cannot be shut down or traced as easily.”

One such example could be the pivot toward on-chain anonymization. Shortly after the Bestmixer.io shutdown, Ethereum’s Buterin proposed the creation of an on-chain ether (ETH) mixer as a way of improving user privacy on the blockchain.

Buterin’s proposed ETH mixer goes beyond spreading transactions among multiple users, instead suggesting to completely obfuscate all transaction details by ensuring that they don’t appear on the blockchain. Buterin did, however, mention that such a system might only be able to handle small amounts of ETH.

When asked about the viability of on-chain mixers, Sirer opined:

“I doubt that either Bitcoin or Ethereum will add on-chain anonymity measures any time soon. Bitcoin is capacity limited and change-averse, while Ethereum is focused on building a world computer. But other coins will emerge with stronger guarantees, and there's plenty of research into bolt-on alternatives. By clamping down on a service that is easy to trace, law enforcement is setting the stage for another generation of services that they will not be able to control or corral.”

Section 10 of the bitcoin white paper, as written by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto, focuses on privacy — i.e., the limiting of personal information of transacting parties. Privacy and anonymity are arguably fundamental tenets of cryptocurrency held by many enthusiasts. It doesn’t appear to be beyond the realms of comprehension to envision that developers will create censorship-resistant platforms that allow anonymous cryptocurrency transactions — if pushed to do so.",,https://www.ft.com/content/7b823d04-809b-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849,"Become an FT subscriber to read:

Cryptocurrency companies in the United States aren’t happy. Token issuers, exchanges, and VCs are up in arms about vague and contradictory guidance on crypto asset regulation. Should the U.S. fail to revise its financial laws, they warn, there is a risk of top talent making an exodus to friendlier crypto climes.

The US Risks Being Left Behind

America is known for its forward-thinking approach to tech. As a consequence, Silicon Valley startups have been allowed to flourish in a favorable regulatory climate. Because blockchain technology intersects with money, however, innovating in the U.S. hasn’t been so straightforward. A string of regulatory agencies including the SEC and CFTC take a strict view of such matters as unlicensed money transmission and unregistered securities trading. Cryptocurrency issuers, service providers and P2P traders risk falling afoul of confusing state and federal laws, which are often enforced without rhyme nor reason. Figuring out the stance of the SEC and its cohorts is a task that’s kept even the best crypto lawyers guessing.

In a blog post on May 23, Poloniex exchange owners Circle pleaded for U.S. regulators to show sanity. The company warned of conflicting SEC policy “chilling innovation in the U.S. and nudging crypto projects toward jurisdictions with greater regulatory clarity—neither of which is good for U.S. business.” They added:

We’re frustrated by the consequences of the current guidance, and we know those sentiments are shared by the crypto community as a whole … we need … thoughtful and effective policies in the U.S. that enable creativity from technologists the world over and are built for crypto assets released on public blockchains, rather than age-old laws written for securities offered by corporations.

If the penalty for breaching securities laws was only a slap on the wrist, businesses might be more inclined to move fast and break stuff, rather than tread carefully for fear of censure. Instead, cryptocurrency exchanges have been forced to err on the side of the caution, in the knowledge that the slightest slip could see them slapped with a punitive fine or barred from trading altogether.

While America Slumbers, Other Nations Seize the Day

Confusion over what constitutes a security and whether “sufficient decentralization” makes a project’s token a utility have kept U.S. crypto leaders scratching their heads. While exchanges such as Poloniex have delisted coins like DCR and REP, due to uncertainty over their legal status, other countries have capitalized on this policy void and embraced tokenization, within certain bounds.

Jose Maria Macedo is the Head of Advisory at Amazix and a member of the San Marino Scientific Council. There he serves as a token economics expert, helping the crypto-friendly microstate develop its blockchain policy. He told news.Bitcoin.com: “The SEC finds itself in a difficult position in regulating the crypto space. One the one hand, it’s obliged to stamp out the most flagrant securities violations that have been perpetrated by ICOs, while taking a lighter touch towards tokenized projects that are acting in good faith. Unfortunately, a lack of clarity in the U.S. as to what constitutes a security token has led to exchanges self-censoring, and removing crypto assets out of fear that they may fall foul of the SEC.” He added:

If the U.S. doesn’t update its archaic financial laws to reflect the growth and innovation within the cryptoconomy, we could see a ‘brain drain’ in which the smartest token economists and developers flee to territories that have embraced crypto assets and enacted clear guidelines that let companies know ‘We’re open for business’.

In its impassioned blog post, Circle cited the Token Taxonomy Act, a bipartisan bill seeking to exclude digital tokens from security laws. The definition of what constitutes a security, based on the 1946 Howey Test, and supplemented by unofficial comments by regulators over the years, are murky at best. In “A taxonomy of token models and valuation methodologies,” Jose Maria Macedo defines crypto capital as “A token whose ownership provides ongoing access to something of value,” of which security tokens form a subset. Crypto assets, on the other hand, are “tokens whose ownership doesn’t yield an ongoing stream of value.” This interpretation sounds simple enough, but until such reasoning is enshrined in law, U.S. crypto companies are obliged to tread carefully.

Crypto Leaders Take the Fight to the SEC

Fred Wilson, CEO of Union Square Ventures, weighed in on the regulatory debate Circle sparked, criticizing the SEC’s “damaging policy” that will drive liquidity and trading volume to Asia, where the remainder of the crypto sector will follow. “In 5-10 years when we look back and consider why the next big tech sector centered itself in Asia and not in the US, it will be the SEC’s unwillingness to create new rules to regulate new assets that will be the cause,” he concluded.

On May 28, Kin founder Ted Livingstone went a step further, launching Defendcrypto.org whose mission statement reads: “The SEC has been shaping the future of crypto behind the scenes with settlements that set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation. Kin is unwilling to let that happen and is setting aside $5MM with Coinbase to take them on in court. But with the future of crypto on the line, $5MM might not be enough. That’s why we’re calling on others to contribute to the Defend Crypto fund.”

In a follow-up blog post, Fred Wilson chipped in:

It is my hope, and Kin’s hope, that DefendCrypto.org will be an inspiration for the many other important crypto projects that are silently battling with the SEC to come public and raise capital from the crypto sector for their fights. The SEC is regulating by enforcement, not new rulemaking, and worse, they have taken a divide and conquer strategy. It is time for the crypto industry to come together and fight back.

Kin is unlikely to gain much public support in taking their fight to the SEC. This is a company, after all, which raised $100M via an ICO not so long ago. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus that when it comes to crypto asset regulation, something has got to give. Otherwise, the U.S. risks falling behind to nations that aren’t afraid to embrace digital currencies. Drawing level with them again could take years.

With many questioning their legitimacy, the government-run ranking index has been met with widespread skepticism. Now, China has recently released the latest update of its cryptocurrency rankings.

China’s crypto rankings have consistently favored EOS

The Chinese rankings are supposedly based and calculated using a set of three criteria. These include technology, application, as well as innovation. Moreover, the China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) agency publishes the cryptocurrency rankings.

Furthermore, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology directly oversees the CCID. As such, some regard the Chinese cryptocurrency rankings as a list of what cryptocurrencies China’s government perceives to ”be the best”.

Image Source: CCID

This is the twelfth time China has updated its ”Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index” since launching last year. Specifically, China’s updated crypto rankings still put EOS in the top – a position it has held since June 2018.

EOS received a total index score in the rankings of 148.5. Joining EOS in the top five are, in order of ranking, TRON, Ethereum, Steem, and Ontology. These cryptocurrencies have received index scores from 144.1 down to 110.4.

Latest rankings give Bitcoin a better rating than before

China’s crypto rankings have notoriously ranked Bitcoin consistently low in this index. In March of this year, the CCID ranked Bitcoin at 15th place in its index. This comes as Bitcoin is, far and away, the most well-known and traded cryptocurrency asset on the market.

Since March, however, this premier cryptocurrency has experienced an intense rally. Just yesterday, the Bitcoin price reached a new 2019 high. Adding to this, China’s crypto rankings have also upgraded Bitcoin to the 12th place.

What’s more, Bitcoin scores exceptionally high in the ”innovation” part of the CCID’s index. However, the cryptocurrency consistently receives comparatively low scores both when it comes to ”technology” and ”application”.

Moreover, one should note that China’s crypto rankings generally favor large-capacity blockchains over proof-of-work blockchains. Although this is questionable, the CCID has stated in its May report that the criteria will remain consistent.

”The subject of this technical assessment has not changed, including 35 well-known public chains around the world. The evaluation model is consistent with the previous issue and is still evaluated in three main areas: basic technology, application, and innovation.”

Join over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ivy-league-universities-set-to-boost-the-crypto-industry-with-an-injection-of-institutional-investment,"Despite the crypto volatility, the widely publicized regulatory concerns and a lack of liquidity in the cryptocurrency market, reports show that university endowments worldwide are dipping their toes into cryptocurrencies.

Recently, a survey conducted by a trade publication in partnership with two other startups showed that up to 94% of the 150 endowments surveyed had an investment in crypto-related projects. More than 80% of those surveyed were United States-based institutions, with the rest of the respondents coming from the United Kingdom and Canada.

What is most exciting about the survey is that a whopping 54% of respondents said that they “directly invested in cryptocurrencies though the assets themselves.”

The other 46% said they gained their exposure through products offered by crypto funds.

Ivy League universities join the fray

On Oct. 10, 2018, another report published by a technology news site indicated that multiple prestigious and Ivy League universities in the U.S. had made investments in cryptocurrency funds. Although the report cited an anonymous source, it revealed that “Harvard University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of North Carolina” had all invested capital in the crypto space.

Furthermore, Yale University (another Ivy League school) was revealed to have dabbled in the crypto space with an investment that helped Paradigm (a digital currency fund) raise $400 million.

With nearly $30 billion in its endowment fund, Yale is believed to be the second-largest endowment after Harvard's $39.2 billion endowment.

A brief background of endowment funds

Even though most universities are financed by the government, educational institutions also get much of their income from the courses they teach. But, unbeknownst to most, these institutions also operate lucrative money machines in the form of endowment funds; that aim to provide supplementary income.

Endowment funds come from donations that are given to colleges and universities for the purpose of investment. The institution holds the principal of the investment in perpetuity while making annual payments of about 4-5% to the university’s annual expenditures.

With a dual goal of growing the principal as well as generating income, endowment funds have become accustomed to a strict set of guidelines. These guidelines are designed to dictate the allocation of funds. For a long time, the overall principle for most endowment funds was to yield returns while taking the least amount of risk.

That was the norm until the appointment of David Swensen over Yale’s endowment in 1985. By reducing the endowment’s commitment to U.S. stocks and bonds from 75% in 1988 to 14% in 2008, Swensen successfully managed to grow Yale’s endowment from a little over $1 billion to its current worth that is just a few points shy of the $30 billion mark.

Swensen’s success over the years sparked a revolution in the university endowments space, prompting a move from traditional stocks and bonds to the so-called “alternative assets” (investments that include natural resources, private equity and real estate). Following Swensen’s success, other endowments — such as Harvard’s — were also able to generate huge returns over the years.

The two decades leading to the financial crisis of 2008 have presented endowments good alternative assets. Subsequently, we can assume that endowment managers like Swensen have acknowledged that what worked in the past may not work in the future. Therefore, endowments have started devising new investment strategies in an effort to stay afloat.

Despite crypto winter, endowments are not walking away

Although respondents form the survey conducted by Golden Custodian acknowledge the risks that the cryptocurrency market is currently facing, only 7% of the respondents anticipate an annual decrease in the funds they have invested.

Endowments are showing strong bullish signals by factoring in crypto-related investments into their allocation, without a thought of stepping away anytime soon.

In fact, on April 11th, Bloomberg reported that Havard University’s endowment, in conjunction with other investors, has invested a cumulative of about $98.5 million into Blockstack’s token sale.

Blockstack is a crypto-based company that is seeking $50 million through its digital-token offering. The funds are set to go into enabling Blockstack to support the development of its own decentralized computing network.

According to the SEC filing for the Reg A+ offering from Blockstack, Harvard’s endowment allocation amount sits between $5 million and $10 million. These are funds invested directly into the startup’s token sale, meaning the Ivy League’s endowment is holding some of Blockstack’s tokens.

BREAKING: Harvard’s endowment invested $5M - $10M directly into Blockstack’s token sale.



This means that one of the leading university endowments is comfortable holding tokens directly.



THE VIRUS IS SPREADING 🔥 — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) April 11, 2019

Another university endowment investment in 2019 is the University of Michigan (UoM). With a $119 million endowment, this university is reportedly planning to increase its stake in an Andreessen Horowitz-managed crypto fund.

In June last year, the University of Michigan’s endowment invested $3 million to the fund. Although details about the amount were not revealed, UoM’s endowment confirmed its dedication to inject additional investment into the Andreessen Horowitz’s (also called a16z) fund dedicated to crypto.

What are the skeptics saying?

Following the move by UoM’s endowment fund, most onlookers like David Nage (a former family office investor) believe that the rationale that drives the University of Michigan’s interest in crypto is too bullish for the ecosystem. In a posted tweet, Nage mentioned:

“University of Michigan’s Endowment invested in a16z crypto back last year but has approved follow on investment recently. The rationale listed below I find interesting and bullish for the ecosystem.”

From Nage’s point of view, the huge interest in crypto-based ventures by significant endowments has validated retail investors to stay bullish despite the market experiencing the most extended bear phase.

In fact, people are beginning to wonder whether the huge interest in crypto by endowments is healthy. With Bloomberg’s Galaxy Crypto Index hitting its most overbought mark since last year, experts have started to warn that crypto prices are about to collapse once again.

As it stands, Swensen’s model of investing has become the investment yardstick for endowments to follow, but only a few schools have managed to pull off what Yale's endowment has accomplished.

According to a study conducted with a sample of over 28,000 endowment funds in the U.S., “Major endowments in the United States are [actually] underperforming.” Study says:

“The median annual return for the entire endowment sample was 3.75 percent or 1.14 percent below the 10-year treasury bond return.""

The researchers acknowledge significant exceptions such as Yale, but they still support the conclusion that college endowments are better off buying treasuries instead.

Contrary to expert opinion, however, is Anthony Pompliano, the founder of crypto fund Morgan Creek, who believes that “there’s a belief in the institutional world that if the industry will be around for a long time, it will be very valuable.” He further pointed out:

“The smart money is not distracted by price [volatility] but looks at the long-term trends, and believes they’re betting on innovation as a great way to deliver risk-mitigated returns.’’

Institutional investing meets crypto

The reality of investing in crypto is that it forces endowment investment officers to adapt to a whole new set of issues. After all, crypto bets are very different from taking equity stakes in regular startups.

While speaking to CNBC last year, Bill Barhydt, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Abra, said:

“People are excited about it but afraid of being the first, or having to explain themselves. That’s the fear vs. greed of institutional investing. There’s a herd mentality there as much as there is in retail investing.”

Indeed, compared to regular retail investors, institutional investors are not completely different. While individual retail investors will conduct due diligence before investing, these institutional investors are usually backed by large organizations that require robust conduct in each of their investments, plus a deeper level of due diligence.

That is why most onlookers believe that the confidence in crypto as shown by the world’s leading endowments might lead to increased high-profile institutional investment in the cryptocurrencies world by other institutional investors, as was the case in 2017. The only difference is that this time, it will be better controlled.

Already, the new interest in the digital coin space by endowments has brought with it a wind of moderate comeback across the crypto market. So far, ether and bitcoin have gained over 66% and 73% respectively this month alone, and XRP — the third-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap — has rallied by 48%.

An eye on the future

Apart from jumping onto the crypto bandwagon, universities and colleges have grown in their appreciation and understanding of blockchain technology as well. From MIT to Cornell and even Stanford, blockchain courses are growing in popularity everyday. All over campuses, blockchain technology is touted as the next revolution that is set to be as huge as the internet.

But, while it is easy for universities to offers courses on blockchain and crypto, what has caught many by surprise is the fact that universities are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Nothing is as powerful as showing your support for an emerging technology than with your wallet.

Granted, the investment arm of any university is typically independent of the academics, the move by endowment investors like Swensen, however, is a strong signal that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are here to stay.",

The Malta-based broker debuted its Bitcoin-only hedge fund back in 2013. At the time, cryptocurrency trading was carried out through EXANTE crypto funds, which allow buying bitcoin and 15 popular altcoins. Exante offered the Bitcoin Fund with an initial minimum subscription of $100,000 and a 0.5% fee for subscriptions and redemptions (1 Bitcoin Fund share = 1 bitcoin). There’s also a commission of a 1.75 percent annual fee (payable in bitcoin to preserve the ratio) for managing the security necessary to safeguard the private keys.

Also in 2017, Exante launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which allows clients to speculate on prices of popular alternative cryptocurrencies. XAI Fund is secured by the real cryptocurrencies included in the index, and it did not include Bitcoin into the list to make the offering more diversified.

Regulated activities

EXANTE has been one of the few brokers that jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon from the very beginning. The company started the Bitcoin fund six years ago, which allowed trading that specific cryptocurrency, then added more popular altcoins such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, and Ripple.

Finance Magnates also reported on Exante last year when its new venture capital fund ‘Exantech’ announced its first investment – $10 million in cryptocurrency miner Comino.

EXANTE is regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). The brokerage is also authorized to provide services in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Despite the considerable drop in price since the late 2017 highs, interest has not abated.

While some mom-and-pop crypto speculators undoubtedly folded up shop after the rout from over $20,000 to sub-$4,000, true believers have kept the cryptocurrency in the public eye.

Now market actors are once again scratching their heads as bitcoin continues its latest rally. With the cryptocurrency now trading close to $9,000, bullish voices have once again begun to reverberate.

Investors should approach the bitcoin rally with extreme caution. Indeed, they would perhaps be best served to take the advice of one of the all-time greats of currency trading and speculation, George Soros (Trades, Portfolio). According to “the man who broke the Bank of England,” bitcoin is pure fool’s gold.

Calling it out

Soros knows a thing or two about currencies, so it pays to listen when he speaks on the subject. When it comes to bitcoin, he has been quite unambiguous. In January 2018, he declared it wasÂ not a currency at all:

“Bitcoin is not a currency because a currency is supposed to be a stable store of value and the currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used for instance to pay wages because wages drop by 25% in a day.”

This is a vitally important point that many crypto bulls either fail to understand or choose to ignore. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be ostensibly free of the machinations of government central banks, but that does not automatically make them a “sound money” alternative to conventional currencies. Rather, bitcoin functions as a purely speculative asset class, based on no fundamentals and not subject to any underpinning value.

Calling the bubble

Soros has highlighted how the misunderstandings surrounding bitcoin’s utility as a currency - now or in the future - have served to warp its price behavior. He made this point last year as well:

“Cryptocurrency is a misnomer and is a typical bubble, which is always based on some kind of misunderstanding.”

This is a crucial point for bitcoin speculators to understand. Its valuation is tied fundamentally to speculation, not to its utility as a medium of exchange or as a store of value for ordinary citizens and market participants.

Calling it doubly right

Soros’ comments from early last year do sound somewhat prophetic. The value of bitcoin burst, as all bubbles inevitably do, falling precipitously before beginning to trade for months in a much-diminished range.The guru did one better, though, predicting that any violent fall would be arrested thanks to the bottom created by the actions of certain shady market actors:

“Normally when you have parabolic eventuality it has a very sharp break but in this case as long as you have got dictatorships on the rise you will have a different ending because the rulers in those countries are going to turn to Bitcoin to build their nest egg abroad. So I expect instead of an abrupt break to have a rather flat top over.”

While it may be too early to tell, Soros appears to have called the behavior of bitcoin post-bubble pop remarkably correctly. The initial collapse cratered the cryptocurrency, but it has enjoyed a considerable cushion of support around $4,000 from which its latest bull run has been anchored. Bitcoin has considerable utility for a subset of actors working in gray areas of business and finance, especially in the increasingly wealthy and sophisticated economies of countries with lax attitudes toward the rule or law or authoritarian systems of political and economic governance.

Calling the next move

Whenever bitcoin picks itself up off the floor, market commentators start buzzing. This time is no different. However, as Ross Chalmers of Coin Rivet recently pointed out, the retail interest that fueled the last big bubble seems to be far more muted this time around:

“Whenever Bitcoin rises in price, commentators are quick to guess what the underlying reasons are. The last time Bitcoin saw its current price, there was a massive wave of interest from the retail market. Mainstream news outlets were writing articles and everyone was talking about it...The interest from retail investors appears to be very small this time around. For the most part, Bitcoin’s recent upward move has gone under the radar outside of the crypto community.”

While the exact source of the cryptocurrency's latest bullish energy is not entirely clear, we can see some likely contributing causes. Fears over the U.S.-China trade war, as well as uncertainty surrounding Brexit, have undoubtedly helped keep interest in alternative asset classes alive. But it is interesting that retail is not the key driver as it was before. That dynamic has given some long-suffering crypto bulls cause for hope that this time might be different.

Verdict

Alas, Soros has not opined on bitcoin’s latest moves, so we cannot directly look to him for guidance. For all the changing dynamics observable in this latest crypto upswing, however, the fundamental pathologies Soros identified in 2018 have not changed appreciably.

Fundamentally, bitcoin remains a niche speculative vehicle. There is still no clear path by which it could enter a mainstream financial usage, other than in the current niches it already serves. While we may not see so violent a collapse as last time, we cannot see how this latest bull run ends with anything other than another round of disappointment for long-suffering speculators.

Crypto.com Adds Bitcoin Cash Support

Hong Kong headquartered payments and cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com announced on Wednesday May 29 that it has added support for bitcoin cash (BCH) to its wallet and card app. This means that users can now buy BCH from the service with credit card and bank transfer both available for funding.

The company explained that, as it also offers the MCO Visa card, this move adds additional utility to BCH as users can now easily convert digital funds into fiat currencies and spend them at over 40 million merchants supporting the network around the world.

Bitcoin cash is the 21st digital asset to be added to the platform, joining other popular cryptocurrencies and stablecoins such as BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, TUSD, and PAX, as well as the company’s own MCO and CRO tokens. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com said: “We’re committed to providing complete selection of all major digital assets and empowering our customers to purchase it at true cost without fees or markups.”

Accelerating the World’s Transition to Cryptocurrency

Crypto.com was founded in 2016 and launched an initial coin offering (ICO) in May 2017 after a year working on its offering in stealth development mode. The payments and card provider, formerly known as Monaco, today reports that it employs more than 120 people.

The company has announced it started shipping the MCO Visa card to customers in Singapore in October 2018. The following month it was also revealed that the cards will be issued in the U.S. through a partnership between its Florida-based affiliate Foris Inc. and Metropolitan Commercial Bank, New York. The cards, which have no annual, monthly or ATM withdrawal fees, can be ordered from the app.

In short, don’t call digital money “crypto.”

The six-letter word was traditionally associated with cryptography, but in recent years has been used to refer to bitcoin and the plethora of copycats and competitors that followed it, to the chagrin of many security specialists.

Now the AP writes that cryptocurrency is:

A type of digital money that uses encryption technology to make it secure. Avoid using the shorthand crypto, which can be confused with cryptography. Cryptocurrency is not the same as virtual currency, which is used in virtual worlds such as online games. [Emphasis added.]

The Stylebook even offered a bit of commentary on the best uses for cryptocurrencies:

Although it’s possible to trace bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies as they are spent, owners of accounts behind the transactions aren’t necessarily known. For this reason, cryptocurrency is a favored form of payments among criminals, including those behind ransomware, in which malicious software locks a computer and its data until a ransom is paid.

AP Style tip: Bitcoin is a digital currency. As a concept, Bitcoin is capitalized. The currency unit, bitcoin, is lowercase. — AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) February 25, 2014

Every year the Stylebook adds new terms to its lexicon. This year, in addition to “cryptocurrency,” “deepfake,” “electronic cigarette,” and “CRISPR” made the cut.

Many in the industry expressed excitement at the ruling as it signals that crypto – sorry, cryptocurrency – has become mainstream enough for the wonky Stylebook to give it a nod.

According to the report, security researcher Frost reached out to BleepingComputer about the trojan scam, saying that YouTube would take down the fraudulent videos when reported, but new accounts and videos would subsequently pop up with the same MO.

The videos reportedly describe a tool that lets users earn free bitcoin, with a link in the video description. The links then direct to a download for the alleged tool, which is the Qulab trojan. After downloading, the trojan actually needs to be installed in order for it to be deployed.

In addition to attempting to steal a plethora of user information, the Qulab trojan will also reportedly attempt to sneakily steal cryptocurrency for the bad actor by scanning for strings copied to the Windows clipboard which the program recognizes as crypto addresses, and then substituting in the attacker’s address instead.

If a user pastes that string into a website field to specify where their funds are spent, they will paste in the attacker’s string instead and direct the funds there.

The warning indicates that this is a viable strategy, since users are reportedly unlikely to remember or visually register that their intended crypto address — a long string of characters — has been swapped out for a different one.

According to a report by Fumko, there is a long list of crypto addresses the trojan can recognize, including ones for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, cardano, ether, litecoin, monero, and more.

Shawki Allam, the current Grand Mufti of Egypt, issued that ban in early 2018, stating the technology could undermine the legal system via tax evasion, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities. The Grand Mufti was also concerned with crypto’s volatility and scams.

However, as the market has expanded and neighboring countries have begun exploring the technology, the government is softening its stance.

The bill, according to the Egypt Independent, would give the board of directors of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) the right to regulate cryptocurrencies and require, multiple potentially expensive licenses to do business.

The report reads:

The new law provides legal authority for the electronic authentication of bank transactions, electronic payment orders, and transfer orders as well as for the electronic settlement of checks and the issuance and circulation of electronic checks and electronic discount orders, provided that Board of Directors of CBE issue rules and procedures regulating all the aforementioned actions.

Egypt has discussed cryptocurrency legalization for years before this move. The draft bill isn’t yet available for public reading.

CipherTrace announced Wednesday that it will help ensure sound anti-money laundering (AML) processes are in place for the firm’s Rakuten Wallet exchange platform, which is based in Tokyo.

Rakuten Wallet started accepting account registrations last month from those who have an account at Rakuten Bank or who already have a Rakuten member ID. It is yet to open the platform for the wider public.

“Regulatory compliance and anti-money laundering protections are of the utmost importance,” said Yoshinao Kiyama, head of the risk control department at Rakuten Wallet. “We believe CipherTrace will provide us the necessary tools needed to best support Rakuten Wallet.”

Last month, cryptocurrency exchange Binance also partnered with CipherTrace to enhance AML processes such as tracing the source of on-chain funds and matching user IDs to problematic wallet addresses across its platform.

Rakuten Wallet was previously known as Everybody’s Bitcoin, an exchange Rakuten acquired for $2.4 million last August. A rebranding of the entity to Rakuten Wallet took place on March 1, at which time the older service was closed.

The new exchange received a license earlier this year from the Japanese Financial Service Agency. The exchange is therefore registered with the Kanto Local Financial Bureau as a virtual currency exchange service provider under the country’s Payment Service Act.

Rakuten itself was a relatively early adopter of crypto, launching bitcoin payments for its U.S. e-commerce platform in 2015 via an integration with bitcoin payment processor Bitnet.

Per the announcement, GUSD deposits will see a yearly yield of 6.2%, paid in the stablecoin in question. BlockFi notes that it also offers GUSD as a U.S. dollar funding option and as collateral from institutional cryptocurrency borrowers. BlockFi CEO Zac Prince commented:

“The implication of adding this functionality is that you could see crypto companies like BlockFi compete with traditional fintech challenger banks by taking advantage of assets like Bitcoin for on-ramps in to a dollar-based blockchain financial ecosystem.”

BlockFi notes that the accounts will not be available to United States-based customers due to a lack of regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins backed by fiat currency. The firm states that it is working with legal counsel to add support for U.S. clients later this year.

Some in the cryptocurrency industry have criticized BlockFi, as its terms and conditions allow it to determine the interest rate each month at its sole discretion. David Silver of Silver Miller Law firm said the firm does not advertise what it guarantees, which could be confusing for users.

In March, BlockFi decreased the interest rates for its top tier bitcoin and ether accounts. In May, the lending platform further lowered interest rates for some of tis ether accounts as the lending environment for ether had purportedly floundered.

It’s been a viable and exciting option for a country that had been cut off from the global economic community up until 2015 and again in 2017, following a short reprieve after agreeing to dial down its nuclear energy program.

Despite all of this, Iran is still grappling with international pressures, including a ban on the acquisition of United States dollars in the country. American regulators are also looking to block the use of cryptocurrency as an alternate means for trade in Iran.

A changing stance toward crypto and blockchain

Iran has slowly changed its attitude toward cryptocurrencies over the past few years for a number of reasons.

Up until the beginning of 2017 the trade and use of cryptocurrency was of little to no concern to the regulating authorities in the country. In fact, data from May 2018 suggests that there has long been a voracious appetite for crypto trading in the country.

A major driving force for the adoption of crypto in the country was a decision in January 2017 to stop using the U.S. dollar in Iran. Driven by fresh travel bans imposed by the U.S. administration, the Iranian government looked to leverage the use of other stable currencies to continue foreign trade.

It didn’t take long before bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began being talked about as viable alternatives for the country’s international trade. A few months later, the Iranian government revealed plans to roll out the necessary infrastructure to nurture the use of bitcoin in the country.

In the same breath, authorities hammered home the importance of imposing regulations to ensure that the use of cryptocurrencies remains above board in November 2017. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and related departments were already hard at work making sure that the use and supply of crypto in the country was being supervised.

Just four months later, in February 2018, local press reported that the CBI had made a U-turn in its crypto-friendly approach by announcing plans to control and prevent usage of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Less than a week later, news broke that the Iranian government was exploring the creation of a state-backed cryptocurrency. With that slowly simmering in the background, the CBI banned local banks and financial institutions from buying, selling or trading cryptocurrency in April 2018.

The explanation given for the ban was based on fears around the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and financing terrorism. While it seemed a crippling blow to the crypto community in the country, a government minister revealed that a model for a domestic cryptocurrency had been developed at the end of April.

The use of cryptocurrency to bypass international sanctions became more evident as reports surfaced that Iran and Russia were looking into the possibility of facilitating bilateral trade with the use of cryptocurrencies. The countries had begun engaging with each other to explore using cryptocurrency transactions as an alternative to the SWIFT interbank payment system — which Iran has had little or no access to due to the international sanctions.

Foundations were laid over the following several months on the proposed state-run cryptocurrency, and the country announced that development was complete in August 2018. The plans were expected to be formally released once the CBI updated its stance on the industry.

Around the same time, the U.S. reinstated sanctions on Iran, heightening the need for an alternative to facilitate trade with the global economic community.

A month later, Iranian government departments agreed to recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry, with a legislative framework still to be developed by the Iranian National Cyberspace Center.

In January 2019, the CBI released a statement that cooled the fears of harsh sanctions toward the crypto sector in the country. The institution said it would consult crypto industry experts before finalizing new draft regulations for the sector.

Perhaps more exciting was the revelation that Iran was in talks with a number of countries around the possibility of conducting transactions using cryptocurrencies. The list included Switzerland, South Africa, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, Germany and Bosnia.

All of this was revealed during the annual conference on Electronic Banking and Payment Systems in Tehran. Nevertheless, Iran still has yet to unveil the full details of its proposed state-run cryptocurrency.

While Iran’s state-run cryptocurrency still remains somewhat of a mystery, blockchain development has come to the fore in 2019. The CBI has begun work on a national blockchain project that promises to overhaul its banking and financial sector.

The Borna platform is being developed by the Iranian Informatics and Services Corporation and blockchain solutions provider Areatak. The Borna platform will be built on the Hyperledger Fabric — IBM’s open-source enterprise blockchain solution.

Crypto sanctions to follow?

Unsurprisingly, parts of the international community have reacted negatively to Iran’s moves to explore and develop a state-run cryptocurrency. Exacerbating this point were reports of significant crypto investments made by Iranian’s in May last year.

In August 2018, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) called on the global community to monitor the use of crypto in Iran as an illegitimate means of bypassing sanctions. In essence, FinCEN was advocating for the scrutiny of any and all crypto transactions coming from Iran using a variety of intelligence and surveillance tools.

Following that, U.S. lawmakers went as far as introducing a bill looking to impart further sanctions on Iranian financial institutions as well as the development of its state-run cryptocurrency. The act would forbid transacting or dealing with any Iranian cryptocurrency, and sanctions would be imposed on any individual that does so.

This narrative and the proposed actions follow the aggressive financial sanctions coming out of America toward Iran over the past few decades.

Man down! LocalBitcoins ends trading support in Iran

As Iranians wait for clarity on the promised state-run cryptocurrency, local crypto users have been dealt another blow to their access to trading support. On May 24, popular cryptocurrency exchange LocalBitcoins announced a ban on users in Iran.

The decision was primarily due to the exchange’s headquarters being located in Finland. In an effort to comply with financial regulations of the country, the exchange has had to cut off its user base in Iran.

Cointelegraph reached out to Iranian-based developer Arame Bandari, who previously worked as a researcher at Iran Blockchain Labs, for some insight on the current crypto climate in Iran.

Bandari explained that the last 18 months have been difficult for the Iranian economy due to the resumption of U.S. sanctions. As a result, the value of the rial, Iran’s national currency, has declined, and people have looked to secure their capital by investing in foreign currencies or alternatives like the cryptocurrencies.

This is why LocalBitcoins’ move to end customer support in Iran is a big blow to the sector. As Bandari explained, the exchange saw booming activity in recent months from its Iranian users:

“Localbitcoins is one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms in Iran. According to Localbitcoins, in February during an eight week period of rapid growth, Iranians tripled their trade on its P2P platform. Nearly 34.56 billion IRR [$820,805] changed hands during the seven-day period, comprising the eighth strongest week on record when measured against fiat currency.”

The platform was highly successful in Iran because of the variety of payment methods it offered to users. Given that Iranian’s don’t have access to international payment platforms like Visa and Mastercard, LocalBitcoins provided easy access to a global trading platform.

According to Bandari, underground crypto trading became popular, but users had to trust buyers and sellers who they met through Telegram channels and the likes. LocalBitcoins provided a safer solution that reduced some of the risk.

Despite the exchange imposing a fresh ban on Iranian crypto traders, Bandari was optimistic that other exchanges would come forward to provide continued support:

“At this moment Iranians have access to LocalBitcoins through VPN [virtual private networks] which is very common in Iran. But I think this kind of restriction will cause a significant migration of Iranian traders to other platforms. We have been witnessed such a migration when Bittrex and Binance banned Iranians. This will be a great opportunity for newcomer exchanges to grab the Iranian exiled traders community.”

What are the alternatives for Iranian crypto users?

With the support of LocalBitcoins coming to an end, Iranian crypto traders will have to find other cryptocurrency exchanges to service their needs.

According to Bandari, the process is slightly more complicated due to the difficulty of converting Iranian rials into cryptocurrency. A popular way to do this is buying tether tokens (USDT) for rials through tether.land. From there, users can buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, then proceed to trade using Bittrex or Binance through the use of a VPN.

Another source from Iran highlighted two more popular platforms that have stepped up to fill the void left by LocalBitcoins.

Multisignature peer-to-peer (p2p) bitcoin exchange Hodl Hodl has been identified as a preferred alternative. The website has even provided a translation of its page into Iran’s dominant language, Farsi, and is offering discounted exchange fees up until mid-June this year. The website has also set up a dedicated Telegram group to communicate with Iranian users.

Another p2p exchange, keepchange.io, also reached out directly to Iranian cryptocurrency users through a blog post on Medium. It is offering users its services, as well as the ability to migrate trading data from LocalBitcoins to the keepchange platforms. Users can also access a “lifetime” trade bonus for referring customers to the exchange.

Waiting on Paymon to take off

There has been a “gold” lining for cryptocurrency adoption in Iran over the past few months, following a move to develop a gold-backed cryptocurrency in the country.

Four Iranian banks joined forces in February to spearhead the creation of PayMon — as the new token will be called. The project involves the Parsian Bank, the Bank Pasargad, Bank Melli Iran and Bank Mellat. Over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Iran Fara Bourse will list the cryptocurrency. It’s understood that 1 billion tokens will be sold in the initial release, which has yet to be confirmed.

Amid the economic turmoil facing Iranians, the news is a welcome boon for cryptocurrency users in the country. Bandari told Cointelegraph that any viable and trustworthy blockchain-based cryptocurrency solution will provide much needed relief to Iran:

“In my opinion, at this stage national any kind of coin or token can help to deal with national payment system or economic problems. In fact cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can not be used as an alternative payment method for massive intergovernmental trades, but it can be used for small businesses or merchants to facilitate payments which foreign parties.”

Given that Iran has been facing harsh economic sanctions from the global community for some time, concerted efforts to nurture blockchain technology, coupled with a cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulation, are setting an interesting precedent.

While the everyday crypto user may face some tough times ahead when trying to go about daily trading, there seems to be a glimmer of hope that country will openly adopt and use blockchain technology.",

Do you want every person you ever transact with to know how much is in your wallet and your net worth? Of course not. That’s why you need and want to mix your coins to hide where they came from before you use them. The degree of privacy you can expect by default, however, varies significantly depending on whether you are using BCH or BTC.

How Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core Stack up for Privacy

The Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains are public and possible for everyone to read simply by using any block explorer. So if you have 10 BTC and buy something for 1 BTC then the receiver of the 1 BTC can look at the address that the money came from and see that there used to be 10 BTC there. That would let the merchant know that they can probably raise their prices for you specifically for your next purchase and that you’ll comfortably afford and decide to purchase their merchandise anyway. The merchant employees would also learn that you would be a profitable target for robbery and maybe even kidnapping depending on the amounts and what country you live in or visit. One way to avoid revealing this information to the receiver is to mix your coins first.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is better than Bitcoin (BTC) at coin mixing because BCH transaction fees are practically free (less than $0.01 per transaction). The Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap is likely to intentionally cause onchain transaction fees to exceed $30/250 bytes again, just as they were in December 2017. The only reason why BTC transaction fees are currently low is because the cryptocurrency markets entered a bear market shortly after hitting $30 per transaction in 2017. BTC blocks have now started to become full on a regular basis again, and fees have begun to climb.

Criminalizing Coin Mixing

There are rumors that regulators are going to demand that mixed coins will be required to have changed ownership at least six times before they’re no longer considered to be mixed anymore and that fiat-to-crypto exchanges, at the very least, will not be allowed to handle coins that are considered to be mixed because regulators are trying to combat money laundering etc.

The obvious workaround for the trader or general currency user who wishes to preserve their privacy would be to send their already mixed coins six times (to a new address each time that they themselves control) to make it appear as if they were mixed by an owner far enough back in the chain of owners but not “recently”. That way the trader would have preserved their privacy and the exchange would be allowed to consider those coins to no longer be mixed.

The first problem with this is that the intentionally high on-chain transaction fees will make such “legitimizing” prohibitively expensive for BTC users. As a result, most BTC users will not mix their coins at all and only those who are willing to pay extreme amounts in additional transaction fees will mix their coins. That will make such expensively mixed coins look very suspicious compared to coins that have never been mixed.

The second problem is that the only people available to mix their BTC coins with you are people who are desperate enough to pay obscene amounts of fees to have their coins mixed. Your coins would not automatically be mixed with ordinary people who just want privacy. Mixing your coins with such desperate people would be futile, like trying to clean your hands by asking random people to urinate on them. For mixing to work well, ordinary people have to be the majority.

BCH does not have a high fee problem so mixing coins very cheaply and with regular people will most likely become the norm and even the default setting in most BCH wallet apps. This will serve to make mixed BCH coins look normal and not suspicious because “everyone is doing it, it’s practically free to do it and it makes sense to preserve everyone’s privacy in such a cheap and automatic way”.

BTC Mixing Is Costly and Cumbersome

An alternative way for BTC users to obfuscate public knowledge about the total amount in their spending wallets and their net worth could arguably be to use the Lightning Network. But the LN is so cumbersome to use for the common person that it’s unlikely that it will see much user adoption in the near future which means that preserving privacy by using BTC+LN instead of just BTC is unlikely to become the norm.

An example of why the LN should be considered unreasonably cumbersome compared to just using BCH cheaply and directly on-chain “as usual” is that a BTC+LN user first must purchase or otherwise obtain “incoming liquidity” from a liquidity provider such as Bitrefill (for a relatively high monthly fee), before the user can receive money through the LN to their LN wallet app. The user experience for BTC+LN users compared to BTC users is much more cumbersome and unintuitive, so new users should be expected to adopt BCH instead of BTC+LN when BTC on-chain transaction fees become unbearably high for most use cases again in the next bull market or even sooner.

Just think about it:

People don’t want to use the LN when transaction fees are high because it costs too much to open a channel. People don’t want to use the LN when transaction fees are low because then they can just send transactions cheaply and simply directly on-chain.

1+2 together means that most people don’t want to use the LN no matter what the BTC on-chain transaction fees happen to be.

The Blocksize Problem

What does the most recent data say about how real people choose to use BTC as currency? Do people in general accept the scaling roadmap that has been forced through by Bitcoin Core’s new project leader Wladimir van der Laan, despite most of the community loudly preferring the original scaling roadmap as envisaged and designed by the first two Bitcoin Core project leaders Satoshi Nakamoto and Gavin Andresen? The new BTC scaling roadmap forces users to transact using the Segwit and LN technologies by artificially limiting BTC’s base blocksize limit to a tiny 1 MB.

Segwit was designed to give a 75% transaction fee discount to the signature bytes of a transaction, conveniently benefitting LN transactions that use many more signature bytes per transaction than a typical on-chain transaction. Once a bitcoin has been transferred to a Segwit-enabled address, the bitcoin becomes cheaper to send the next time because of this new discount protocol rule. The Segwit technology has been criticized for (among many reasons) being complicated to implement for wallet app developers and a solution to a problem that was created because of the artificially imposed 1 MB base blocksize limit.

It’s one thing to convince the Bitcoin Core project leader, its other project members, the mining pool operators, miners, exchanges and payment processors such as Bitpay to accept the new scaling roadmap. That can be done by investing in a lot of companies, like Barry Silbert (CEO of Digital Currency Group) and a few others did, and then use that influence to make changes to Bitcoin protocol rules and project direction such as its scaling roadmap that really only a few community members want to be changed. Silbert is the person who proposed the Segwit2X “compromise” that was clearly designed to activate only Segwit but not the “2x” part (doubling the base blocksize limit three months after Segwit activated) of the agreement that was also promised. If Barry had honest intentions to activate the 2x part as well then he would’ve obviously designed the agreement to activate both Segwit and 2x at the exact same time so that no one could change their mind during the three-month delay.

It’s much easier to get 58 companies (many of which you’ve invested in) to agree to a clearly deceptively intended Segwit2x agreement than it is to get wallet app development teams to actually implement the complicated Segwit technology. Especially when making ordinary on-chain transactions continues to work, albeit with a higher transaction fee cost due to lacking the new fee discount and due to the base blocksize limit being unreasonably small. There’s also a difference between merely accepting the new protocol rules and actually implementing them as can be seen by looking at how long it takes for exchanges to actually implement Segwit for their incoming and outgoing transactions.

It seems as if Barry Silbert (DCG) forgot to invest in wallet app projects and companies because there were no such signatories (except Blockchain, BTC.com and Coinbase that have wallet apps aside from their main businesses, and Jaxx that only a few BTC people were using at the time) in the so-called New York Agreement.

The Segwit and LN adoption rates should be compared with the median transaction fee paid in USD per transaction during the time period from when transactions were still negligibly low until today. Looking at the median fee is arguably more accurate in this circumstance than looking at the average fee because exchanges and employers usually create one transaction that pays many people at once. The typical person (usually) creates a transaction that pays just one recipient and uses only one or just a few UTXOs per transaction.

What trends can we see? Has Wladimir’s new scaling roadmap worked as intended or have the higher transaction fees had other unintended effects? If we can observe a historical trend then we can try to make a somewhat informed guess about the future trend. So let’s start by looking at the median fees.

The above graph shows that the median fee paid was close to $0 per transaction in January 2017 when blocks were still not full on a regular basis. That’s as expected because the median block was full for the first time ever, starting around six months earlier as can be seen below.

Segwit was activated before the first (arguably) functional LN was released. So let’s look at Segwit adoption and compare it to the first graph with the median fees.

Picking a typical recent day of May 22, 2019 in the above graph shows that BTC users are creating Segwit transactions only in about 38% of the cases. Is that a high or a low adoption rate? That depends on who you ask of course but the more important questions are:

Has Segwit adoption stagnated? Did Segwit adoption rate increase noticeably when the median transaction fee was $34 per transaction in December 2017 (See the first graph)?

So far the answer to the first question is simply “yes”, it has stagnated at around 38% adoption since about April 2018 until today. The Segwit graph shows no movement up or down during December 2017 when BTC median transaction fees were at an all-time high.

Let’s look at LN adoption.

LN was scheduled to be released in June 2016 but was unfortunately “slightly” delayed and released on March 15, 2018 instead. So we can’t see the LN adoption rate during December 2017 because LN simply did not exist yet at that time. But we can see that the amount of BTC that’s being used by the entire LN today is about 1,000 BTC which is only 0.00564% of the current 17.7M supply. That’s not even one percent of one percent of all existing coins.

1,000 BTC (currently $8M) may sound like a lot and it would be for you and me but it’s not much for an entire network that was launched 14 months ago and that’s supposed to handle most BTC transactions according to Wladimir’s new BTC scaling roadmap.

So if Segwit has a very low adoption rate and LN also has a very low adoption rate then what are BTC users doing when transaction fees skyrocket to over $30 for a typical transaction? It seems they leave BTC and start using other currencies that have much lower transaction fees and have a much simpler user experience than BTC+Segwit+LN wallet apps have. Notice how the BTC market cap dominance suddenly decreased by a large percentage for the first time ever in June 2017 just half a month after it was announced that 58 companies had signed Barry’s Segwit2x New York Agreement, making it clear to anyone who still doubted that Bitcoin Core would get a new scaling roadmap that made on-chain transaction fees intentionally and perpetually very high.

Notice how BTC’s dominance suddenly decreased yet again when the less informed users and currency speculators discovered in December 2017 that on-chain transaction fees had become $34 per transaction.

It seems clear now that Bitcoin (BTC) users don’t and won’t accept Wladimir’s new BTC scaling roadmap that tries to force everyone to use Segwit and LN instead of just using direct on-chain transactions. Most BTC users will likely either keep using BTC directly on-chain with high fees or simply stop using BTC and start using one of the many competing cryptocurrencies instead. They simply won’t be willing to regularly pay expensive on-chain transaction fees just to mix their coins to increase their anonymity. That’s prohibitively expensive, even for us first-worlders who earn more than $2 per month.

The Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap seems to have been designed to make it unlikely that regulators, exchanges and tax authorities will allow “suspiciously expensively mixed BTC coins” to be used by the general public. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) scaling roadmap, on the other hand, is “Bitcoin as usual” which means that mixed BCH coins will likely be considered to be normal because they’ll remain cheap enough to mix so it won’t be “suspicious” for the general public to mix their BCH coins before using them. This difference makes BTC more like a trivially traceable fiat currency, far removed from how its original architects envisioned. Fortunately we have BCH, a fungible cryptocurrency that is simple to use and cheap to mix multiple times over.

Burgeoning in size and scope, Bitcoin now has its own form of currency capital: Bitcoin Cash. The new digital currency, created after an intra-crypto-family squabble, seeks to put Bitcoin on the same economic turf as major traditional global currencies like the dollar, yen and pound.

Does Bitcoin Cash have staying power? That's likely so, even though Bitcoin Cash has had a short and volatile history, but is making up ground fast among digital currency users.

To Know Bitcoin Cash, You First Must Know Bitcoin

Bitcoin Cash was spawned by Bitcoin, which originates from the cryptocurrency world.

It was originally introduced in 2009 by a blockchain group or individual (10 years later, nobody is entirely sure) named Satoshi Nakamoto. Around that time, the Nakamoto alias published a groundbreaking report on cryptocurrencies called the ""Bitcoin Whitepaper.""

In laying out the framework for Bitcoin, the report introduced the cryptocurrency as ""a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, which would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""

By establishing a ""virtual"" currency that provides a fast, inexpensive form of digital payments in lieu of using a traditional form of currency commerce, like banks or credit unions, Bitcoin was making a big statement. In doing so, Satoshi Nakamoto was taking direct aim at the central governments around the globe that controlled the flow of cash to regular people.

Bitcoin was created to disrupt the financial industry's currency model.

After growing slowly but steadily in its first several years, Bitcoin skyrocketed between August 2016 and August 2017. It soared from $572 per Bitcoin to more than $4,700 in that time frame. By the end of the year, Bitcoin accelerated upward to $13,800 before eventually cresting $19,000 each.

Bitcoin plummeted to around $5,000 in late 2018 and is around $8,000 today.

Even with the decline in value in 2018, Bitcoin has comprised 34% of all the globe's cryptocurrencies since then.

One Bitcoin Cash = $456, as of the end of May 2019.

What Is Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin Cash is a variance of Bitcoin. It's date of birth was some time in August 2017, when Bitcoin backers created the cash version to increase the speed of cryptocurrency transactions, but with lower fees than traditional banks.

Aside from fees, Bitcoin backers regularly complained about the cryptocurrency's scalability issues, which they believed constrained the growth of Bitcoin just as the public was warming to the idea of using cryptocurrencies instead of cash as a form of payment.

The problem with Bitcoin's scalability is that it wasn't up to the task, size wise. In cryptocurrency technical terms, Bitcoin was limited in size to just one megabyte (i.e., a million bytes, or 1MB.)

Basically, when more and more individuals are trading in Bitcoins and triggering larger transaction sizes in the process, limiting Bitcoin's size to a single MB held back the cryptocurrency's growth. The transactions weren't being completed fast enough - that was one of the primary goals when Bitcoin was introduced 10-years ago.

The resulting delays in transaction times and the lower number of transactions that actually cleared the Bitcoin network meant Bitcoin developers had to go in another direction - and that's where Bitcoin entered the picture.

Here's what happened and how Bitcoin Cash was set in motion.

The rising number of bitcoin community members (called ""miners"" by cryptocurrency enthusiasts) called for larger block sizes, but were rebuffed by bitcoin hardliners, who wanted the traditional block transaction sizes left largely in place.

In August 2017, the dissenting Bitcoin miners left to form their own cryptocurrency model, called Bitcoin Cash. The split was controversial among Bitcoin enthusiasts, but the so-called ""hard forkers"" (named so as the group ""split off"" from traditional Bitcoin) ultimately prevailed, as Bitcoin Cash began to thrive as a new currency.

Bitcoin Cash, once it was developed and put into commercial use (we'll spare you the onerous technical details), boosted its blockchain size from 1MB to 8MB to now 32MB, making it more streamlined. This led to the creation of its own transactions market. It also has led to the creation of competing higher-block Bitcoin models, including one from the original developers of Bitcoin.

That ""per block"" upgrade gave Bitcoin Cash users the same transactional power that the leading credit card and online payment systems deliver, thus leveling the payments playing field and giving Bitcoin renewed viability.

Where Can Bitcoin Cash Be Used?

Merchants have been slow to accept Bitcoin Cash but the fledgling currency is now widely available on major cryptocurrency exchanges.

As more exchanges make room for Bitcoin Cash, crypto experts anticipate that the new currency will grow in usage among commercial enterprises. That day has not yet come, for now, as Bitcoin Cash is largely walled off from major consumer and business currency usage.

We say ""largely"" as industry figures show that as of May 2019, 945 online companies do accept Bitcoin Cash, according to AcceptBitcoin.Cash. Higher profile retailers like Dish Network (DISH) - Get Report , Overstock.com (OSTK) - Get Report and Newegg are accepting Bitcoin Cash to better handle customer cryptocurrency payments.

Given the fact there are hundreds of thousands of online merchants operating in the U.S., 945 isn't a big number, but it is a number that's expected to rise in the coming years, as Bitcoin Cash grows in acceptance.

How Can I Obtain Bitcoin Cash?

There are several effective ways to get your hands on Bitcoin Cash. Here are the ""top of the list"" ways to do so:

You Already Own Old Bitcoins

Prior to the Bitcoin miners' hard-fork split from traditional Bitcoin in August 2017, you may have owned Bitcoins. That matters, as any Bitcoins owned prior to Aug. 1, 2017, are deemed as Bitcoin Cash, and can be claimed as such, as long as the Bitcoin wasn't held on an exchange on that date.

Purchase Bitcoin Cash

There are a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges where Bitcoin Cash is available, including Coinbase, Bitfinex and Kraken.

From Bitcoin Wallets

A growing number of Bitcoin wallets have made Bitcoin Cash available, including the traditional Bitcoin Wallet, Ledger and Trezor.

The Takeaway on Bitcoin Cash

The development of Bitcoin Cash has led to other efforts, including from Bitcoin itself, to increase the size of Bitcoin blocks and generate faster and less expensive transaction fees.

That's a good sign and also a nod to Bitcoin Cash, which has forced the major cryptocurrencies to raise their game and give cryptocurrency users what they want - a Bitcoin currency that makes it easier and faster to move Bitcoin around. It also gives banks a run for their money - literally - at the same time.",2019-05-30 17:08:42+00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/30/6-reasons-bitcoin-has-nearly-tripled-in-6-months.aspx,"It's back! Whether you realize it or not, the cryptocurrency market is on fire, once again, and it's being led by the most popular, and largest, digital currency in the world, bitcoin.

After hitting an all-time high of more than $20,000 per token in December 2017, bitcoin wound up losing more than 80% of its value over the next year. But since bottoming in the low $3,000 range this past December, bitcoin has been virtually (and literally) unstoppable. Earlier this week, bitcoin eclipsed the $8,800 mark during intraday trading, its highest value in just over a year, with the all-important and psychological $10,000 level once again within striking distance.

But, to many, bitcoin's ascent is somewhat of a mystery. After doing some digging, here are six logical reasons for bitcoin's near tripling in value over the past six months.

1. It's sort of ""technical""

One of the biggest knocks against cryptocurrency investing is that there are no fundamental metrics (at least the sort that we're used to as investors in equities) that'll help investors determine an appropriate value for crypto tokens. With the exception of underlying blockchain processing speed, there are no comparable metrics between tokens and blockchains.

What this means is that investors almost always rely on technical analysis -- i.e., chart patterns, supports, resistances, and volume -- to determine where digital currencies will head next. Relying heavily on technical analysis tends to lead to wild and momentum-based swings upward and downward in cryptocurrencies, which is exactly what we're witnessing with bitcoin at the moment.

2. Mining rewards will soon be halved

A slightly more tangible reason for bitcoin's ascent has to do with the expected halving of mining rewards by May 2020.

Cryptocurrency mining describes the act of people or businesses validating transactions on a blockchain as accurate and true. In the case of bitcoin, its transactions are validated via the proof-of-work model, whereby high-powered computers solve complex equations to proof transactions on the blockchain. As you can imagine, operating these high-powered computers can be expensive due to electricity costs and cooling needs (computers can create a lot of heat when at full operation). However, the block reward for folks who are the first to solve a block (i.e., group) of transactions is 12.5 bitcoins, which as of Tuesday's price of $8,700 per token equates to a haul of $108,750.

But every couple of years bitcoin's block reward halves. The next expected halving should occur in May 2020, with the reward dropping to 6.25 bitcoin per resolved block. Essentially, investors and miners are getting in ahead of this expected event by pumping up bitcoin's price, with miners attempting to gobble up as many block rewards as possible prior to this halving event.

3. Perceived scarcity

Building on the previous point, bitcoin's perceived scarcity is probably responsible for some of its recent ascent.

The largest cryptocurrency in the world has a glass ceiling cap of 21 million tokens, with more than 17.72 million already circulating, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. This supply grows as new blocks are solved and block rewards are paid to miners. Similar to how gold derives its value from the scarcity of physical metal in existence, bitcoin has pushed higher on the idea that its limited supply of tokens creates value. This upcoming halving event next May provides further ""evidence"" of this perceived scarcity.

4. Increased institutional interest

A fourth reason bitcoin has been heading higher can be traced to growing institutional interest in bitcoin from Wall Street and wealthy professional traders.

Generally speaking, bitcoin can only be purchased via unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges, which is almost always a no-go for institutional investors. The one exception being that bitcoin futures contracts were introduced in December 2017 by the CBOE Global Markets and CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) that allowed institutions to make bets on the future price of the popular digital coin. While volume for the CME's bitcoin futures contracts had typically ranged between 3,000 and 4,000 contracts per day before it began rising, it effectively doubled in the weeks and months that have followed. Although it's unclear if these bets are overwhelmingly bullish, it does suggest that interest in bitcoin is picking up on Wall Street.

5. An upcoming SEC decision on bitcoin ETFs

The rally in bitcoin could also be tied to an upcoming decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether or not bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be allowed on exchanges.

A decision by the SEC was actually expected months ago, but it's been delayed on numerous occasions by the regulatory agency. In a document filed by the SEC a little more than two weeks ago, it announced that it would be fielding comments from the public for three weeks, as well as rebuttals to those comments for an additional two weeks. Based on the new deadline, the SEC is expected to make its ruling on bitcoin ETFs by Aug. 19, or Oct. 18 at the latest if it chooses to delay its decision once again.

Should bitcoin ETFs be allowed to list their shares on major U.S. exchanges, it would likely lead to an influx of capital from small and large investors alike, and it could be something of a stabilizing force in an otherwise very volatile cryptocurrency space.

6. Blockchain projects are advancing

A sixth and final reason for bitcoin's major rally could have to do with the advancement of blockchain projects within the financial space, as well as in other sectors and industries.

Blockchain is the transparent but immutable digital ledger underlying nearly all crypto coins where transaction data is logged. Although bitcoin's blockchain is designed entirely for the purpose of accelerating financial transaction settlements, its blockchain is nonetheless the foundation from which other projects blossomed. As more brand-name businesses consider incorporating blockchain into the mix, the perceived validity of bitcoin's ""story"" gains steam.

Here's why you shouldn't buy into this latest rally

Clearly, there is no shortage of potential reasons behind this incredible surge in bitcoin. But none of these reasons hides the fact that a number of major deficiencies in the cryptocurrency investing thesis have yet to be addressed.

For example, even though blockchain is supposed to be a step up in security over traditional banking networks, theft has become a common problem. Earlier this month, popular crypto exchange Binance revealed that hackers stole 7,000 bitcoins, which are now worth about $61 million. Since the SEC has virtually no ability to track stolen coin or go after hackers outside the confines of the U.S. borders, most stolen cryptocurrency remains lost forever.

Bitcoin's utility, and the utility of nearly every other cryptocurrency, is perhaps the biggest issue of all. Most digital tokens aren't accepted by businesses due to their volatility and lack of financial regulation and backing. What's more, it's the blockchain technology underlying digital tokens that holds the real value... yet investors have zero ownership in this underlying technology when they purchase digital tokens.

With regard to bitcoin, its ""perceived scarcity"" argument is also an issue. This scarcity is purely based on computer code, whereas an asset like gold has physical (and thereby tangible) scarcity. If the bitcoin community somehow gained consensus, its circulation could extend beyond 21 million, debunking the ""scarcity"" of the most popular crypto coin.

And, lastly, there aren't any viable investment opportunities that make sense for investors. For instance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), which owned 225,638 bitcoin as of April 30, 2019, should have an easily calculable net asset value (NAV). But the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has regularly been valued at well above its NAV since inception, demonstrating that investors have built undue premium into the fund. Not to mention, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust charges a ridiculous 2% annual management fee for doing virtually nothing with its existing portfolio of coins.

As has been the case for years, the rally in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be eye-popping and jaw-dropping, but there's little, if any, substance behind these moves that merits investment.",2019-05-30,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-broker-client-reportedly-aims-to-acquire-25-of-all-bitcoin-supply,"Digital currency investment firm Dadiani Syndicate has reportedly been approached by a wealthy client to buy as close to 25% of the bitcoin (BTC) supply as possible, Forbes reported on May 30.

The Dadiani Syndicate is a peer-to-peer network where people trade between each other with cryptocurrency. The firm made news last year when it put 49% of Andy Warhol’s 1980 work ""14 Small Electric Chairs"" up for sale for bitcoin and other digital currencies. The firm’s founder Eleesa Dadiani reportedly claimed:

""One of our clients approached us and said they were interested in acquiring 25% of all bitcoin currently available. There are a number of entities who want to dominate the market.""

Dadiani said that acquiring a quarter of the current 17.7 million BTC supply — considering that many coins have been permanently lost — would not be possible without significantly affecting the market. EToro analyst Mati Greenspan stated, ""A buyer of this size is going to push the price up to make this kind of accumulation even more expensive,"" continuing:

""Yet even a greater number of coins are currently being held by hodlers who will not be willing to part with them for any price. Realistically speaking, there are probably less than five million coins actually circulating at the moment.""

Since January of this year, bitcoin has gained over 120% in its price, and broke the $9,000 price mark earlier today, soaring thus to its highest price point in over a year. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is down by 4.68% on the day and is trading at around $8,269, according to CoinMarketCap.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/russias-largest-bank-halts-crypto-plans-due-to-central-banks-negative-stance,"Russia's largest bank, the state-owned Sberbank, has suspended its crypto-related plans due to the central bank’s negative stance on the industry, local news agency TASS reports on May 30.

Sberbank vice president Andrey Shemetov has reportedly revealed the news at a recent press conference, claiming that Sberbank had been awaiting crypto legislation that would allow it to trade cryptocurrencies.

However, Shemetov stressed that the local financial regulator and the central bank, the Bank of Russia, is against the adoption of the crypto space at the moment. As such, the bank had to halt its plans relating to cryptocurrencies.

In the report, the official did not specify what particular project the bank had to suspend.

In January 2018, Sberbank’s subsidiary in Switzerland, Sberbank Switzerland AG, announced that it was planning to launch cryptocurrency exchange. At the time, Shemetov claimed that the bank had chosen Switzerland to establish the exchange because Russian authorities did not allow crypto operations.

Recently, Sberbank has requested a client to provide data on their income from cryptocurrency revenue.

Russian authorities have as of yet been unable to pass crypto legislation for a variety of reasons.

Most recently, TASS reported that Russia had to postpone the adoption of a crypto law due to a requirement from Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to legislate major industry terms such as crypto and bitcoin (BTC), instead of using the sole term “digital assets.” In particular, Russian lawmakers were reportedly avoiding some terminology in the bill in accordance with a “certain position” of the Russia’s central bank.

However, the central bank has subsequently reacted to the report, claiming that the draft bill on crypto regulation is prepared enough to be adopted in the spring of 2019, in line with the order of the country’s president, Vladimir Putin.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/30/bitcoin-emerges-as-the-big-winner-this-month-in-the-financial-markets-soaring-nearly-70percent.html,"Omar Marques | LightRocket | Getty Images

The world's first and largest cryptocurrency was one of the biggest winners this month. Bitcoin rallied more than 60% in May, hitting a high of $9,084 on Thursday. That's up from about $5,200 one month ago, and more than double its value to start the year. The S&P 500 is down about 5% in the same time period. Bart Smith, head of digital assets at Susquehanna, said the crypto rally was driven by a few different factors — including simmering trade tensions.

""The first is the net effect of the trade war with china and the U.S. is that the yuan is hitting a six-month low,"" Smith told CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday, adding that much of the interest came from China. ""Bitcoin was either a hedge or just an outright way to get capital outside of that country."" Global equity markets stumbled this month as the world's two largest economies remain locked in a stalemate over trade. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based digital asset manager Arca said that was top of mind for investors, especially as the Chinese yuan fell against the U.S. dollar. ""Chinese investors and the overall population know this, and are worried about protecting their capital and their purchasing power,"" Dorman said. ""This leads to capital outflows, and Bitcoin and other digital assets are a 'safe haven' for them."" The cryptocurrency became a household name at the end of 2017 as it marched to almost $20,000. Bitcoin has yet to recover to anywhere near that level, but climbed to a 52-week high this week. Bitcoin futures are also on pace for their best month ever, back to their inception in December 2017. Futures are heading for their fourth consecutive month of gains. Still, bitcoin has not quite caught on as a means of payment. Crypto bulls instead advocate its use-case as a store of value, or ""digital gold."" ""Bitcoin is not going to be a payment currency — it's going to be just like gold,"" Michael Novogratz, head of cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital and a former Fortress hedge-fund manager, told CNBC last week. ""It won that lane.""

Fidelity's cryptocurrency platform Fidelity Digital Assets will reportedly offer trading for institutional customers a matter of weeks, according to Bloomberg. Fidelity told CNBC in March that it has quietly rolled out its cryptocurrency custody and trade execution operations.

Cryptocurrency trading is on the rise in Malawi, leading to the central bank promptly issuing a public warning against them. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: The governor Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has warned that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and should not be used in place of the legal fiat currency, the Malawi Kwacha.

According to local media, Dr. Dalitso Kabambe released a statement in which he revealed that the central bank has observed the public’s interest in cryptocurrencies has increased. He said his institution received a growing number of inquiries about cryptos from the public and other interested parties.

The governor also noted that activities involving cryptocurrency trading are on the rise in the Southern African country.

Cryptocurrency isn’t legal tender, says RBM governor

The governor noted that cryptoassets are being used to carry out the functions of money or investing online. He made it clear that cryptocurrencies are not recognized by the central bank.

Reserve of Bank of Malawi wishes to advise the general public that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Malawi. The RBM is however aware that they are used as a means of payment or medium exchange, a store of value or invested assets online.

Kabambe pointed out that the central bank nor any other local public institution has no regulatory oversight over cryptocurrencies or activities related to them.

Cryptocurrencies, underpinned by blockchain technology, were designed to work without any central authority. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are decentralized and allow anyone to participate in the creation of new coins and maintaining the network through a process known as mining.

He warned current and potential cryptocurrency users to be vigilant against crypto firms, entrepreneurs, educators, and advisors because of their questionable credibility. There are no legally registered cryptocurrency exchanges in Malawi.

The governor noted that the blockchain is a versatile technology with far more beneficial use cases that go beyond cryptocurrencies.

Malawi is currently emerging from a controversial and unpredictable election marginally won by the incumbent president. The RBM joins a number of institutions and central banks such as the Reserve Bank of India that favor blockchain over bitcoin and its ilk.

Africa’s position on crypto

A number of African countries -with significant cash challenges – are adopting pro-crypto positions due to several reasons.

Zimbabwe’s central bank issued a cryptocurrency ban in May last year but by September, the country’s newly appointed finance minister said cryptocurrencies could potentially solve the country’s cash challenges.

The energy used to mine bitcoin has long caused debate over whether it’s a wasteful process. As the arguments have rumbled on, some people have been focused on mining coins with renewable energy. On May 29, Christian Ander, the founder of Stockholm’s Btcx exchange, explained how instead of selling surplus solar energy, he’s been using it to mine bitcoin and making 10X the money he would selling the electricity to the grid.

Choosing to Mine Bitcoin Over Selling Power to the Grid

Mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) utilizes electricity in order to power the ASIC machines that profit from mining coins. Over the last few years, as digital assets have grown more popular and the SHA-256 hashrate (the BTC and BCH consensus algorithm) has climbed to all-time highs, people have complained that the amount of energy used to mine is excessive. However, while some people spend a lot of time debating whether or not mining is using too much energy, there are lots of miners using a variety of renewable energy methods like wind power, hydropower, and solar. A great example of this can be seen in Christian Ander’s explanation of how he was making more money using excess solar to mine bitcoin than he was selling the energy to the power station.

“Time to start your miners tonight almost free energy in Stockholm tomorrow — instead of selling my surplus solar energy, I mine bitcoin,” Ander remarked. “1 kWh = 1,16 Kr($0.12) — That is more than 10 times the money if I would sell it to the grid. Using the most common miners on the market ($100 each which convert 1,3 kW -> BTC).”

Right now, certain miners in China and Canada are using hydropower to help offset electric costs and other mining operators use low-cost geothermal power in Iceland as well. But Ander isn’t the only person who has furthered the idea of minting digital assets with solar power. Lots of people have been promoting the concept while the SHA-256 hashrate climbs exponentially, pushing operators toward greener energy solutions. For instance, on July 1, 2017, a man from San Diego detailed how he’s been mining in the desert with twenty-five S9 miners inside his greenhouses. According to the San Diego desert miner, he ran everything 100% off-grid with solar and battery power and said he was “profitable.” Solar farming, in general, can be profitable for those simply selling to the grid but it depends on the land’s rental costs, geographic location, and the size of the solar installation. Recent estimates disclose that on average a typical solar farm can produce between $21,250 and $42,500 per acre every year.

The Grid Backup Plan Provides Minimal Risk

Tam Hunt, the founder of a renewable energy project called Community Renewable Solutions, has outlined how solar energy could boost bitcoin mining while at the same time reduce energy consumption. Hunt’s study reveals that instead of selling electricity to the grid, mining cryptocurrency could be far more lucrative. The research claims that the “solar-plus-Bitcoin operation pays for itself in about two years” and after the return-on-investment (RoI) is completed “there is minimal risk remaining.” This is because if the price of bitcoin suddenly crashed below profitable levels, the operation has a backup plan because they can just sell the power to the grid. Hunt describes how off-grid mining operations can be done in areas with no power lines and where acreage is extremely affordable.

“Under this scenario, the miners are connected to the internet via a satellite connection, but otherwise the entire project is off-grid — All solar power is used for mining,” Hunt notes in his study. “This kind of facility could also include onsite storage to both smooth production and to extend mining operations beyond daylight hours.”

No Major Solar Mining Operations in 2019, but One Firm Claims to be Building a 20MW Sun-Powered Facility in Australia

Over the last few years, there’s been a lot of FUD surrounding bitcoin mining consuming too much energy. China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) detailed on April 9 that the department believes bitcoin mining “waste resources and pollutes the environment.” But there’s a lot of data and reports that show otherwise and that mining rigs can also produce their own heat power as well. A recent Coinshares study indicates that 78% of bitcoin miners utilize renewable energy sources. In March 2018, the co-founder of the Nakamoto X exchange, Kamil Brejcha, showed the world how he used excess mining heat to grow tomatoes. Later that year people read about a residential block in the freezing Russian province of Siberia with local grandmothers mining coins for profit and heat dissipation. Known as the Siberian babushkas, one woman explained how they used the hot air from miners to dry spices. “All the hot air is perfect for drying pumpkin, tea, and herbs — It dries very quickly — In just one day,” one of the babushkas explained.

There are all kinds of methods people use to harness renewable energy to mine bitcoins. Oddly enough, solar energy is not being used by major mining operations as the dominant renewables powering facilities have been hydro and geothermal. Although last summer, reports indicated that Hadouken Pty Ltd was approved to build a 20-megawatt solar farm that will be specifically used to mine digital currency. The mining operation is said to be situated in Collie Australia near a power company called Muja that produces 854 megawatts of electricity. Similarly, if there were a sudden cryptocurrency price downturn and mining wasn’t that profitable, Hadouken could simply sell the power to the grid. If individuals like Christian Ander have noticed that using solar-generated electricity to mine bitcoin makes 10X what could be made selling the power to the grid, then many other people are likely aware of the same idea.

A sharp rejection of resistance above $9k was not entirely unexpected. Bitcoin price has been poised to pass this level for the best part of the week. When it did, an instant fake out occurred and crypto prices plunged back a thousand dollars in a matter of hours.

Crypto Market Cap Takes a Hit

The move sent $25 billion out of digital assets and back into fiat as fears of a bigger correction mounted. Total market capitalization reached a new 2019 high of $285 billion when BTC made its move above $9k. From there it was smashed almost 10 percent in a couple of hours plunging back below $260 billion.

As usual the altcoins have been hit the hardest. Most of them are still hopelessly coupled to bitcoin, so much that when it gets a cut, they hemorrhage. Many were dumping double digits during Asian trading today. Bitcoin SV, following its fake pump yesterday, shed 20 percent while Bitcoin Diamond lost 18 percent.

Ethereum 00 fell back to $250 in a 10 percent slide and Bitcoin Cash dropped to $420 after losing a similar amount. The rest of the altcoins are in pain at the moment as all gains over the past couple of days get wiped out.

Looking at the bigger picture, a market cap of $260 billion is still up 7 percent on the week, 54 percent on the month and over a hundred percent since the beginning of the year. May has been the brightest month for crypto for a long time so this movement is pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.

Will Bitcoin Dump 30%?

There have been many calls for a pullback of this magnitude recently. After all, it has happened eight times during the last uptrend.

If this is the beginning, BTC/USD will return to $6k before hitting support and stabilizing. Analysts are still of mixed opinion as to whether this will actually occur or not. Trader Josh Rager tweeted:

$BTC pullback came before the level everyone was expecting … Majority have been front run all year and this is another case. Could still bounce from low $8ks to $9k+ but would like to see a daily close above $8200. Bulls stepping in.

At the time of writing Bitcoin had stabilized above $8,200 after dropping over ten percent in a few hours yesterday. A fall below $8k could see things turn south pretty quickly with the next major support level lying around the $7,400 zone. Dropping below that will be in the 30 percent territory, which is likely to lead to mass accumulation around $6,000.

Overall, corrections are natural so market movements over the past 24 hours should not cause concern. The crypto winter is definitely over and the term ‘buy the dip’ is now on everyone’s lips.

Cons: When questioned by the New Yorker’s writer, the 31-year-old Helsinki Institute for Information Technology researcher explained that he had no cryptography knowledge and his C++ programming was rudimentary.

Fun fact: Vili Lehdonvirta is now an Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, and a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute who has written about Bitcoin, most recently in an article titled “Bitcoin isn’t a currency – and unless it becomes one it could be worthless.”

Paul Le Roux

Pros: If Le Roux created Bitcoin, Satoshi is the 21st century’s biggest bad-ass. Encrypted software creation, drug smuggling, pharmaceuticals, gun running, nation building, you name it, Le Roux had a finger in it – and building Bitcoin would have been well within his grasp and megalomaniacal ambition.

Cons: When Satoshi was studiously refining Bitcoin in 2009, Le Roux was already dabbling in drug smuggling gun running and empire building. It seems unlikely that these opposing pursuits would have been compatible. Also, Satoshi always came across as humble in his writings. Le Roux was a power-tripping douchebag who insisted on being called “Boss.”

Fun fact: Le Roux’s online pharmaceutical system circa 2006 is described in “The Mastermind” as follows: “Take one out and another simply slotted into place. The network kept humming on.” Remind you of anything?

Gavin Andresen

Pros: Gavin Andresen is the Bitcoin developer Satoshi handed the reins to upon his departure in 2010. If the two were one and the same, this would be a pretty effective way for Satoshi to check out without ever actually leaving the building. Moreover, according to one stylometry study, Andresen’s writing more closely resembles Satoshi’s than any other candidate.

Cons: In 2016, Andresen became the first of many bitcoiners to be hoodwinked by Craig Wright, after venturing that Wright’s Satoshi claim checked out. Either Andresen was super gullible or he was playing 4D chess to put further distance between himself and his pseudonym.

Fun fact: Gavin Andresen created the first bitcoin faucet in 2010. It dispensed 5 BTC to anyone who visited the site and completed a captcha.

Hal Finney

Pros: As the first respondent to Satoshi’s mailing list post announcing Bitcoin, and the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, Hal Finney epitomizes Bitcoin more than any other known person. Finney saw the long-term potential for Bitcoin just like Satoshi, and could eloquently elucidate a world in which it reigned supreme. Just to add to the body of evidence, Gavin Andresen isn’t the only person whose writing style echoes Satoshi’s: writing analysis experts Juola & Associates claim that Nakamoto’s and Finney’s writings bear the closest resemblance.

Cons: For Satoshi to have essentially conversed with himself and transacted with himself in dealing with Finney doesn’t make sense for a character who went to such lengths to conceal his identity. He would have surely known that Finney would get doxed as him at some point, and thus it seems illogical for Satoshi to have left such an obvious trail of breadcrumbs.

Fun fact: Hal Finney lived two blocks away from Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, giving rise to theories that the former took his nom de plume from the latter. As one redditor postulated: “Hal and his cypherpunk counterparts intended for this old friendly retired man whose house had been foreclosed by banksters to be the symbolic figure behind the financial renaissance on behalf of all the victims of the modern financial system.”

Nick Szabo

Pros: Stylometry seems to be an imprecise art given the number of people who have been identified as Satoshi by their writings. Nick Szabo is the third such candidate on this list, but there are way more compelling reasons why he’s likely to be Satoshi, such as the fact that the computer scientist’s “bit gold” is the closest forerunner to Bitcoin. Nick Szabo is more qualified than anyone on this list to have built Bitcoin.

In 2008, Szabo commented in his blog that he was planning to create a live version of bit gold; that this should have manifested, a few months later, as Bitcoin seems credible. Szabo’s excellent blogposts circa 2008 have all the hallmarks of Satoshi. Phrases such as “unforgeable costliness” and shout outs to Hal Finney place Szabo extremely close to Bitcoin’s nucleus.

Cons: Szabo has consistently denied being Satoshi, debunking one such instance in 2014 by writing: “I’m afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I’m used to it.”

Fun fact: Satoshi’s telling decision not to cite Szabo’s work on bit gold in the Bitcoin whitepaper may be the most compelling evidence of all.

Bram Cohen

Pros: Born in 1975, the same year Satoshi cites as his DOB, Bram Cohen was playing with “bits” long before Bitcoin. The Bittorrent creator once ran a Usenet site called Bitconjurer.org, where he conversed with the creator of Hashcash, which inspired Bitcoin. Cohen’s prolific blogposts also slowed to a crawl when Satoshi began work on Bitcoin, and he had similar interests to Satoshi, writing about hiding one’s identity online in 2009, and weighing in on digital signatures around the same time. Cohen’s interest in recreational mathematics also makes him a credible Satoshi.

Cons: Cohen’s current project is a “green” cryptocurrency called Chia that he claims to be the “antithesis” of Bitcoin and PoW. It’s hard to imagine Cohen dismissing his former life’s work in this manner.

Fun fact: Cohen has tweeted about Satoshi 10 times over the years, but has never outright denied being him.

Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto

Pros: Aside from sharing the same name as Bitcoin’s creator, there is virtually no reason why Dorian Nakamoto should be Satoshi, except for having lived a few blocks away from the other probable Satoshi, Hal Finney. If anything, though, this would make it more likely that Hal was Satoshi, and borrowed his fellow denizen’s name.

Cons: Dorian may have become the face of Satoshi, but he is certainly not the brain.

Fun fact: Such is his celebrity, Dorian Nakamoto has been booked to appear at blockchain conferences.

Craig Wright

Pros: Wright really, really, wants to be Satoshi, and has been larping as him since 2016. You can probably recall feeling the same way about one of your superheroes, wishing you could fall asleep and wake up in their body. In your defense, you were six at the time. Wright is a 48-year-old man.

There is some evidence that Wright was lurking in the shadows not long after Bitcoin got off the ground, but all that proves is that Faketoshi is a chancer who’s built a career out of riding in the slipstream of brighter stars.

Cons: Craig and cons go together like moonshine and mason jars. It’s hard to pick a favorite, but Jameson Lopp’s lengthy takedown of the man who would be Satoshi is a fine jumping off point.

Fun fact: Wright applied to the Australian Defence Force Academy to train as a pilot in 1987 but was rejected.

Dave Kleiman

Pros: Kleiman has been alleged to be a part of the Satoshi Nakamoto group along with fellow Satoshi claimants Craig Wright and Phil Wilson. The latter two have zero credible proof of building Bitcoin, while Kleiman died in 2013. An avid cryptographer, Kleiman was a member of the mailing list where Satoshi first announced Bitcoin on Oct 31, 2008. He also worked for S-doc, an encryption-focused software company that was developing an “unalterable, encrypted audit log system.”

Cons: Any documents associating Kleiman with Bitcoin come courtesy of Craig Wright, and thus are almost certainly fake. As a result there is an absence of credible evidence to suggest that Kleiman created Bitcoin. The fact that Wright has been circling Kleiman’s family like a vulture in a bid to claim his share of an alleged 1 million BTC trust is the strongest evidence that Kleiman created Bitcoin – and Wright didn’t. Had any other member of the cryptography mailing list died first, Wright would have surely set his sights on them instead, as part of a long con to extract millions of dollars through legal chicanery.

Sad fact: Dave Kleiman died in abject poverty and squalor. “His body was found decomposing and surrounded by empty alcohol bottles and a loaded handgun … a bullet hole was found in his mattress, though no spent shell casings were found on the scene.”

An Enduring Mystery That May Never Be Solved

There are many others who’ve been named as Satoshi, including Elon Musk, white supremacist James Bowery and, slightly more credibly, a trio of researchers – Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry. These, along with other suspects, are unlikely to have had a hand in the creation of Bitcoin however. For anyone interested in trying to crack the case, Satoshi’s writings, amounting to 80,000 words, can be viewed at the Nakamoto Studies Institute. Be prepared to tumble down a rabbit hole of late night Google searches and stylometry only to emerge no closer to the truth.

Most people who are hung up on the enigma of who Satoshi is or was would concede that it would be best for Bitcoin if his identity was never discovered. And yet they cannot resist searching for, to quote Albert Einstein, “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.”

The bill — which had been prepared by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and accepted by the House in mid-March of this year — has been passed by a majority in the House of Councilors plenary session, according to an update today on the FSA’s website.

The bill seeks to introduce amendments to two national laws that apply to crypto assets — the Act on Settlement of Funds and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Now that the bill has been passed, the revised acts are expected to come into force in April 2020, Cointelegraph Japan reports.

The proposed amendments to Japan’s financial instruments and payment services laws will ostensibly tighten cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to promote user protection, more robustly regulate crypto derivatives trading, mitigate industry risks such as exchange hacks, and broadly establish a more transparent regulatory framework for the new asset class.

As previously reported, the bill also establishes a legal name change for cryptocurrencies as “crypto assets,” formerly designated in the country as “virtual currencies.”

The bill also provides for more robust legislation for crypto margin trading, limiting leverage to two to four times the initial deposit.

Cointelegraph Japan today notes that, while there is reportedly a view within the industry that regulation has thereby been tightened, some consider that Japan's virtual currency regulation will set a global benchmark for regulating the sector.

In April, Japan’s minister of finance and deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, urged reporters to stop using the term “virtual currencies” and to shift to the newly introduced legal name. The new definition ostensibly aims to prevent investors from confusing cryptocurrencies with legal tender.

Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that Russia was postponing the adoption of crypto regulation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force that it expand the terminology of a federal bill to legislate major industry terms such as cryptocurrencies and bitcoin (BTC).",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrencyalerting-com-will-notify-you-of-price-movements/,"Cryptocurrencyalerting.com Will Notify You of Price Movements

""What do we do about the press? Wall Street Journal reporters get up in the morning, sell Apple short and then go write stories about us. And, it’s clear that it’s perception versus reality. They don’t know s--- about operating systems. They don’t know anything about tools. They don’t know what’s going on in the future. They don’t know that we’re building icebergs, and building from the bottom up.""

The bitcoin (BTC) market is in a somewhat similar position. The mainstream media has published quite a handful of negative headlines. A considerable population of traditional finance folks, who can't wrap their heads around the need and use of bitcoin, are happy to point at inconsistencies in the market to back their ""I told you so"" declarations about how they believe bitcoin is a farce.

Jobs replied by comparing the way the press treats new developments to how people tend to treat a child whom they saw as an infant, disregarding the fact that the child might have matured considerably since then.

In the case of bitcoin, the lag time is not only true for the press, but also for regulators and traditional finance professionals. Additionally, it appears that the crypto community is accepting and following the notion — perhaps unintentionally — by educating the public about how bitcoin and the crypto space at large are evolving. There have been scads of reports with the aim of doing just that. The latest is from Bitwise Asset Management, an American crypto asset fund manager.

Bitwise has recently prepared a 104-page white paper. In it, the fund manager argued that the bitcoin market still has inconsistencies regarding trading data, but the legitimate part of the market has a ""remarkable efficiency.""

The report builds on a presentation Bitwise had made to the United States Security Exchange Commission (SEC) in March of 2019 to back up its cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) application filing.

Here's are the most important points, with some perspective, from the report.

Approximately 95% of reported BTC trading volume is fake

As part of the research, Bitwise analyzed trading data of some 83 exchanges. Researchers said they looked at the trade size histograms, volume spike alignment and spread patterns of these exchanges. They concluded that there are only 10 exchanges with 100% real trading volumes, and these 10 exchanges collectively account for 5% of the reported trading volume.

Bitwise classifies the 10 exchanges as real volume exchanges or reference exchanges. The 10 exchanges include Binance, Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex. Among the 73 exchanges that Bitwise condemned as displaying fake volumes are OKEx, HitBTC and Huobi.

As expected, there were questions raised about the reliability of the Bitwise study considering that these popular exchanges aren't regarded as real volume exchanges. Bitwise pointed out that the trading data of the three exchanges doesn't follow that of Bitwise's real volume exchanges. It also referenced existing research that found similar patterns with the three exchanges to support its findings.

Using the data above, the average daily volume of these three exchanges would have increased the volume of legitimate trading in the Bitwise study from $554 million to $622 million. But the researchers said that it wouldn't have materially changed their conclusion.

HitBTC published a blog post in response to Bitwise's report in which it says it that it has a different customer profile compared to other exchanges, particularly those that the report branded as legitimate. That's because the exchange supports algorithmic trading, whose pattern is likely to noticeably differ from human trading. HitBTC wrote:

""Different exchanges have different customer profile. HitBTC is among the first crypto exchanges to offer low-latency institutional grade (FIX) trading API. This is why the client profile of HitBTC differs from that of unmentioned but implied ‘reference exchanges’.""

Low-latency trading simply means strategies that respond to market events in milliseconds, and algorithmic trading is one of those strategies.

Bitwise did recognize the use of algorithms in crypto trading by pointing out that the average price deviation of 0.12% across its real volume exchanges is within the arbitrage band, adding that the trend ""suggests that institutional-quality arbitrageurs and algorithmic programs are in place that monitor the system and identify and capitalize on any pricing discrepancies to constantly keep the prices closely together.""

OKEx, on the other hand, admitted that some traders engage in wash trading on its platform to quickly build their trading volume so they could enjoy a lower fee structure.

The remaining 5% makes up for a highly regulated and efficient market

With six of the 10 legitimate volume exchanges in the report based in the U.S., Bitwise argues that the crypto space is more regulated than presumed. Of the 10 exchanges, only Binance isn’t a money services business (MSB), while only the four non-U.S.-based exchanges don't possess a BitLicense, which is issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This level of oversight only breads transparency.

The crypto market is maturing thanks to developments since December 2017

The year 2017, marked the time when bitcoin attracted the most attention from the mainstream world, thanks to the wild bull run that saw the crypto go from just under $1,000 per BTC to nearly $20,000 by the end of the year. But, the following 12 months saw the price drop to as low as nearly $3,000 during a period that is widely regarded as the crypto winter.

Bitwise research suggests that the bitcoin market has significantly matured over the period. First of all, pointing to a downward trend in the average deviation of bitcoin’s price on its 10 reference exchanges from the consolidated price in the broader market, research claims that the quality of the bitcoin spot market has improved.

According to the chart, the price of bitcoin on the 10 exchanges deviated by as much as 0.25% to 0.4% between January and March 2018. The trend, however, levels out as of April 2018. Bitwise suggests that this trend shows the growing competitiveness of bitcoin arbitraging.

Also, the introduction of bitcoin futures in December 2017 has attracted bigger traditional market players to the crypto space and has so far made the market more organized, according to Bitwise. The cryptocurrency space has seen the entrance of one of the world’s largest asset managers, Fidelity Investments, which has built a custodianship solution.

Algorithmic market makers including Jane Street, which traded more than $8 trillion across all financial products in 2018, also started offering bitcoin trading in 2018. Other large algorithmic market makers that have entered the space include Susquehanna International Group, FlowTraders and Jump Trading LCC.

These developments, according to Bitwise, have allowed the bitcoin market to sizeably grow in efficiency. The paper points at trends on how deviations in price are being rapidly wiped off the market as proof that institutional-grade tools are being deployed.

Nail-biting moments in anticipation of Bitwise ETF ruling

Bitwise is currently awaiting a decision to be made on its ETF filing with the SEC. With this report, the crypto asset manager aims to alleviate the SEC’s fears and show the commission that the market has matured to a level where it can sustain an ETF product.

When the SEC rejected an ETF application by the Winklevoss brothers last year, it expressed concerns that regulated derivatives markets such as the bitcoin futures market are small relative to the spot market. In turn, this would make it difficult to see through the unregulated, and possibly fraudulent, nature of the bitcoin market.

By showing that the spot market is significantly smaller than often reported, Bitwise pointed out that the size of the bitcoin futures market is almost as large as the bitcoin spot market. Through this, the fund manager hopes to persuade the SEC to finally ease up on its concerns regarding cryptocurrencies.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-establishes-committee-for-cryptocurrency-regulation,"The President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil has ordered to establish a commission to consider cryptocurrency regulation in the country, Cointelegraph Brasil reported on May 31.

The Chamber of Deputies of Brazil is a federal legislative body and the lower house of the National Congress of Brazil, and consists of representatives of the states elected every four years. The Chamber discusses and approves proposals for economic and social areas such as education, health, transport, and housing.

On May 30, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Rodrigo Maia has requested the creation of a special commission to deliver an opinion on bill 2303/2015, which aims to regulate bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies in Brazil.

The commission will be composed of 34 members in accordance with the House Rules of Procedure. The notice also states that Federal Deputy Aureo Ribeiro presented two projects in regard to cryptocurrency regulation.

Earlier this week, the president of the Brazilian Association of Crypto and Blockchain (ABCB), Fernando Furlan, had a meeting with other representatives of the industry and authorities of the Attorney General's Office, the Central Bank of Brazil, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Activities Control Council.

The meeting was devoted to the recognition of the crypto and blockchain sector in Brazil and the application of the rules of the Financial Action Task Force on cryptocurrencies. The rules will be officially presented at the G20 finance ministers meeting in June in Japan, while companies will have until 2021 to adapt to the rules.

Also this month, the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service published a new tax rules for cryptocurrencies.

The news was reported by Bloomberg on May 31.

The low figure is ostensibly symptomatic of a speculative trend that Bloomberg suggests is preventing the cryptocurrency from being adopted for payments: as bitcoin continues to see significant volatility and renewed valuation gains, its nature as a speculative asset purportely disincentivizes users from using it as a unit for spending.

Accumulation — or HODLing, as the industry acronym goes — thus appears to be in direct conflict with the cryptocurrency’s future as a replacement for fiat currencies. In an email to Bloomberg, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at the firm, proposed that:

""Bitcoin economic activity continues to be dominated by exchange trading. This suggests Bitcoin’s top use case remains speculative, and the mainstream use of Bitcoin for everyday purchases is not yet a reality.""

As part of its dataset, Chainalysis reportedly monitors crypto payment service providers such as BitPay, which reportedly processed $1 billion for merchant in both 2017 and 2018.

Chainalysis’ data shows that merchant activity for bitcoin peaks during a crypto market bull run — as in late 2017, when merchant services hit a high of 1.5% of total bitcoin activity, before dropping to 0.9% in 2018 during the bear market and then rising again during this year’s recovery. BitPay CCO Sonny Singh told Bloomberg the firm had observed the same trend.

Between January and April of this year, exchange-related transactions nonetheless continued to account for 89.7% of all bitcoin activity — down just a fraction from 91.9% for the whole of 2018, Chainalysis’ data indicates.

This month, major U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that Coinbase Commerce — its crypto payment processor for merchants — would begin supporting Circle’s stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).",

The leading cryptocurrency drew most of the attention, rising 67 percent from $5,265 on May 1st to $8,900 by month’s end. A considerable amount of the gains happened in the lead up to the New York Blockchain event, that took place during the second week of May.

For instance, sharp rallies in bitcoin’s price on May 11 and May 13 pushed its price tag above $7,000 and then $8,000 for the first time in over a year.

Despite logging its best monthly gain since 2017 however, BTC ranks tenth on the list of May’s best-performing cryptocurrencies, according to Messari.io data.

Names like Chainlink (LINK), Dent (DENT), bitcoin SV (BSV), Holochain (HOT) and bitcoin gold (BTG) took a clear lead, each rising between 65 and 256 percent against their respective trading pairs with the U.S dollar.

The total capitalization of the broader market excluding bitcoin reflected the growth by rising to $125.6 billion on May 30th– its highest value in nearly 10 months.

Bitcoin pairings

The performance of individual altcoins when paired against BTC fared much worse, however.

Ether’s pairing with BTC, for example, found itself still unable to scale its 200-day moving average for much of the month, and at the time of writing has only increased roughly 2 percent since May 1 whereas its USD pair is currently up over 60 percent in the same time span.

Such a discrepancy between the performance of both pairs can be attributed to bitcoin’s price rally inflating the USD value of most altcoins while devaluing in BTC terms.

That said, a number of cryptocurrencies were able to flash strong performances in both categories, case in point being the top five performers for the month of May seen below.

Top 5 Monthly Performers In May

BSV | Price: $197 | MCAP: $3.5 billion | Percent Change: +231 percent

The crypto project aptly named ‘Satoshi’s Vision’ claims to be the “original bitcoin,” by restoring BTC’s first protocol while stating that it can massively scale with increased stability.

Bitcoin SV had a remarkable run during May and was the clear leader during the second half of the month after prices broke out on May 21, bringing it back above the elusive $100 price tag.

Prices peaked at $252 according to data from Bittrex after landing itself in overbought territory and triggering a pullback, as shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) exceeding a value of 70.

BSV/USD remains bullishly bid above a technical resistance level of $148, but a strong close below could re-expose the $90 support in the coming weeks.

LINK | Price: $1.01 | MCAP: $364.3 million | Percent Change: +96 percent

Chainlink’s (LINK) staggering 200 percent rise in mid-May suffered a setback as the monthly close approached, but today remains 96 percent up on the month, placing it firmly in 2nd place within the top 5 performers for May.

Concerns are now building for greater drawdown, courtesy of a candle close below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line on the daily chart, exposing the neutral pivot along the 50 percent retracement at $0.84.

Prices remain bullishly bid above the 200-daily moving average (red line) and above a key resistance that became support at $0.68, but expect a pullback if its price breaks below the neutral 50 percent retracement.

DENT | Price: $0.001747 | MCAP: $124.1 million | Percent Change: 78 percent

DENT is a token issued on the ethereum blockchain that aims to facilitate global communications via its platform and service offerings.

Its performance on the month was bullish to say the least, concluding May with a 78 percent higher price than it started and ranking as the 3rd best performer of the month.

However, recent market developments have thrown into contention the short-term bullish trend as prices dipped below a key support by the time the monthly trading period came to a close.

Similar to that of LINK, the longer term view remains bullish while trading above the 200-day moving average (red line), which looks set to complete positive crossover with the 100-day moving average on another significant upward move.

BTG | Price: $26.71 | MCAP: $475.8 million | Percent Change: +64 percent

Bitcoin Gold (BTG), yet another bitcoin fork, changed BTC’s proof-of-work algorithm from SHA256 to Equihash, rendering specialized mining equipment obsolete in an attempt to democratize the mining process.

Traders heavily favored BTG buy opportunities in May, leading it to place as the 5th best-performing crypto this month, outperforming other notable bitcoin forks such as bitcoin diamond (BCD) and bitcoin private (BTCP).

BTG’s rising channel spanning more than four months looks set to break down courtesy of a rising wedge (bear reversal pattern) residing within the channel’s most recent price action. In addition, a long upper wick on the daily timeframe is evidence strong sell pressure still exists above $30.

Should momentum falter here, a drop in value toward the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line at $20.34 may be in the offing, but will remain bullish so long as the channel pattern holds.

HOT | Price: $0.002165 | MCAP: $288.4 million | Percent Change: +74 percent

Holochain (HOT) is a decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus mechanisms between users.

Beginning in late May, HOT managed to break a key resistance zone of $0.0016, carving out a further 57 percent rise in value before prices peaked at $0.0027 on May 29.

From there it has been a downhill battle for HOT with the forfeiture of the 38.2 percent retracement line opening up the neutral pivot point at $0.0018 (50 percent retracement).

If prices continue to falter, buying pressure is likely to support HOT near $0.0016 due to it being a previous resistance zone.

On Sunday, just after we published our last edition of this weekly update, BTC shot up to $8,800, breaking out of a triangle formation that had bulls’ downfall for the better part of three weeks. While the bullish momentum has since tapered, with the cryptocurrency falling to $5,550, many are still decidedly bullish.

In a recent segment on Bloomberg TV, Jehan Chu of Kenetic Capital explained that BTC could rally by 230% into the end of the year. Chu chalked up this prediction to the fact that Silicon Valley and Wall Street are FOMOing in; the block reward reduction for Bitcoin is now less than one year out; and investors are looking for riskier plays, like digital assets.

Despite the clearly bullish momentum, we’ve seen some, like Mike Novogratz, claim that Bitcoin is either poised for a drawdown or a bout of consolidation. Per previous reports from NewsBTC, the former Wall Street investor suggested that BTC is likely to consolidate between “$7,000 and $10,000” from here, adding that “trees don’t grow to the sky” in an evident attempt to hint that the crypto market may be overbought.

Price action aside, the industry continued to trudge forward. This week, however, was a bit slower than normal. Regardless, we still saw a number of interesting developments. Let’s take a closer look, shall we?

Crypto Tidbits

Bitcoin Blender Bites The Dust Following Regulatory Concerns: Bitcoin Blender, a mixer for cryptocurrency that obfuscates the receiver and sender of transactions, has shut down its business, per The Bleeping Computer. An announcement was given on short notice to give users of the platform the ability to withdraw their funds, but some may not have been able to withdraw their BTC in time. This news comes a week after BestMixer, one of Blender’s rivals, fell victim to a shut down by the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD). According to Europol’s press release, “Bestmixer.io was one of the three largest mixing services for cryptocurrencies and offered services for mixing the cryptocurrencies bitcoins, bitcoin cash and litecoins.” The platform purportedly processed over $200 million in the past 12 months before its collapse.

Forbes: Billionaire Seeking To Secure 25% Of All BTC In Circulation: According to a recent report from Forbes, the Dadiani Syndicate, a little-known yet key firm in the cryptocurrency market, purportedly has a large request to fill. The group, which touts itself as an investment “platform for […] maximizing your digital holdings”, is much like an over-the-counter (OTC) desk, but with a likely much larger influence. The founder of the firm, art dealer Eleesa Dadiani, tells Forbes that one of her billionaire clients recently said they were interested in “acquiring 25% of all Bitcoin currency available”, adding that she knows of “entities” looking to take the reins of the crypto bull. Per estimates, this would require the investor/group to put $38 billion forward at current valuations.

Large Holders Stacking Cryptocurrency In Hopes Of Bull Run: In a similar string of news, trade publication Diar recently revealed that “firm size” addresses are accumulating BTC at a rapid pace. In fact, they wrote that addresses that hold 1,000 to 10,000 BTC now hold 26% of all coins, up from 20% in Q3 of 2018. These addresses, which have added 100,000 BTC to their stacks in the first six months of 2019, confirm that “smart money” is accumulating and preparing for the next bull rally.

Coinbase Is Considering Margin Trading, Following Binance’s Footsteps: During a recent edition of “The Scoop”, trade publication The Block’s podcast, a Coinbase executive divulged some company secrets about its intent to dive into margin (leverage) trading. Emilie Choi, the vice president of business and data at Coinbase, noted that conversations have begun in regards to launching the feature. Choi elaborated:

“Margin, lend, borrow is definitely going to be a next big step for us, especially on the active trader side.” There are some concerns, however, as margin platforms have long been banned in the United States, where Coinbase is based. In fact, BitMEX once suspended the U.S.-based analyst Tone Vays, whose income was then somewhat derived from the platform’s commission system. A move into this subsector may be important for the exchange though. The Block suggested in early-2019 that Coinbase’s revenue could fall by up to 55% over 2019, making a new facet of business almost mandatory. More importantly, the margin space has proven to be quite profitable. As Fundstrat’s Tom Lee suggested late last year, BitMEX likely made $1.2 billion in fiscal 2018, outclassing most startups in the Bitcoin and crypto asset ecosystem.

Choi elaborated: Samsung May Integrate Digital Asset Support, Local Media Writes: Reported by Business Korea last week, Samsung may soon integrate cryptocurrencies in some capacity into its Pay network, which is an e-commerce/fintech platform that sports over ten million active users. This would allow for the payment ecosystem to cut intermediaries out of the equation, thereby making payments faster and cheaper. Interestingly, however, the report did not mention if Samsung is considering adding its own coin or something like Ethereum. Samsung Pay purportedly constitutes more than 80% of South Korea’s payment market, making it much like the WeChat Pay of the nation. The outlet chalks this postulation to the fact that the Seoul-based company recently allocated resources from its blockchain task force to its service business division. This would be huge, as it would normalize the usage of digital currencies, making it that much easier for consumers to get into Bitcoin.

The data was revealed in a Chainalysis webinar attended by Cointelegraph on May 30.

A ransomware attack involves the infection of a target with malware and the demand of a ransom payment — frequently denominated in cryptocurrencies. The payment is demanded in return for the ostensible delivery of a decryptor tool that can help victims recover access to their data.

Chainalysis — which provides blockchain analytics tools that enable firms, governments and law enforcement to monitor blockchain transactions and track suspected illicit activities — claims that 64% of ransomware attackers launder their ill-gotten funds via crypto exchanges.

Chainalysis has ostensibly identified 38 exchanges — without disclosing their names — that directly received funds from an address associated with a ransomware attack.

Among other ransomware cash-out strategies analyzed, 12% involved mixing services and 6% involved peer-to-peer networks, while others went via merchant services providers or dark web marketplaces. 9% of ransomware proceeds reportedly remain unspent.

The analysis also noted that ransomware attacks typically involve less complex cash-out networks as compared with crypto exchange hacks. Chainalysis argued that this is because a hack often involves a large amount of money leaving a known exchange, often attracting high media publicity, and requiring that hackers conceal the flow of funds more robustly.

By contrast, ransomware campaigns typically involve smaller discrete sums to multiple addresses and are ostensibly less publicized, thereby avoiding intense, immediate scrutiny.

In addition to cash-out strategies, Chainalysis also identified a shift in the ransomware threat landscape. Previous trends, according to the firm, had been to conduct wide and shallow attacks — infecting a large amount of indeterminate victims and seeking small amounts as a ransom to decrypt files. Recent trends, however, indicate that criminals are shifting to targets with legally or politically sensitive data, as well as raising the amount of ransom payment demanded.

As recently reported, Coveware’s Q1 2019 Global Ransomware Marketplace report revealed that bitcoin (BTC) continues to account for the lion’s share — 98% — of crypto-denominated ransomware payments. The report, echoing Chainalysis’ claims, found that the average sum demanded had risen 89% from a median $6,733 in Q4 2018 to $12,762 in Q1 2019.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-whats-up-with-the-crypto-wallet/,"Samsung Galaxy S10 – What’s Up With the Crypto Wallet?

Samsung’s new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S10, had one of the most anticipated premieres this year. The launch of the high-end lineup, comprising three models, marked the 10th anniversary of the Galaxy S series, considered a benchmark in the Android world. A slew of new features were introduced for the latest model. However, the one addition that sparked great interest in the crypto community – the Samsung Blockchain Wallet – is not available to many S10 users, and where it is included, it doesn’t store bitcoin.

Flagship Smartphone That Stores Private Keys

It’s been almost a year since the Korean electronics giant published an article on its Insights platform explaining “why smartphones have the best security for blockchain and cryptocurrency.” In the blogpost, IT consultant and security expert Joel Snyder argued that crypto wallets installed on mobile devices are better suited for storing digital assets than computers. That’s because smartphones utilize what’s called a Trusted Execution Environment. The TEE has a separate memory and persistent storage, completely isolated from the rest of the device. The operating system, Android in this case, is unable to reach into the TEE even when it’s compromised.

“The only way to get to and from the TEE is with an API that calls small applications running in the TEE ‘trustlets.’ With a properly written wallet that uses trustlets to manage the keys, security is seriously tight,” Snyder insisted. If the wallet is stored on a PC hard disk or if the developer chooses to store the private keys on the phone’s regular internal storage, there’s little protection against malware. However, if the keys are in the TEE and only accessible via a trustlet, the malware will not be able to extract them directly, the security expert pointed out. Samsung’s own Knox mobile security platform adds another layer of protection, according to Snyder.

Rumors that the new Galaxy S10 would incorporate a secure feature allowing the storage of crypto keys appeared long before its launch. They were reinforced by leaked images in January showing an app called Samsung Blockchain Keystore in the Galaxy S10 menu which, according to its description, allows you to secure and manage your blockchain private keys. In February, when the new flagship phone was released, Samsung revealed it came with “secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services.”

No Bitcoin in the Samsung Wallet

The official announcement, which was dated Feb. 21, 2019 and tagged “Korea, UK, USA,” did not provide any more details about the crypto wallet that was supposed to be integrated into the new devices. That’s despite Samsung’s decision to file a trademark in the United Kingdom titled “Samsung Crypto Wallet” back in December, 2018. Meanwhile, previous reports that the wallet would support major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BCH, ETH and ERC20 tokens were dismissed as speculation.

As a result, there’s been some confusion among Samsung fans and crypto enthusiasts regarding the availability of the Blockchain Keystore in different markets. According to reviews, forum threads and some of Samsung’s own press releases, the feature is available on devices in the U.S., Canada and South Korea. News.Bitcoin.com confirmed that phones sold in the U.S. have it, but a video review from March suggests that it may not be present on all devices in America. Generally, the keystore can be found in the Settings menu, under Biometrics and Security. The crypto wallet itself has to be activated.

Another video review shows an Enjin wallet installed on the Korean version of the Galaxy S10. To set it up, you need to launch the application, click “Samsung Wallet” and accept the terms and conditions. Once you do that, you’ll be welcomed to the Samsung Blockchain Keystore where you need to agree with its terms and proceed by clicking “Start” to launch the wallet. Then you’ll have two options: either import an existing cryptocurrency wallet or create a new one.

The Samsung Enjin Wallet supports ETH, ENJ, BNT, KNC, the Binance token (BNB), an ethereum-based ERC20 token called “wrapped bitcoin” (WBTC) as well as a couple of stablecoins, true USD (TUSD) and USD coin (USDC). There’s also an integrated exchange feature where more coins and tokens are available. Unfortunately, neither bitcoin cash (BCH) nor bitcoin core (BTC) can be seen among the supported cryptocurrencies.

European crypto enthusiasts seem to be excluded from the privileged crypto club at this stage. Devices sold in Sweden don’t have the Blockchain Keystore or the Samsung Wallet preinstalled, news.Bitcoin.com found out. A thread in Samsung’s EU community support channel suggests that the built-in blockchain wallet is not available in the U.K. either, and the app cannot be downloaded from the Galaxy Store. A moderator with the nick TracyR explains that the Samsung Blockchain Keystore is only available in the U.S., Canada and Korea, adding “There is no news currently [mid-April] if this will be available in the U.K.”

User guides for Galaxy S10, S10e and S10+, prepared for various other countries in Europe and elsewhere, do not contain instructions on how to activate the crypto wallet feature. Where it’s available and if it’s not preinstalled, you should be able to download it from the Galaxy Store. The same applies to the Samsung Blockchain Wallet application. If you manage to get it, while creating a new wallet you will be asked to provide a PIN before Samsung generates a 12-word recovery phrase for you. This may sound like a unique feature but it’s just like any other mobile crypto wallet available in the Google Play store.

According to available information, the Samsung wallet supports ETH and ethereum-based tokens. The option that allows you to import an existing wallet is also for ethereum wallets. It remains unclear whether and when other major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash and bitcoin core will be added. That’s despite a presentation of the S10’s blockchain features during the Samsung Mobile Business Summit earlier this year clearly showing the Bitcoin logo. News.Bitcoin.com contacted the Samsung Newsroom to find out more about the availability of the phone’s crypto features in different markets and obtain a full list of the supported coins. By press time, there has been no reply to our query.

Talk of More Blockchain in Galaxy, Coins in Samsung Pay

Reports this month suggest that Samsung plans to further invest in expanding and developing the blockchain package. Despite the limited availability of the Keystore and the lack of support for Bitcoin, the Korean conglomerate may bring its crypto wallet to more Galaxy devices. Chae Won-cheol, managing director of product strategy at Samsung’s Wireless Business Division, said in an article published on the Korean page of the Samsung Newsroom that the electronics giant will “lower barriers to new experiences” by offering more phones with blockchain functions and expanding the list of countries where the service is available. Without revealing details, the company representative added that Samsung will also work with telecom operators to activate other related technologies such as blockchain-based identification and introduce support for local currencies.

Last week, the Business Korea portal reported on Samsung’s decision to transfer its Blockchain Task Force from the Mobile Business Division, which is behind the development of the Blockchain Keystore and the Samsung Wallet, to the Service Business Division. The latter is responsible for the implementation of key features and the development of core applications in the Galaxy smartphones, including the mobile wallet and payment service Samsung Pay. One of the possible outcomes of this internal reorganization is the integration of decentralized cryptocurrencies into Samsung Pay which, according to the publication, accounts for 80% of the South Korean simple payment market. Once again, what, where and when are questions that Samsung owes answers to.

The research was released by crypto news outlet The Block on May 31. The study shows that 24.5% of the total traffic directed to crypto exchanges originates in the U.S. Japan came in second, with 10% of the total traffic, while South Korea got about 6.5% and Indonesia about 4.5%.

Still, as The Block points out, some countries — for instance China — block access to cryptocurrency exchanges and users from those places usually access them through Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). VPNs mask users’ IP addresses, making them appear as if they were from another country, decreasing the accuracy of this study.

Lastly, The Block claims to have noticed a positive correlation between gross domestic product per capita and the volume of internet traffic directed towards cryptocurrency exchanges. The report noted:

“Data shows poorer countries aren’t trading crypto as much as wealthier countries.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, American crypto investment manager Bitwise Asset Management released a paper claiming that fake trading volumes by crypto exchanges do not impact bitcoin’s (BTC) price.

Earlier this month, news broke that Japan’s Financial Services Agency is reportedly cracking down on crypto exchanges that offer anonymous transactions or have weak identity verification practices in preparation for inspection by the Financial Action Task Force this fall.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/does-kik-stand-a-chance-against-the-goliath-of-the-sec-in-a-us-court,"It’s difficult to fight progress. Although, if you're the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), you can at least try, which could explain why the agency has so far refrained from producing clear and favorable cryptocurrency regulation. Since February 2018, the SEC has taken to consider all initial coin offerings (ICOs) as being securities. Meanwhile, in June 2018, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton proclaimed that the commission is ""not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security that has worked for a long time.""

And given that the SEC has closed down its fair share of ICOs, it would seem there's little hope that it's going to provide any special treatment for crypto and propose lenient guidelines or regulation for the industry. Still, there is at least one company operating within crypto that believes such a scenario is possible.

On May 28, it emerged that the creators of the kin cryptocurrency, the Kik platform, had launched what it calls the Defend Crypto fund. Establishing the new fund with an endowment of $5 million, Kik is calling on sympathetic members of the crypto community to donate cryptocurrencies, in case the initial $5 million isn't sufficient to negotiate with the SEC and possibly ""take them on in court.""

However, while there's little doubt that Kik is absolutely serious about the possibility of fighting it out against the SEC in a legal setting, history suggests that the SEC won’t be budged from its view that kin is a security. But even if the two parties do eventually go to court, the legal opinion Cointelegraph obtained suggests that Kik has a good case, and that the commission should think very carefully before proceeding with any legal action.

A brief history lesson

Back in September 2017, Kik was able to raise almost $100 million in a ""token distribution event"" (i.e., an ICO) for its kin cryptocurrency, placing it in the top-10 biggest token sales of that year. However, in January 2018, rumors emerged that the SEC had begun investigating the sale, with the commission apparently sending inquiries and one subpoena to the Canadian company (something that has now been confirmed by Kik’s CEO, Ted Livingston).

These inquiries gradually grew in number over the course of 2018, in parallel with the SEC's mounting interest toward ICOs in general. While everything was kept largely under wraps and there were no significant news reports at the time (beyond various pieces of speculation on Reddit), the SEC issued Kik with eight subpoenas between March and July 2018 — and between August and November of the same year, it demanded nine testimonies from members of the Kik team. This was all capped off on Nov. 16, when the SEC issued Kik with a Wells notice, indicating that it would begin enforcement action against the firm, pending approval by commissioners.

As the Wells notice sent by the SEC makes clear, Kik had potentially violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the 1933 Securities Act, which prohibit the sale of securities that haven't been registered with the commission.

Of course, in its response to this letter, Kik strongly refuted any violations, affirming that ""Kin is exempt from the federal securities laws"" because it ""possesses all the characteristics of a currency like Bitcoin and Ether."" In other words, its line was that kin isn't a security but rather a currency or a utility token, while its token sale did not fall whatsoever under the description of an ""investment contract.""

In fact, Kik's 30-page response to the Wells notice was so confident (if not aggressive) that it closed on a defiant tone, with its hired counsel, Patrick E. Gibbs, concluding, “Should the Commission choose to file an enforcement action, Kik and the Kin Foundation are prepared to litigate and are confident that they will prevail in court."" This exchange of letters was then followed by a variety of discussions and negotiations between the two parties at the beginning of 2019, with the SEC also requesting further information and documents from Kik.

Since then, the only thing that's happened is that, according to Defend Crypto's website, the SEC extended its Wells notice deadline to some time in May. This was done in order to give the commission additional time to decide and vote on whether to actually take enforcement action. This seems to have displeased Kik, as the messaging app company has responded by publicizing the Defend Crypto fund while explaining to the media on May 16 that it has so far spent $5 million on going back-and-forth with the SEC.

Why the Defend Crypto initiative?

Livingston revealed in a podcast on May 28 that the Defend Crypto fund has been launched not so much to cover the expenses Kik has run up so far, but to help it launch its own legal case against the SEC. The Kik CEO went on to say:

""The continued challenge for us has been the lack of clarity on the regulatory side, and so over the last year and a half, we've also been working with the SEC. [...] Then, when they started to ask us for some comments and some meetings [...] to understand crypto, to create that clear guidance we all need. And after spending 18 months and over $5 million trying to work with them, we just continue to be super frustrated by the lack of clarity [...] and so we've put together defendcrypto.org, and what that's saying is that the only way we're going to get clarity is if somebody goes to court, and so we are prepared to do that.""

As Livingston went on to add, Kik and the industry in general need ""a new Howey test,"" so that future cryptocurrency projects can hold token sales without having to worry about whether they should be registered with the SEC or not. More importantly, ""that new Howey test is going to come from a ruling in a court case,"" which is why Kik and the Kin Foundation have launched Defend Crypto — and which is why Kik is prepared to take the SEC to court if the SEC doesn't take them to court first.

What are the chances of success?

It's worth pointing out at this juncture that the SEC has only ever issued one “no-action” letter in its short history of scrutinizing ICOs, a letter that arrived in April and was addressed to TurnKey Jet concerning its TKJ utility tokens. Casual observers would therefore be forgiven for assuming that Kik doesn't have much of a chance when it comes to either changing the SEC's mind, or winning a legal case.

However, while there isn't a clear conviction that Kik will prevail, certain figures within the crypto industry have welcomed its actions, indicating at least a willingness to believe it has a chance.

Jake Chervinsky, a lawyer who currently serves as general counsel for decentralized money market Compound, tweeted:

This is the most important storyline in the world of crypto securities law in 2019; far more significant than any SEC guidance or proposed legislation. The SEC keeps saying digital tokens are securities, but can they prove it in court? Respect to Kik for their aggressive stance. https://t.co/Csh8viwijj — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) May 28, 2019

Likewise, Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano hosted Livingston on his “Off the Chain” podcast on May 30, and while he arguably spent much of the show playing devil's advocate to Livingston's arguments, he concluded by saying, ""I think that there are a lot of people who are paying attention to what you guys are doing, and frankly cheering for you guys to help get some clarity.""

Kik believes it has a chance, clarifying its position on whether Kik is a security in an extensively detailed response to the SEC's Wells notice and on the Defend Crypto website. In particular, it lists a number of reasons why it believes kin isn't a security, starting with the fact that kin is currently used by around 300,000 Kik users as a currency within the Kik ecosystem, making it one of the most-used cryptos in terms of transactions per 24 hours, as of writing. Because it's used in an ecosystem, this should qualify it first and foremost as a utility token, in Kik's opinion, and as it notes in its response to the Wells notice, ""The industry understood the DAO Report to stand for the proposition that token sales with ‘specific utility […] to software or a platform’ likely do not require registration.""

Related to this, Kik also argue that, like Ethereum (which isn’t a security), kin was always intended to become a decentralized cryptocurrency that wouldn't be managed or overseen by Kik, but rather by its distributed community of developers and users.

“Kik stressed that Kin would ‘serve as a foundation for a decentralized ecosystem of digital services.’ (SEC Ex. 88.) By providing an open and decentralized network of digital services, the Kin ecosystem would ‘foster direct economic relationships between developers, creators, and consumers, with value and governance shared among the participants,’” it wrote in the Wells letter, and what's interesting about this is that it echoes what the SEC's William Hinman had said at a summit in June 2018, when it was reported that the commission had decided Ethereum was not a security:

""Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.""

SEC Chairman Clayton seconded these views in March, in a letter to U.S. Rep. Ted Budd:

""A digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract if, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Under those circumstances, the digital asset may not represent an investment contract under the Howey framework.""

As Clayton's reasoning implies, the ""essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts"" on which the exchange and transmission of ETH is based is no longer carried out by a centralized party. As such, it could no longer be classed as a security, which would explain why Ethereum hasn't faced any kind of SEC enforcement action, despite benefitting from an $18.4 million ICO in 2014.

Lastly, there's also Kik's assertion that the kin token sale did not satisfy the criteria of an ""investment contract"" as defined in the Howey test, which states that such a contract is any ""transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party."" As Kik's counsel, Gibbs writes on its behalf, the kin token sale (or presale) doesn't qualify as an investment contract ""because no common enterprise exists between Kik and/or the Kin Foundation, on the one hand, and Kin purchasers, on the other hand.""

Put simply, kin holders don't have any stake or ownership interest in Kik as a company, and neither do they have any claims to Kik's future profits or assets. Kik also argues that, just because kin holders stand to benefit from any increase in the currency's value, this doesn't qualify as a common enterprise: ""Simply owning a common asset whose value rises and falls depending on market forces does not give rise to a ‘common enterprise’ for purposes of Howey. See Woodward v. Terracor, 574 F.2d 1023, 1025 (10th Cir. 1978).""

Win or lose, will crypto be better off regardless?

While it’s hard to provide a decisive prediction of what exactly will now happen between Kik and the SEC, legal opinion would agree that Kik has a pretty solid case, at least in terms of obtaining a favorable judgment on kin’s status. Benjamin J. Sauter, a lawyer with Kobre & Kim, said:

“At the moment, it’s unclear whether Kik will be asserting an affirmative claim against the SEC. [...] In most cases, companies will wait to see if the SEC follows through on the threat to bring an enforcement action. Either way, Kik has put forward some credible arguments thus far, so the SEC will bear legitimate risk if it decides to follow through with an enforcement action.”

Nonetheless, even if Kik isn’t being overly ambitious in challenging the SEC, it's still highly uncertain as to whether any case would result in a new Howey test for crypto in general. David H. McGill, also of Kobre & Kim, told Cointelegraph:

“If the goal here is to overturn the Howey test or render it broadly inapplicable to tokens, I don’t think that is very realistic. But if the goal is to get a court to agree that, under the particular facts and circumstances at issue, KIN tokens don’t constitute securities, I think Kik has a reasonable chance of achieving that outcome, which can then serve as foothold for other token issuers to push back against the SEC.”

These encouraging judgments aside, it still needs to be remembered that, in the past, the SEC has taken enforcement actions on the basis of evidence that investors believed they would benefit from “an increase in value of the tokens.” Because this also likely applies (at least to an extent) in the case of Kik, it’s possible that the commission could behave similarly, even if Kin is already more decentralized than other cryptos.

Even so, because Kik has already spent so much care setting out its case and has now taken things a step further with Defend Crypto. But, Benjamin Sauter believes that the overall legal process may not take as long as some might fear. “Of course, even in a scenario where Kik waits for the SEC to file, Kik would have opportunities to seek an early exit ramp in the form of a motion to dismiss the case, which could help shorten an otherwise lengthy proceeding.”

Yet, win or lose, Kik has taken an important step in confronting the SEC so openly — by expressing grievance with how long it has taken the governing body to reach an enforcement decision and with how the commission's lack of clarity has been damaging the American crypto industry.

This could potentially goad the regulator into finally producing some clear, unequivocal ruling on how to classify cryptocurrencies that have been distributed via a token sale. And if the company does indeed follow through with the initiative and actually sues the SEC, then it's very likely that such a ruling would be produced by a United States court, regardless of the outcome.",,https://www.designboom.com/architecture/post-jcpoa-tower-crypto-park-water-theme-park-cryptocurrency-mining-tehran-iran-06-01-2019/,"for an entry to the 2019 evolo skyscraper competition, a team of designers have envisioned the ‘post – JCPOA tower: crypto-park’ in response to U.S sanctions on iran. imagined for a site on top of the abbas abbad hill in tehran, the project proposes to create a cryptocurrency mining tower under the cover of a secondary function – a water theme park. in face of a struggling economy, the design intends to offer an alternative solution to bypass the strict sanctions that have been placed upon the country.

the design team – composed of ilia attarpour, dadbeh mohebbi gilani, ramtin taherian, nashid nabian and behzad khorram – has imagined the tower to rise above the city at an impressive height of 1837 ft (560 meters). the structure of the tower is left somewhat exposed by glazed façades, allowing spectators to see the flumes and swimming pools that make up the leisure park. underneath this infrastructure, the design houses a hidden hi-tech facility that is intended to mine crypto-currencies, day in, day out and all year long.

creating an unforgettable image on the landscape of tehran, the tower aims to be a symbol of resistance against the international politics that has placed sanctions and embargoes upon the country. by adopting a very radical approach, the project aims to convey the problems facing iran’s economy, not only to emphasize the current social climate but also to explore the subjects which architecture can tackle and provide fresh solutions for.

“We think a large number of people will obtain crypto not by buying it or mining, but by earning it,” Balaji S. Srinivasan, the recently departed chief technology officer of Coinbase, said on behalf of his former employer at a Block.one event on Saturday night in Washington, D.C.

Srinivasan was on stage alongside Tim Wagner, Coinbase’s vice president of engineering, to announce the addition of EOS to the Earn roster. Formed after Coinbase’s acquisition of Earn.com, which Srinivasan founded, Earn allows users to get cryptocurrency rewards for learning about various protocols.

EOS joins XLM, ZEC, BAT and ZRX in the Earn program, which recently expanded to 103 countries. Coinbase says it has over $100 million worth of crypto available for its customers to earn through the Earn site.

A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the new EOS feature is now live.

“Behind the scenes of EOS showing up on our platform, Coinbase does deep analysis,” Wagner told a crowd of several hundred EOS fans at the Block.one event in D.C. (The Earn news was the undercard of the night’s main event: Block.one’s announcement of a new social media platform called Voice.)

EOS first appeared on Coinbase Pro in April and then on its consumer product as of yesterday. The addition of the token comes after Coinbase said last September that it would add new cryptocurrencies more quickly, releasing at the time a new listing process for crypto assets.

Coming soon, Wagner said, EOS would go live on Coinbase Custody as well.

Wagner told the crowd:

“For any of us to succeed, crypto must succeed.”

The EOS price is trading at $7.81 as of press time, according to CoinMarketCap, down from a high earlier on Saturday of $8.29.

Are you looking for a secure way to buy Bitcoin online? Start by downloading your free Bitcoin wallet from us and then head over to our Purchase Bitcoin page where you can easily buy BCH and BTC.",2019-06-02 10:36:17+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-overnight-crash-doesnt-stop-experts-from-remaining-macro-bullish,"On May 30, overnight, the valuation of the crypto market dropped by $19 billion as the price of bitcoin (BTC) briefly dropped from $9,000 to $8,000 — a staggering 11% within a few hours on exchanges like Bitstamp. The drop of bitcoin to $8,000 was not visible on charts of market data providers like CoinMarketCap because the movement occurred in a short time frame.

Bitcoin’s price immediately recovered to $8,300 following its abrupt decline, relieving some of the pressure from the rest of the crypto market and continues to rise in price as of press time.

Despite the $1,000 decline in the price of bitcoin on May 30, the asset has performed strongly against the U.S. dollar throughout the past month.

Ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP and other large market cap crypto assets closed that day with a 9% drop against the United States dollar, while the timely recovery of bitcoin allowed the dominant crypto asset to minimize its drop to about 5%.

Are technical analysts still macro bullish on bitcoin?

Technical analysts in the crypto sector, such as Josh Rager and Cred, foresee $8,200 as a crucial support level that could prevent the asset from dropping to the $7,000 region once again.

The last time bitcoin’s price dropped below $7,000 was in a flash crash on March 17, when it fell to $6,400, triggered by the unexpected sell-off of 5,000 BTC on Bitstamp, which then led to the mass liquidation of contracts on BitMEX.

Bitcoin has since demonstrated strong momentum, with signs of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) among investors, creating a vertical rally to the upside.

Cred told Cointelegraph in an interview that, as long as the $8,200 support level is defended, a rise to $9,600 remains a realistic target and a high time frame resistance level.

“I think the vertical rally is more a sign of FOMO and disbelief as opposed to something to be inherently concerned about. I’m looking at the $9600 area as the next high time frame resistance area if price trades higher. Closer to current price (which is pulling back at the time of writing), I think losing $8200 — the level price broke out from and thus nearest support — will take us to the $7300 area. Mid $6000s remains the best and final area for longs. Losing that level and staying below $6000s would shift my bias to bearish.”

In the past month, within a 30-day span, the price of bitcoin has increased from $5,322 to over $8,700 by a staggering 54%.

Still, based on the historical performance of bitcoin and its tendency to see a major correction in the tune of 30% to 40% following a large spike in price, Cred noted that a 30% drop in the future remains a possibility.

Throughout the past three years, bitcoin has generally shown sustainable momentum, especially from 2016 to late 2017. However, it was regularly prone to relatively corrections in short time frames.

“In 2017 and years before that, Bitcoin would regularly correct circa 30% before continuing higher. I think we will see something similar, but trying to short this market presumptively is a bad play. Any significant pullback above the old $6000 floor is a dip I’m interested in buying, the closer to $6000 the better,” Cred said.

Potential catalysts of bitcoin

It remains to be seen whether there are sufficient fundamental catalysts on the horizon that would push bitcoin’s price above $9,000 and potentially to $10,000, considering the lack of resistance above $9,000.

The following factors have been mentioned in recent weeks as potential catalysts for an increase in bitcoin’s price:

Rise in institutional demand, as seen in the drastic increase in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) premium. The entrance of major financial institutions such as Fidelity, Etrade and TD Ameritrade. Scheduled block reward halving of bitcoin in May 2020. A noticeable improvement in the infrastructure supporting the asset class. Rising institutional demand, triggering the recovery of retail interest.

On May 30, at its weekly peak, the price of a share of GBTC, a publicly listed investment vehicle operated by Digital Currency Group’s Grayscale that enables investors to invest in bitcoin through a stock market in OTC Markets, hit $12.40.

Every share of GBTC represents 0.00098247 BTC. As such, at $12.40 a share, the price of bitcoin on over-the-counter (OTC) markets essentially hit $12,182, trading with nearly a 40 percent premium.

In its Q1 2019 report, Grayscale emphasized that the majority of investments in its products, including GBTC, came from institutional investors, which was at 73%.

“Institutional investors comprised the highest percentage of total demand for Grayscale products in the first quarter (73%). This was also consistent with their share of inflows over the trailing twelve months (73%). As we have mentioned in previous reports, many institutional investors may view the current drawdown as an attractive entry point to add to their core positions in digital assets.”

The overall increase in confidence and improvement of sentiment around the crypto market have also led the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain to achieve a 2019 high of 59 exahash, nearing its all-time high of 60 exahash that was reached in September 2019.

As the price rises and mining becomes more profitable, the hash rate supporting the Bitcoin blockchain is expected to rise continuously in the near term, which could be considered a positive indicator for stability.

Moreover, as Cred said, the momentum of bitcoin in recent months could have simply been primarily fueled by speculation rather than fundamental catalysts. Hence, it is possible that the sheer rise in demand among investors in the broader market pushed the crypto market.

“As facetious as this response may seem, price rallied due to an imbalance between buyers and sellers (the former being dominant). The market is trending hard. Typically in strong trends, consolidation (as was the case before the breakout) leads to continuation. One can speculate over ‘causes’ for a move in price but it’s often just that; speculation.”

Is a strong correction still due?

Speaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency technical analyst and trader Josh Rager said that a strong correction in the crypto market is still due.

Similar to Cred, Rager stated that, based on technicals, bitcoin’s price could push above $9,000 and rise up to $9,400. However, the analyst noted that traders have shown a willingness to take profits in the early $9,000 region, which could lead to correction if BTC achieves a new yearly high in the near term:

“If Bitcoin can hold and close above $8200 on the daily chart there is hope that it could continue to push up to $9400+ but I still believe that a strong correction is due. “And at this time after the distribution pattern in upper $8ks, the spring above $9,000 with sharp downturn would be a clear sign to me that people have started taking profit prior to the $9400+ level. Everyone was watching $9400+ to start taking profit and because of this, the move came early and it seems that many were front run by whales.”

In the short term, depending on the ability of bitcoin to defend on important support levels, Rager said that there exists a possibility of the asset plunging to $7,000, if it loses momentum and sees a steep sell-off.

While traders generally foresee a strong drop in the price of bitcoin if it struggles to float above $8,000, opinions differ as to the extent the asset would fall if it falls below $8,000.

Some have suggested that the strength of the momentum of bitcoin may make it highly unlikely to see $7,000 again in the upcoming weeks. Rager added:

“Many were waiting to buy at $3k and below, and the price moved up from $3100 as buyers stepped in prior. Many were waiting for confirmation in the low $6ks and price ripped right through resistance, surprising many as it went to $7k. “And now we see it again as many were waiting to take profits above $9400 and price quickly broke down as large volume selling put pressure on the price as we currently wait to see if Bitcoin will indeed continue to break down to at least the low $7ks with a possibility of pushing all the way down to $5700.”

Industry executives have become more optimistic

The rise of sentiment around bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has led industry executives, particularly exchange operators, to become more upbeat regarding the short- to medium-term trend of the market.

Cameron Winklevoss, a co-founder at major U.S. crypto exchange Gemini, expressed optimism toward the trend of the asset in a tweet:

We talk about going to Mars all the time. We have no limits to our imagination when it comes to space travel. But when it comes to the future of money, curiously many suffer from an acute failure of imagination. The Bitcoin rocket ship is fueling up, make sure to book your seat! — Cameron Winklevoss (@winklevoss) May 30, 2019

On June 1, cryptocurrency enthusiasts were shocked to hear that the peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has ceased offering in-person cash trades. According to a few users, all pending fiat trades have been canceled, leaving local traders who prefer cash high and dry and forced to seek other avenues.

Localbitcoins Ends In-Person Trades Leaving Only Remote Options

One of the oldest over-the-counter BTC exchanges, Localbitcoins, has removed cash trades from its list of options. This means that people cannot use the platform to meet in person and sell BTC for cash or vice versa. Localbitcoins hasn’t officially announced why it removed the option, but a few traders have stated that all in-person cash trades were suddenly canceled. “I logged in and found my ‘in-person’ sell offers were all deleted, and the ‘add new’ prompt now has no ‘local’ options, only ‘online’ ones — Kind of defeats the purpose of ‘local’ in the name,” one trader detailed on the Reddit forum r/bitcoin.

The news spread like wildfire across social media and bitcoiners discussed new ways to trade in-person for cash. Ray Youseff, the founder of the peer-to-peer platform Paxful, noted on Twitter that his platform has started seeing a great number of new registrations.

“Localbitcoins is now Remote Bitcoins — They took down all their cash offers and the refugees are flooding to Paxful VIP support for all cash vendors,” Youseff exclaimed. “We won’t let you down — Cash is still king in the emerging world.”

Sure enough, after logging on to the Localbitcoins site, all local in-person trades have been removed from the drop-down menu. Localbitcoins’ reason for stopping in-person cash trades remains unclear right now and a few other users complained that their cash trades were canceled without any warnings. The removal of cash trades follows the peer-to-peer platform’s recent addition of more KYC requirements for large traders and the operation also ceased serving Iranians. The news also comes two days before the launch of Local.Bitcoin.com, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will allow individuals to trade bitcoin cash (BCH) privately with anyone in the world.

Local.Bitcoin.com Offers Local P2P Trades

Traders can use the peer-to-peer local bitcoin cash marketplace with any payment method and the noncustodial platform also offers great margins for both buyers and sellers. There is a wide variety of online payment methods for people who are trading from a distance, but the BCH marketplace also offers in-person cash trades so people can trade with each other locally. If you are looking for an exchange that provides cash trades in person or if you want to trade by using another form of payment, you can create an account before it launches on June 4.

Creating an account today will allow people to get a feel for the platform and users can start creating sell orders in advance for when the marketplace launches. During the pre-launch over the next 48 hours, users can add profile details like payment method, location, and local currency. People can download a wallet backup to secure future funds and be prepared to do over-the-counter trades effortlessly. Moreover, Local.Bitcoin.com traders can earn through referrals when they invite friends and family members to the BCH marketplace. For instance, if a friend of yours signs up through a referral then you will be rewarded with 20% of their lifetime trading fees.

It’s a shame that Localbitcoins has chosen to stop offering in-person cash trades and the recent changes are sure to leave some traders out in the cold if they prefer to trade in person with cash. The decision may create risk for traders who opt to forgo Localbitcoins’ escrow system and try trading in an unsafe manner either within the platform’s chat messenger or use methods like Craigslist. Without an escrow system, traders can potentially be robbed for their funds. For this reason, peer-to-peer trading platforms with escrow solutions are far more secure and safer to use. When you use Local.Bitcoin.com’s BCH marketplace, the platform offers blind escrow which creates onchain Bitcoin Cash transactions while the funds sit in limbo. It is technically impossible for anyone (including Bitcoin.com) outside of the deal to spend the BCH held in escrow and only the two parties involved can complete the settlement. With Localbitcoins removing in person cash trades, it further emphasizes the need for noncustodial solutions within the growing crypto community.

Venezuela is among those nations where cryptocurrencies enjoy faster adoption. The South American country suffers from a political and economic crisis causing hyperinflation of the national fiat, the bolivar. Coincoin, a mining equipment supplier based in Caracas, is one of many Venezuelan businesses that have decided to accept cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is now among its payment options.

Store Sells Antminers and Appliances for BCH

Just like shovel sellers during the Gold Rush accepted gold nuggets for their tools, Coincoin, which provides modern day cryptocurrency miners with the hardware they need, is readily accepting digital coins. And if in the 19th century, when the money supply was based on the precious metal, the phenomenon spurred economic development in many sectors other than the gold mining industry, the minting of cryptocurrencies could do that in our era.

The Venezuelan company is selling mining devices and accessories in very challenging conditions. The economic meltdown in the country has affected businesses from all industries. The crisis, however, has also turned decentralized cryptocurrencies into a preferred means of payment, exchange and store of value. Cryptos are simply more reliable than the fiat bills which cost less than the paper they were printed on.

Coincoin maintains both a brick and mortar store in Caracas and an online platform where it offers a range of products for cryptocurrency mining, including various Antminer models manufactured by the Chinese giant Bitmain. It also sells video cards that can be used in non-professional mining applications and other parts such as power supplies, cables, cooling fans, racks for mining rigs, and accessories.

The online store is catering to other categories of customers as well. It ships a variety of products including home appliances, TV sets, smartphones, and even toys. All of these items can be purchased using U.S. dollars and euros but also major cryptocurrencies that are popular in Venezuela such as bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin core (BTC) and dash.

If you choose BCH on the home page, all listed products will be priced in bitcoin cash. When you fill up your shopping cart and proceed to the checkout, you’ll be asked for your name, email and shipping address. You can place your order as a guest or create an account with the online store, which is not mandatory. Then you need to choose a shipping method and make a payment. The shopping experience, when using cryptocurrency, is very smooth.

Bitcoin Cash Adoption Grows in Venezuela

Countries experiencing economic hardships and political instability, from Venezuela to Turkey, have become leaders in cryptocurrency adoption, in one way or another. A lot of Venezuelans look at digital coins as a way to preserve and even increase the value of their income. Many businesses rely on cryptos to ensure stable revenues and provide their customers with an attractive payment option.

Bitcoin cash has certain advantages over other cryptocurrencies in that role as it offers very low fees, often less than one U.S. cent, and faster transactions for payments and remittances. According to Bitcoin.com’s Marco Coino app, there are currently over 200 merchants in Venezuela that accept bitcoin cash payments and their number is constantly growing.

Bitcoin.com is engaged in efforts to increase the number of stores in Caracas and other cities that accept BCH for their goods and services. You can also get involved and support the initiative by either donating for Bitcoin.com’s merchant adoption campaign or the charitable organization Eatbch. Another project that will allow Venezuelans and people from around the world to trade bitcoin cash (BCH) on a peer-to-peer basis is Local.Bitcoin.com. The platform will launch on June 4.

What is tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of turning things into digital assets.

Assume you have a farm that is worth $1 million. It has a big barn, cows, rabbits, a hedgehog — you name it. All of a sudden, you are desperately in need of money, you can sell that farm the old way — fill out the paperwork, wait for an offer, close the deal, etc. But what if you need less than $1 million and would prefer to keep most of the farm to yourself?

Imagine digitally printing 1 million tokens under the symbol “COW,” for instance, where each COW is worth exactly 1% of your property — or any other amount, just as long as each token represents a certain share of the underlying asset (in this case, your farm).

Technically speaking, you would be developing an algorithm that would be implemented as a smart contract on a blockchain. This algorithm defines all the features of your future token: its value, quantity, denominations, name, etc.

So, how do we actually get those COW tokens out there so that they can be freely bought and sold on different exchanges? For that, we need a platform that supports smart contracts. Ethereum would be the most popular choice. Rather than getting into the technical details about how tokens are created and getting too far off topic, let’s just say you’ll need a smart contract template, a text editor and an Ethereum wallet address.

Voila, COW tokens are now in circulation! Technically, they are ERC-20 tokens — basically meaning that they are powered by Ethereum blockchain. Now that they have entered the market, their value can either go up or down in accordance with demand.

See how blockchain can allow us to tokenize things now? We took a farm and created its digital representation that exists on a blockchain. In short, this farm is now a tokenized asset.",2019-06-02 10:10:00+01:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-bsv-trx-atom-miota-etc-nexo,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Public trust towards establishments and large corporations has been on a decline. Sheila Warren, head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum, said that if used properly, blockchain technology has the ability to solve this problem.

Wealthier nations trade more cryptocurrencies compared to poorer countries, according to research by crypto news outlet The Block. The United States generates 24.5% of the total traffic directed to cryptocurrency exchanges globally, with 10% to Japan in second place and 6.5% to South Korea in third.

Unlike previous occasions, every dip is presently being viewed as a buying opportunity, which confirms that a new uptrend has started. Cryptocurrencies backed by a positive news flow are skyrocketing higher, which shows a strong bullish sentiment. What do the charts of the top five performers of the past week project? Let’s find out.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin sv (BSV) was the best performer once again as it ended with gains of over 100% in the past seven days. The massive spike in price was attributed to the fake news circulating in Chinese media about Craig Wright having transferred 50,000 bitcoin from the biggest Bitcoin wallet to Binance. As a result, the fake news reports said that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao would publicly apologize and re-list BSV.

While most of the BSV news was taken up by the fake news, in another development, Australian firm Tokenized launched a protocol on the BSV blockchain that can help businesses create tokens for real-world assets. Can the cryptocurrency maintain its upwards move, or will it give up its gains? Let’s find out.

During the week, the BSV/USD pair witnessed huge volatility. It rallied to a high of $254 and then flash crashed to a low of $44.765 on crypto exchange Bitfinex. However, it quickly recovered from the lows and has been trading between $175 and $200 since then. After the sharp rise, we expect the digital currency to become range-bound and consolidate its gains for a few weeks.

On the downside, the cryptocurrency might find support close to $152.015, which is the 50% retracement level of the rally from the recent lows. If this support level cracks, the next zone to watch out for is between $134.360 and $127.947.

On the upside, if the bulls propel the price to new lifetime highs, it can move up to $307.789 and above it to $340.248. However, we give it a low probability of occurring unless we see another leg of a news-based rally.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) had slipped out of the top 10 rankings on CoinMarketCap during the week. But a tweet by founder Justin Sun about a forthcoming major announcement propelled the prices higher. As a result, the digital currency reclaimed its spot in the top 10. Earlier, Tron announced the development of a decentralized file system that will “allow users to receive and host storage on their computers with other individuals and businesses.”

The TRX/USD pair was stuck inside a range for over nine months. After numerous failed breakouts, it has finally sustained the current upwards move. This new uptrend has started after a long stay inside the range. Hence, we expect it to surprise on the upside. The first target to watch out for is $0.052818328, and above this, the pair is likely to pick up momentum.

On the downside, the first support is at $0.02815521. If the cryptocurrency rebounds from this level during the next pullback, it will confirm the breakout as valid and will act as a higher floor on any declines. But if the next correction breaks down from $0.02815521, it will indicate weakness and might extend the stay in the range.

NEXO/USDT*

Nexo (NEXO) claims to be the world’s first instant crypto credit line provider. The firm is present in more than 200 jurisdictions and offers loans in over 45 fiat currencies. Having processed $500 million for more than 200,000 Nexo users, the company will soon launch a Nexo Card, starting with Europe. The card will allow its clients to use the credit limit to buy anything, similar to any other card but with better terms.

Though most of the past year was spent in a crushing bear phase, the company had successfully paid a dividend of $912,071.00 to the NEXO token holders in December 2018. It will announce the ex-dividend date for its next dividend pay-out in June. The month also has other exciting announcements in store for the NEXO token holders. First will be the launch of the NEXO mobile app for both Android and iOS users with its next update. Next, the TRON foundation’s TRX token will be added as a collateral option on the demand of the community.

Nexo is laying the groundwork to retain and build on its leadership position in the forthcoming cryptocurrency boom. It is currently ranked 104 as per CoinMarketCap. While the fundamentals look positive, let’s see what the chart projects.

The NEXO/USD pair has largely been trading inside $0.1029813 and $0.0628250 for the past few months. The attempt by the bears to breakdown found buyers at $0.0502510. This week, the bulls propelled the price above the overhead resistance, but are struggling to sustain it. If the price closes (UTC time frame) above $0.1029813, it might signal the start of a new uptrend that has a target objective of $0.1431376, and above it to $0.1557116.

However, if the price fails to sustain above $0.1029813, it might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks. The pair will weaken on a breakdown of the support zone of $0.0628250-$0.0502510.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) was the third-best performer of the week as it surged on May 30. During the week, Atomic wallet announced that it will add the ATOM token to its new public release. What does the chart project?

As the ATOM/USD pair has a short trading history, we shall use the daily charts to analyze it. The pair broke out of a symmetrical triangle on May 30 and made a new lifetime high at $6.603: this is a bullish sign. The pattern target of the breakout from the triangle is $7.905.

Currently, the digital currency has been finding support close to the previous highs of $5.660, which shows demand at the first support level. After a few days of consolidation, we anticipate the bulls to resume the upwards move towards its target objective. The cryptocurrency will lose momentum if it slips and sustains below the support at $5.660: a fall below $4.8 will invalidate the current breakout and indicate weakness.

MIOTA/USD

Iota (MIOTA), with its release of a new tool dubbed “Coordicide,” has taken a major step towards decentralization of its transaction validation. MIOTA can now be traded over-the-counter on the Cumberland exchange, a DRW company. Can this news help it trade higher over the next few days?

Two weeks ago, the MIOTA/USD pair broke out of the overhead resistance of $0.385033. It thereafter held the retest of the breakout levels from the week before, which is a bullish sign as it confirms $0.385033 as the new floor.

During the week, the cryptocurrency easily scaled above our first target objective of $0.50, but faced some profit booking at higher levels. Its next target objective is a rally to $0.80. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash towards the target; the pair might face some supply close to $0.60, where it might consolidate for a few days before resuming its recovery. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency back below the critical support of $0.385033.

ETC/USD

The developers and contributors at ethereum classic (ETC) could not arrive at a consensus to implement the hard fork, dubbed “Atlantis.” There was some objection regarding one of the 10 proposals, as a result of which the upgrade will go back to the drawing board. In another development, in response to the 51% attack faced in January of this year, the Astor-Network testnet based on ECIP-1059 was implemented. This is likely to safeguard the network from future attacks.

The ETC/USD pair is looking strong. It has resumed its recovery after a week of consolidation and can now move up to $10.040-$11.880 resistance zone, which might act as a stiff hurdle for a few days.

A breakout from the resistance zone can push the price towards $15, and above it to $20. With both the moving averages flattening out, the advantage is gradually shifting from the bears to the bulls.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the overhead resistance zone and plummets below $5.22403.

Brendan Blumer, the 32-year-old CEO at Block.one, revealed during a presentation in Washington, D.C., that the blockchain-enabled open-source software publisher’s new social media network, called Voice, will be deployed on EOS, one of the largest platforms for building decentralized applications (dApps).

Blumer: Existing Social Media Platforms “Designed to Use the User”

According to Blumer, the existing social media platforms such as Facebook are “designed to use their users.” He explained that users’ data, attention, and the content they produce are all quite valuable. However, the crypto entrepreneur pointed out that current social media networks are designed to primarily benefit the platform and their owners and management, and not the user who is actually making meaningful contributions to the platform.

Blumer further noted:

“It’s the platform, not the user, that reaps the reward. By design, they run by auctioning our information to advertisers, pocketing the profit, and flooding our feeds with hidden agendas dictated by the highest bidder. Voice changes that.”

Voice: “A Truly Self-Sustaining Economy of Ideas”

In order to give users more control over their data and also allow them to benefit from the content they produce, the developers at Block.one will launch the new Voice social media network on EOS’ public delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)-based blockchain.

As detailed on Block.one’s official website:

“Voice will cultivate creation, sharing, discovery and promotion of content on social media platforms by real users, not bots and fake accounts. Through a truly self-sustaining economy of ideas, users will directly benefit from their ideas and engagement on the platform.”

“No Hidden Algorithms, No Invisible Interests”

The Voice social media network will be deployed on EOS’ EOSIO protocol-enabled public blockchain and “all interactions on Voice will be public,” Block.one’s blog post noted. This will allow for greater transparency, which will be “a core part” of the user experience (UI) on Voice, the software development firm stated.

Clarifying how all participants on Voice will be treated fairly and given the same opportunities, Block.one’s blog mentioned that:

“Everyone –the user, to contributor, the platform –plays by the same rules. No hidden algorithms, no invisible interests.”

“Uniquely Positioned” to Lead Social Media Revolution?

While the management at Block.one claims they’re “uniquely positioned to lead the social media revolution” as EOS-based dApps reportedly account for 70 percent of all current “blockchain activity”, several prominent members of the crypto community believe that existing social media platforms like Twitter are “already perfect.”

This, according to Tom Shaughnessy, the co-founder at independent digital assets-focused research firm Delphi Digital, who argued that Block.one was again trying to “tack on” another use case for EOS, even though it’s not needed. Shaughnessy, a finance graduate from Rutgers Business School, also mentioned via Twitter that Block.one’s Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Dan Larimer had already founded a blockchain-based social media site, called Steemit.

“All EOS Data At the Whim” of 15 of 21 Block Producers?

Shaughnessy went on to claim that all data being used and generated on the EOS network is at “the whim of 15 of 21 block producers.”

In response to Shaughnessy’s claims, “EOS New York”, a prominent EOS block producer, remarked:

Is this a joke? If this is the announcement, this is the kind of thing the entire blockchain industry is working toward; creating an equitable, decentralized economic system where incentives are aligned across all participant types. This should be championed. — EOS New York (@eosnewyork) May 31, 2019

EOS New York further questioned the Delphi Digital co-founder’s statements by arguing that he never really understood the power of blockchain-based social media networks (in theory).

Going on to point out a legitimate use case for uncensorable distributed ledger technology (DLT)-powered social media sites, the EOS BP stated:

“Do you mean you’ve never seen a single instance of Twitter accounts being simply deleted with no warning, explanation, or recourse?”

No Unique Value Proposition?

Meanwhile, Nathaniel Whittemore, the widely-followed curator of Crypto Twitter’s (CT) “Long Read Sundays”, asserted:

The problem with a possible EOS-based Twitter competitor isn't the ""EOS-based"" but the ""Twitter competitor."" Network effects are enormously powerful. New networks arise not b/c of ideology but b/c some alternative social experience that compels behavior shift. /cont 👇 — Nathaniel Whittemore (@nlw) June 1, 2019

Whittemore also appeared to suggest that the EOS-powered Voice platform would have no unique value propositions. This, as he remarked:

Facebook offered something different.

Instagram offered something different.

Tik Tok offered something different. It's certainly not impossible that a new Twitter-like thing becomes the thing. But it *IS* almost impossible that the reason for switch would be ideology. /2 — Nathaniel Whittemore (@nlw) June 1, 2019

Are “Downsides of Centralization” Really So High?

He continued:

“To date, the risk of deplatforming simply has not outweighed the cost of leaving the network. Whenever we ask whether social network X is susceptible to disruption by a decentralized alternative, we need to ask ‘what downsides of centralization are so high that people would suffer the costs of network exit?’”

He added:

In other words, the value of networks is who is there. ANY new network, no matter how awesome, can't compete on sheer breadth of participation. This means network exits costs are real, and powerful. /5 — Nathaniel Whittemore (@nlw) June 1, 2019

But don’t bet on it overhauling the banking establishment. History tells us revolutions in the financial system are amalgamated into the mainstream as soon as they reach a scale to have systemic impacts.

That’s the view of Andrew Cornell, Managing Editor of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group’s (ANZ) bluenotes portal. “It’s the Catch-22: regulators and policy makers let revolutionaries prosper until the revolution gains enough followers at which time it is forced into the existing state,” he says in a new blog post.

But that doesn’t mean cryptocurrencies will disappear. The architecture has some major attractions, Cornell argues, including the potential to limit fraud with the payment (as opposed to scams which occur between the participants, not in the transfer).

What is salient, however, is the absence of Bitcoin et al from most of the myriad existential discussions of the future of banking. For example, the FSB’s new report on FinTech and market structure in financial services: “Market developments and potential financial stability implications” mentions “crypto” only once – and that in a footnote.

A new report from consultants Celent, “Innovation in Banking and Payments 2019”, runs through the key trends in the field while looking at a model bank of the future. Cryptocurrencies don’t feature.

“Innovation will focus on open banking, customer experience, mobile and digital channels, the cloud and artificial intelligence. Of course cryptocurrencies might feature if, for example, they enhance customer experience and become more efficient in digital banking,” Cornell says.

“But it is difficult to contemplate that happening without crypto gaining far-wider legitimacy with regulators. The always entertaining CB Insights will no doubt have a perspective on crypto but in the meantime its reminder on getting too excited is apposite: “Hi there, for all you public company executives, please note that artificial intelligence mentions have overtaken mentions of blockchain on quarterly earnings calls. Please adjust your corporate strategy accordingly.”",2019-06-02 14:00:48+00:00,https://cryptoslate.com/get-bitcoin-on-your-smartwatch-with-this-lightning-network-app/,"Smartwatch users can now receive bitcoin lightning payments in seconds thanks to the new BlueWallet app.

Developed by BlueWallet, the app allows users to generate a QR code on their watch which someone else can scan with their smartphone to quickly send them payment over the Lightning Network, all with a few quick taps on their smartwatch.

In an interview with CryptoSlate, Nuno Coelho, product and user experience engineer, said the Lightning Network is encouraging developers to come up with innovative products and platforms that would aid the adoption of digital assets such as bitcoin. He said:

“We were not happy with the current status of the wallet market, in particular, the wallet we were using at the time. So we decided to team up on this effort and build the solution we wanted to have.”

While the BlueWallet app is currently in the experimental stages, feedback so far has been positive.

Twitter user JPThor said:

I'm living in the Future 😎 Takes 5-10 seconds to prepare a lightning invoice on my watch Immensely cool work from @bluewalletio @nvcoelho pic.twitter.com/4ftOVL7dKD — JP [ ₿ ⚡️] (@jpthor__) May 6, 2019

Nuno said BlueWallet and other applications being developed on Lightning Network such as Tippin.me (an app that lets you send Lightning Network payments across Twitter in seconds) would help drive the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.

How does BlueWallet work?

A: BlueWallet is a mobile app available for iOS and Android. It works by providing users with an interface to interact with the bitcoin and Lightning Network. It supports different types of wallets for different needs and uses cases, and some features, like the possibility to have flexible fees or full-encryption to make user usage more secure and the experience with bitcoin smoother.

What are the next steps for the product?

A: We will be focused on improving our on chain reliability and experience. At the end of the day, onchain is and will be the most important layer that can’t be dismissed or ignored. Users can expect bech32 native addresses, multisig and batch transaction and the ability to connect their own full nodes to the wallet.

What was the idea that kicked Bluewallet into life?

A: We were not happy with the current status of the wallet market, in particular, the wallet we were using at the time. So we decided to team up on this effort and build the solution we wanted to have.

What is next for the Lightning Network?

A: Lightning is just impressive from an engineering point-of-view and exciting from a “bootstrapping a network” point-of-view. The growth we have seen in one year, it’s something you don’t see many times on your lifetime. In terms of development, every single feature, optimization, and improvement are just gifts that we as a community will take care and make sure they get out there.

How close is crypto and the Lightning Network to becoming a mainstream payment method?

A: I think it is the kind of area where we will never be ready, but when we realize it will be everywhere and everyone will be using it. It’s just inevitable, it is a fascinating technological breakthrough that we can’t stop, avoid, or ignore.

The cryptocurrency founder Justin Sun tweeted that he won the annual charity auction for a lunch with Warren Buffett.

Sun founded the cryptocurrency ""tron"" and paid nearly $4.6 million for the luncheon.

Watch tron trade live.

The cryptocurrency founder Justin Sun announced in a tweet on Monday morning that he had secured a lunch with Warren Buffett after bidding a record $4,567,888 in a charity auction. Sun, who is based in Singapore, is originally from China, where the number ""8"" is known to signify good luck.

The lunch, which is presented by eBay and the Glide Foundation, will be held at the famed steakhouse Smith & Wollensky in New York City. The auction was hosted exclusively on eBay, with final bids due May 31. As in previous years, 100% of the proceeds were donated to the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco-based charity which provides local services to the homeless.

Sun is the founder of the cryptocurrency ""tron,"" which is a top 10 ""crypto network,"" according to Sun's LinkedIn profile. He has also founded Peiwo, a Chinese peer-to-peer communications app, and is a self-described ""protégé"" of Jack Ma, the famed billionaire and founder of Alibaba. Sun graduated from Hupan University, which was founded by Ma, and has reportedly made a donation of $1.5 million to his alma mater.

The cryptobull also tweeted that he would invite other blockchain industry leaders to meet with Buffett, with the hopes that the meeting would ""benefit everyone."" Buffett previously referred to bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, as ""rat poison squared.'

Sun hopes he can shift the billionaire's views on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. ""It is very common in investment circles that people will change their minds,"" he told Bloomberg.

Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger has also strongly criticized digital currencies.

""I think the people who are professional traders that go into trading cryptocurrencies, it is just disgusting,"" Munger said. ""It is like somebody else is trading turds and you decide 'I can't be left out.'""

Munger is not expected to attend the luncheon.

As of current trading, the $4.6 million bid is equivalent to 543.6 bitcoins and 119.3 million trons. There are more than 66 billion trons in circulation, with a total market cap of $2.6 billion at current prices, according to the industry website CoinMarketCap.com.

It is not clear how much tron Sun holds, but a third of the cryptocurrency, worth some $800 million, is not in circulation.

Tron is up more than 100% this year.

Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency TRON and CEO of file-sharing company BitTorrent, had the winning bid at $4.57 million. In an open letter posted on Medium, Sun said he would invite other blockchain industry leaders to dine with the legendary value investor in New York.

TWEET

When asked for comment, Buffett laughed out loud and told CNBC's Becky Quick he was looking forward to the lunch.

Sun said in the letter that he was ""a long-term believer (and certainly a big fan) of Buffett and his long-term value investing strategy,"" adding that ""the long-term value investment strategy and cryptocurrency, in my eyes, are one in the same.""

Based on his comments since 2013, Buffett would probably disagree with that characterization of cryptocurrency. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has labeled the world's first and largest digital currency everything from ""rat poison squared"" to a ""delusion"" that ""attracts charlatans."" Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger has called it a ""turd,"" and said at the annual shareholder meeting that trading cryptocurrencies is ""just dementia.""

They are in good company — Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates, economists Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller, and the fund managers Ray Dalio and Howard Marks have all questioned bitcoin's legitimacy.

Step 3: Choose an appropriate type of analysis

Now that you have decided on the type of trader you wish to become and familiarized yourself with the different internal and external factors affecting the crypto industry, your first step to trading is learning to analyze the crypto market.

It is at this point that you decide whether to employ fundamental analysis or technical analyses in decrypting the impact either of these has on the crypto price action:

Fundamental analysis

Fundamental analysis is an all-inclusive price-determining tool used to determine the price movements of a cryptocurrency and its investment potential.

Ironically though, while the fundamental analysis is aimed at researching and determining the price at which to enter or exit a trade, it involves studying everything else except the price.

Facets of fundamental analysis that you must familiarize with include:

Sentimental analyses: This tests the markets’ general opinion about a certain coin. Ideally, the more positive and optimistic the populace is about a coin, the higher its likelihood of performing well in the near future and vice versa. You can use such sentimental analysis tools as Sentiment Analyzer and Hootsuite Insights. You will also want to concentrate our analyses on high chat-volume platforms like social media as well as such popular sites as Reddit and Quora.

You can use such sentimental analysis tools as Sentiment Analyzer and Hootsuite Insights. You will also want to concentrate our analyses on high chat-volume platforms like social media as well as such popular sites as Reddit and Quora. Major news analyses: You also must always be on the lookout for hints and confirmations of major news and events. These range from partnerships, system upgrades and early detection and fixes of bugs that push the price up; to major hacks, loss of key partners and crypto coin developers that have a negative effect on the price of the coin.

You also must always be on the lookout for hints and confirmations of major news and events. These range from partnerships, system upgrades and early detection and fixes of bugs that push the price up; to major hacks, loss of key partners and crypto coin developers that have a negative effect on the price of the coin. Demand and supply analysis: Mastering the different forces affecting the demand and supply of a crypto coin may easily pass as the most basic aspect of fundamental analyses. But also the most neglected. Most traders are too preoccupied with testing the market sentiments and following news that they forget to monitor the different factors affecting the demand and supply of the coin.

Technical analysis

This refers to forecasting the price action of a specific altcoin based on its past performance. It is also referred to as charting given that all the types of analyses involved here will only take into account the price chart details. Some of the most important technical analyses tools that you must familiarize yourself with if you hope to succeed as a crypto trader include:

Support and resistance: Excelling in technical analysis starts with the mastery of the support and resistance trendlines. Support, in this case, refers to the lowest price level at which the price of a crypto coin refuses to go past. Resistance, on the other hand, refers to the highest level at which the price of a coin hasn’t been able to hop above. These tell you the minimum and maximum price ranges traders are willing to sell and buy the crypto coin respectively.

Support, in this case, refers to the lowest price level at which the price of a crypto coin refuses to go past. Resistance, on the other hand, refers to the highest level at which the price of a coin hasn’t been able to hop above. These tell you the minimum and maximum price ranges traders are willing to sell and buy the crypto coin respectively. Moving averages: This is by far the most commonly used technical analyses tool and is available as both Simple moving averages (SMA) and Exponential moving averages (EMA). SMA involves summing up the price of a crypto coin over a specified period to determine its average price. EMA, on the other hand, involves averaging the price of the crypto coin over a given period while giving preference to more recent crypto performance data.

Step 4: Open a Cryptocurrency Trade

The best Bitcoin exchanges and brokerage houses offer crypto trading services. When starting out, however, we advise that you consider kicking off your crypto trading career on eToro.

This is a leading brokerage providing money market services like forex, shares and commodity and cryptocurrency trading.

It is headquartered in Israel but has leveraged technology in the past few years to expand operations into virtually every part of the world. This exponential growth would see it named one of the fastest-growing fintech companies in Europe.

So, why crypto trade on eToro platform?

Copy-trading eToro is an industry pioneer when it comes to embracing social trading, especially copy trading. The feature allows the beginner to continue learning about crypto trading while making elite-traders-like profits by copying the trades of leading traders at a small fee. Competitive leverages Due to the large volatilities experienced in the crypto trading industries, most crypto exchanges and brokerage houses won’t offer leveraged crypto trading services. With eToro however, you get to crypto-trade with leverages as high as 1:20. Transparency The last thing you need is an exchange or brokerage firm that keeps looking for ways of eating into your deposits and cryptocurrency trading profits through hidden fees.

How to Trade Crypto on eToro

eToro has for the longest time been a crypto CFD trading platform. This was until it penetrated the United States market in early May 2019 where CFD trading is illegal, forcing them to evolve and start processing crypto withdrawals and even come up with an eToro crypto wallet, for the U.S market. The trading process, however, remains largely unchanged:

1. Start by creating an eToro trading account



Creating a trading account with eToro is pretty straightforward. They will only need your names and address followed by identity verification where you send them your photo and that of your government-issued identification document.

They will also ask you a few questions to test your level of experience in crypto trading and assess the amounts of disposable incomes.[/toggle]

2. Deposit cash



If you wish to trade in any of the 15 crypto coins listed on the eToro platform, you will need to first activate your account by making a deposit.

Note that the minimum initial deposit amount acceptable here stands at $50 but you only need a minimum $25 to enter into a crypto trade. [/toggle]

3. Alternative 1: Buy or sell manually

Entering into a trade here is quite straightforward. On your user dashboard, click on the Trade Markets Icon under discover.

This opens a crypto trading window with a list of crypto coins. Getting into a trade at this point is all about clicking on your preferred cryptocurrency and making a sale or buy decision.[/toggle]

4. Alternative 2: Copy trading



If you aren’t too confident about your crypto trading skills, don’t have time to carefully analyze trades or are just a beginner but still want to profit from winning trades, consider copy trading.

eToro makes it possible for you to copy the trades – the price entry and exit points – of some of the most experienced and profitable traders on its platform.

Under the discover section of your dashboard, select copy trades and this presents you with a list of all pro-traders that you can copy trades from.

Alternative 3: Trade a cryptocurrency copy portfolio

Still, under the discover section on your eToro’s user dashboard is the ‘trade-in copy portfolios’ option.

Here, the broker has pieced together different trade portfolios that comprise of highly diversified assets. These are expertly managed and the broker is also constantly monitoring their performance.

If you don’t feel like trading cryptos manually or copying other people’s trades, you may consider trading in one of the crypto coin portfolios listed therein.[/toggle]

Disclaimer: Transacting in virtual currencies is subject to various risks, such as price volatility, and is therefore not suitable for everyone. Your capital is at risk. eToro offers only Crypto (real crypto no CFD) so only buy with no leverage, later on this year eToro will also offer real stocks for trading.

The choice of the best crypto trading approach here should be informed by such factors as your cryptocurrency trading experience and the amount of time you have at hand for the analysis of these trades.

Understanding the types of trades available for crypto-traders

There are two primary ways of trading Crypto. You can choose to trade in the crypto exchanges where you get to own the coins or through a CFD Broker where you trade cryptocurrency CFDs.

Both trading methods are equally profitable but adopt varied approaches to crypto trading.

For instance, if you hope to own the coins you are buying, you must also get ready to protect them. And this involves investing in different wallets for the individual coins.

Trading cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is relatively straightforward and does not involve the transfer of ownership of the traded coins.

You are only entering into a contractual agreement with your broker and betting against the price action. You, therefore, don’t need wallets and are exposed to such niceties of crypto trading like leverage that allow you to stake more than your trading account balance.

More importantly, you are exposed to innovative trading technologies that allow you to benefit from such innovative technologies as copy trading.

What are the pros and cons of cryptocurrency trading?

Factors affecting the crypto trades and the crypto market

After understanding the type of trades available, you will now want to gather as much information about the cryptocurrency market as possible.

This starts with identifying the different factors acting on blockchain technology and the cryptocurrencies and understanding how each affects the price, demand, and supply of different coins.

Master the art of leveraging volatility:

Cryptocurrency trading is by far the most volatile form of trade. But for the most part, this volatility has almost always been presented in a negative light.

For instance, when Bitcoin depreciated in value from $3,000 to $2,000 and climbed up to $5,000 within three months in 2017, some bitcoin trading enthusiasts were quick to point out how quickly it is to lose money.

And while it is important to take this observation into consideration, you also need to bring objectivity. You need to learn how to master this volatility to your advantage by riding even the most volatile markets to profitability.

A case in point here would be waiting to buy when bitcoin price hits the trough and then riding it until it peaks and stagnates.

Understand how blockchain works

Safe for bitcoin that was developed as an alternative to Fiat currency, most other digital currencies including the all-popular-Ethereum are tokens, specially designed to be within a specific blockchain.

In this case, anything that affects the blockchain will ultimately have an impact on the tokens.

For instance, banks and technology-based companies are constantly embracing the security and integrity features of the different blockchain protocols in their day to day operations.

This is always a plus to the network whose net impact is an increased token price. Bugs and hacks, like the ones rocking Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, tend to push the crypto-coin price downwards.

Internal forces and how they affect trades

If you are to go pro with crypto trading you must also commit to mastering all the different internal factors affecting the price of one or all crypto coins.

For instance, is a particular crypto exchange site believed to inflate trading volumes?

Have hackers discovered another exploitable bug with a crypto coin? Has another coin reached its minable limit?

These are all internal crypto industry factors that affect the demand and supply of a coin as well as its price by extension.

External factors and their influence on crypto prices

There are a host of factors that have a direct impact on the demand and supply of the crypto coins and the crypto trade but tend to emanate from outside the industry.

These include threats of crypto trade regulation by different governments, actual ban of cryptocurrencies and crypto trade – like in the case of China, negative media reports about crypto hacks that create negative sentiments towards the trade, a coin’s adoption by multinational industry influencers brand or even hiked electricity prices that affect crypto mining.

Learning about these and more external factors and their impact on crypto price and trade goes a long way in helping learn how to analyze trades and forecast the price action actions. [/su_list]

What do you need to know before taking up a trading position?

Stop loss and take profit and limit orders

You now are all set, but before you start buying and selling crypto, you must first learn basic risk management practices and how they protect your capital.

And the most basic involves learning how to use the stop loss and target profit orders. Stop-loss is a market order that pulls you out of a losing trade while target profit is the point at which you would like to get out of a winning trade before it tips.

You must also learn to use limit orders – the maximum price at which you are willing to buy a crypto coin.

Position size, risk amounts and risk/reward ratio

You will also want to establish a base for your cryptocurrency trading strategy. This is informed by the position size – the number of units of an altcoin that you are willing to trade, such as 5BTC or 15 XRP, the risk amount – the amount of money that you stand to lose should your forecasts fail, and risk-reward that signifies the potential mounts you stand to gain should your forecasts come through.

These should then help you come up with an ideal risk-to-reward ratio that you should strive to adhere to for all your trades.

Leveraged crypto trading

Leveraged crypto trades ensure that you score above average profits when you have your analysis and price predictions for a particular digital coin right.

But they will also result in above-average losses if you are wrong. It on this basis that we advise you to practice moderation when it comes to leveraged crypto trading.

Learn how to secure your funds

If your trading strategy and choice of trading platform involve owning the traded crypto, you must embrace the most upbeat methods of keeping them safe.

We understand that in the spirit of profit maximization, you may be tempted to leave these coins with the crypto exchange if they promise to invest them safely on your behalf and pay attractive interests.

But in light of the numerous vulnerabilities, most of these exchanges are exposed to hacks – case in point being the MTGox and Bitfinex hacks- we advise that you consider withdrawing your coins and saving the keys in a hardware wallet.

This is a physical device that keeps the private keys used to access your crypto coin assets safe. And some of the most popular hardware wallets include: Ledger Nano S Wallet, TREZOR wallet, KeepKey wallet[/su_list]

Glossary of Cryptocurrency Terms Bottom line You will make it a crypto trader if you are willing to dedicate more time to mastering the basics of the trade. Note that most people never make it past the first few trades because they approach crypto trade not like any other form of trade but as a quick cash program. They never take enough time to decide on the type of trader they want to become or in learning as much as they can about factors affecting the crypto industry or the different altcoins. Even more distressing is the fact that they never take time to master and decide on the best trading strategy. Rather, they are too quick to embrace any strategy and exchange that promises instant returns. With this guide however you get to enjoy the benefits of both worlds where brokers allow you to make to copy trade while mastering the trade on the side.

FAQs

What is a cryptocurrency? This refers to a digital currency that was specially designed to serve as a medium of exchange within a blockchain network. Their influence has since spewed over to the world and most conventional brands and institutions are gradually recognizing these digital coins as an accepted medium of exchange.

Is crypto trading a good way to make money? Yes, the volatility experienced in the cryptocurrency industry has transformed crypto coin trading into one of the most profitable money market trades. These have however been a source of pain and unimaginable capital loss for traders that staked high on poorly analyzed trades.

What are the most traded coins? The last thing you need when it comes to crypto trading is sticking with a little-known and low-volume traded coin that no one wants to buy. We advise that you first invest in the high volume and high demand coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic. You can also consult different cryptocurrency trading charts to single out digital currencies with the highest transaction volumes.

Between shares and cryptocurrency trading, which is more profitable? Crypto trades are by far more profitable than investing in shares and stocks. This can be attributed to the surge in popularity for crypto coins and less bureaucracy in investments due to a lack of regulatory policies.",,https://coinweek.com/bullion-report/bitcoin-vs-gold-10-crystal-clear-comparisons/,"By Everett Millman – Gainesville Coins ……



Bitcoin vs. Gold: What’s the Difference?

The financial media has at times struggled to cover the emerging sector of cryptocurrencies. By now many have at least heard of the first and most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

If you ask a crypto enthusiast why Bitcoin is different from the thousands of other altcoins and digital tokens out there, you’ll often hear Bitcoin referred to by the nickname “digital gold” or even “gold 2.0”.

There are quite a few reasons why this label has stuck, aside from being catchy marketing:

Both have obvious monetary characteristics, by virtue of gold’s history and Bitcoin’s original vision (and its name).

Both are often categorized as “alternative investments” by Wall Street.

Both have a limited supply that gradually increases over time as a result of “mining”.

At some point in the future, the supply growth of each will slow down, ultimately to a fixed amount.

Just like gold is the king of precious metals, Bitcoin is the most trusted and most valuable of the cryptocurrencies.

Despite these surface-level similarities, the assertion that Bitcoin is truly a digital form of gold is worth further examination. Is it fair to compare the two favorably after analyzing the similarities and differences, and scrutinizing the relevant pros and cons, of Bitcoin vs. gold?

With decades of experience buying and selling in the precious metals industry, we have a wealth of knowledge in this area to share.

We also have spent years participating in, researching, and advocating for the cryptocurrency trade (my desk at the office is literally surrounded by crypto mining hardware on either side).

Our expertise in both areas allows us to provide some unique insights into the gold vs. Bitcoin comparison.

We’ve identified a set of 10 straightforward attributes relevant for comparing Bitcoin and gold. Which of the two is better at what it purportedly does? We’ll evaluate which side is better-suited along each of these 10 dimensions.

1. Gold Has More Durable Sources of Value

One thing that gold has undeniably been associated with throughout history is value. Gold’s centuries of use as money, in international commerce and later as backing for money, plainly attests to this.

Bitcoin also makes a clear claim to a similar type of universal value. Aside from being a proof-of-concept for decentralized, fully digital currency, Bitcoin has the word “coin” right there in the name!

How does Bitcoin’s value measure up? We have to look at more than just price. Pointing out that BTC is trading at $4,000 USD while the gold spot price is at $1,300 USD per ounce is not an apples-to-apples evaluation.

Sometimes you’ll see enthusiastic Bitcoiners cite the current prices, but equating one troy ounce of gold to one Bitcoin is rather arbitrary.

You can more reasonably compare the market capitalization (in dollar terms) of the Bitcoin supply against the total value of all the world’s gold. By this metric, the roughly $8 trillion of gold in the world dwarfs Bitcoin’s market cap of approximately $100 billion.

If we break it down further, it might be appropriate to liken the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, a Satoshi (1/100,000,000th of a BTC–meaning it takes a hundred million Satoshi to equal one BTC), to an incredibly small weight of gold, such as a milligram. A single mg is the same as 1/1,000,000 (i.e. a millionth) of a kilogram. Expressed in these terms, the value of 100 Satoshi is roughly the same as 10 milligrams of pure gold: Each is worth about 40¢.

Ultimately, the value of Bitcoin is based entirely on potential and perception. To be fair, the latter is also largely true of all fiat currencies.

By contrast, gold has intrinsic value. Gold is classified as a “noble” or precious metal. Its unique properties as an element make gold useful in a surprising array of industries, from the tech and medical fields to aeronautics. Moreover, because of its beautiful luster and unsurpassed malleability, gold continues to have underlying value as a popular medium for jewelry and religious artwork.

The point is that gold isn’t only valuable due to its monetary characteristics or investment potential. Gold has a variety of important real-world uses that make it worth the cost of digging out of the ground.

Winner: Heretofore (and for the foreseeable future), gold.

2. Bitcoin and Gold Both Have Many Types of Demand

Bitcoin has three primary areas of demand, or use cases:

Digital currency Speculative asset The blockchain network itself

First and foremost, Bitcoin is most readily identified as a peer-to-peer, decentralized digital currency. This is undoubtedly what most of its early adopters, and the general public, see as the main purpose of cryptocurrencies.

More recently, we have also seen an explosion of interest in Bitcoin as a speculative asset. As such, BTC prices—and the health of the broader crypto space as a whole—have experienced bouts of incredibly high volatility.

A mere 0.3% of Bitcoin transactions are in the form of payments. It’s estimated that currently, as much as 80% of BTC trading volume is purely for speculation.

There is also growing demand for the blockchain technology that underpins the Bitcoin network. This is essentially a distributed digital ledger (i.e., a fancy database) that records all transactions that occur on the network.

Neither blockchain nor cryptography more generally is exclusive to Bitcoin. Virtually all other digital currencies (often grouped together as “altcoins”) make use of these tools. Although the notion of building innovative features on top of a blockchain, such as autonomously-executing smart contracts, is more closely associated with another major cryptocurrency network called Ethereum, it’s true that any type of file can potentially be stored on the blockchain.

There are, however, lingering problems with the Bitcoin model of mining. “Mining” in this context is the method of generating new Bitcoins while also verifying transactions on the blockchain. The process relies on a Proof of Work concept that rewards miners for contributing their computing power to the network.

Bitcoin’s model is unavoidably deflationary: Put differently, each BTC should theoretically increase in purchasing power over time because the supply of new Bitcoins will always be shrinking until it reaches its predetermined maximum of 21 million.

Although this sounds reasonable on its face, it also has the consequence of making mining unprofitable at some point in the future. Eventually, the reward of Bitcoin given to miners could be worth less than the cost of the electricity to mine them in the first place.

This issue can supposedly be solved by adjusting the “difficulty” of the mining algorithms, but it remains to be seen how Bitcoin will be used and how Bitcoin trading will operate as we approach the 21 million limit next decade.

Another problem is that Bitcoin has “forked” before. A fork usually means a faction of users disagree with some aspect of the network model, so they decide to break off and start a separate blockchain. This increases the chance that the demand for Bitcoin could water down over time.

On the other hand, gold has abundant sources of demand. Its popularity for ornamentation, jewelry, and art is as robust as ever. Every day, it seems, new industrial uses for the yellow metal are discovered. Investment demand for gold coins and gold bars is also consistent.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s future is perhaps limitless. Given enough time and refinement, BTC could someday displace our current system of fiat currencies and centralized payment channels.

Winner: Tie; both arguably have a lot of future potential in this area.

3. Bitcoin Is Easier to Substitute

Another important consideration is how easily these assets can be substituted. If so, this dampens the long-term outlook.

Bitcoin has several prominent competitors in the crypto space. Ethereum (ETH) is noteworthy for the flexibility of its blockchain network, which can accommodate all sorts of apps and smart contracts. Ripple (XRP) is another major cryptocurrency, and its network can handle transactions much faster than Bitcoin.

All told, there are over 2,100 other altcoins in existence. This figure doesn’t even include the many cryptos that have failed or died thus far, as well. Bitcoin still accounts for roughly half of the total market capitalization of the entire crypto sector—56.3% at the time of writing. The market caps of Ethereum and Ripple are only about 10% and 7% of the sector, respectively, by comparison.

There is a much lower risk of gold being replaced or substituted for as the king of the precious metals.

This is apparent in the financial sector. Gold has been used as a store of wealth for centuries, and central banks around the world still hold tons of the metal. Frankly, it’s telling that we don’t see financial institutions holding any other commodities besides gold as reserves.

Aside from its history as physical money and the world’s monetary standard, gold is also crucial for many technologies. Gold has applications as a catalyst in chemical reactions, and its special properties prevent it from corroding under harsh conditions. This latter quality makes gold ideal for use in the aerospace industry and in medical settings, where the risk of failure can cost lives and billions of dollars.

In fact, an array of technologies rely on gold to work. Gold’s chemical and physical properties give it advantages over copper and silver for certain uses, such as in microprocessors, even though silver is actually better at conducting both heat and electricity.

Gold is nevertheless impossible to substitute in many of its technological and industrial applications.

Winner: Gold.

4. Bitcoin Has Much Higher Volatility

Volatility is a particularly important consideration here because “digital gold” would obviously have to have stability and staying power. In the simplest terms, volatility is a measure of how big and how frequent the swings are when an asset’s price is moving or changing.

By any measure, Bitcoin volatility has been incredibly high over the years. Large vacillations in price are essentially the norm.

This pattern held true even after the Bitcoin market reached full exuberance. BTC rose an astounding 1,800% over the course of 2017, yet it subsequently crashed the following year. Prices plunged nearly 80% from their peak.

This is not to imply that gold has zero volatility. Gold prices more than doubled (+100%) during the two years immediately following the global financial crisis in 2009 before giving back more than a third of those gains in the following economic cycle.

In the long run, gold has maintained its purchasing power against other currencies. Gold’s millennia-long track record in this regard speaks for itself.

The ups and downs for gold pale in comparison to the wild volatility that Bitcoin has exhibited over the last decade. Simply put, Bitcoin volatility is orders of magnitude higher than gold. This complicates Bitcoin’s case as a stable store of wealth and a trusted medium of exchange.

Winner: Gold, and it’s not especially close.

5. Bitcoin Is Easier to Liquidate

This point is related to liquidity, but not exactly the same. “Liquidation” in this context simply means selling.

The advent of electronic trading in financial markets has made liquidating a position in gold far easier than in the past. Only paper instruments such as gold ETFs or gold futures contracts enjoy this benefit, however.

There are indeed times when electronic gold trading closes. Obviously, this is also true of brick-and-mortar locations that sell physical gold, which cannot be liquidated with a few keystrokes. Gold does enjoy the benefits of a nearly universal market where you can surely sell your gold no matter what country you find yourself in.

Moreover, even during normal business hours, you will have to wait for your gold to be assayed–i.e., smelted and analyzed for purity and authenticity–if you are selling a generic bullion product.

Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, can take full advantage of electronic liquidation. Bitcoin and its copycats were designed specifically with digital transactions in mind. These cryptos inhabit the electronic world by their very nature.

Thus, selling your crypto for some other currency can be done from the convenience of a home computer or smartphone.

Winner: Somewhat of a push if paper gold is included, but the edge goes to Bitcoin for its electronic nature.

6. The Gold Market Has Superior Liquidity

It will be helpful to start with a definition of liquidity: essentially, how easily an asset can be bought or sold without impacting its market price.

This isn’t a trivial consideration. Bad liquidity means you might have to accept selling something for far less than it ought to be worth.

At intervals, Bitcoin has experienced rather poor liquidity. This is partly influenced by the lag in transaction speed during down times for the market; prices can jump or fall dramatically in the intervening hours. (Yes, sometimes the transactions take hours to execute.)

It’s also true that large-size trades tend to greatly impact the BTC price because trading volumes have been relatively thin under normal conditions. There have even been revelations that the vast majority—perhaps 95%!—of the reported volume is inflated by non-competitive trading patterns to give the appearance of greater liquidity.

Another problem is the wide discrepancy between prices on different Bitcoin exchanges. In a liquid market, there should be virtually no divergence between the price of the same asset trading on different platforms or venues.

The gold market stands in contrast due to its extremely high liquidity. Maybe the only more liquid market in the world is for United States Treasury bonds.

Daily trading volumes for gold are consistently high. Of course, you can also buy and sell physical gold all over the world—no matter how spotty your WiFi connection is. Perhaps most importantly for gold vs. Bitcoin considerations, gold has an abundant above-ground supply, and much of this precious metal eventually gets melted down and recycled rather than destroyed.

Winner: Gold.

7. Gold Offers Greater Usefulness as a Hedge

Many proponents of cryptocurrency assert that Bitcoin is an effective hedge against disruptions in the broader markets.

There is indeed a logical argument behind this assertion. Not only is Bitcoin widely seen as an “alternative” asset, but its creation was steeped in innovation and disruption from the beginning.

Bitcoin prices have nonetheless exhibited a strong correlation with stock prices over the last two years. This pattern of following the equity market significantly reduces the usefulness of Bitcoin as a hedge. In short, it defeats the purpose.

Hedging against market downturns, high inflation, and uncertainty are what gold does best. Gold is the ideal hedge during times of economic turmoil.

One of the biggest advantages that work in gold’s favor in this regard is that it is a non-correlated asset. This means that gold prices don’t tend to move in the same direction as other assets.

The only strong correlation gold exhibits is with currencies: The price of gold can rise or fall depending on the purchasing power of the currency it’s measured in. This dynamic is especially true with the U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency.

Because this relationship with fiat currencies is essentially an inverse (or negative) correlation, gold has tended to resist the effects of inflation (in terms of purchasing power) throughout history.

Winner: Gold, but BTC will perhaps close that gap over the next generation. It also helps that neither is better suited to some large-scale, material-intensive industry (e.g., copper).

8. Bitcoin Has More Value as an Appreciating Asset

Investors are, of course, always interested in their ROI—return on investment. Although an oversimplification, this is undoubtedly the most basic measure of an investment’s performance. Everyone wants to know (as they should): What amount of profit can I realize on my investment?

Gold prices have on the whole risen and kept pace with inflation throughout history. This property has held true for the precious metals over the long run, which is not true of fiat currencies.

Gold’s value as an investment is also underpinned by demand from a variety of industries, in addition to the economic realities of the gold mining sector.

By comparison, one must concede that (also on the whole) Bitcoin has appreciated in price dramatically in its first decade of life.

We’re not talking about a four-bagger or a ten-bagger. That alone would be a fantastic annual return. In Wall Street’s borrowed baseball lingo, Bitcoin was an almost unfathomable 19-bagger at one point in 2017: BTC rose by 1,800%, in other words.

The BTC price literally experienced exponential growth, in fact, prior to the massive price correction in late 2018. If you zoom out the time horizon just a few years, Bitcoin has appreciated some 5,000% from when it traded around $100 five years ago.

Bitcoin’s future potential for gains is undeniable. Yet it’s certainly not an investment for the faint of heart!

Remember that gold’s value appreciation over time has been for the most part steady. At no time have gold prices ever crashed 80%—over any time period; meanwhile, such extreme volatility has at times shaken the nascent Bitcoin community.

Ultimately, gold sees neither the spectacular gains nor spectacular losses that Bitcoin prices have been subject to.

Winner: Bitcoin, although speculatively so.

9. Bitcoin Carries Counterparty Risk

We touched on the notion of risk in the last section: For Bitcoin’s greater risk, it yields a greater financial reward.

Volatility is not the only risk that Bitcoin investors face, however. There is also the looming risk of having your Bitcoin wallet hacked, or one of the unregulated crypto exchanges freezing accounts.

But what is counterparty risk, exactly? This is the chance that the other party in a contract, trade, or transaction defaults on their obligation, creating a liability for the counterpart.

Counterparty risk plagues virtually all financial assets, but Bitcoin is an especially instructive case. BTC has seen more than its fair share of scams and risks in its brief lifetime as an asset. From the early days of Mt. Gox to the more recent fiasco with Quadriga, hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto has already been lost or stolen.

To be fair, this is a problem that’s inherent for all cryptos and digital assets, not just BTC. Nonetheless, counterparty risk has become a major issue. Coins have been stolen or hacked with alarming frequency, and most crypto exchanges are still beyond the scope of normal regulatory protections due to their decentralized framework.

Physical gold, meanwhile, has zero counterparty risk. It’s the only financial asset with this characteristic, in fact. If you own physical gold bullion, there is no chance of someone else defaulting.

Not only does this quality underpin gold’s case as a true hedge or safe haven, but the presence of counterparty obligations is the main knock against forms of “paper gold,” like gold ETFs or futures contracts. Each of these gold-linked vehicles for speculation relies on cash settlement rather than physical delivery of metals, exposing an investor to potential counterparty risks.

Winner: Gold.

10. Gold and Bitcoin Both Provide a Degree of Financial Safety

Safety is often overlooked when the makeup of an investment portfolio is under discussion. It’s unfortunate because many risks abound in investing. Everyone should plan accordingly for how much appetite for risk they can tolerate.

There are ways to mitigate some of these risks. The safest way to own gold is in physical form, and the safest storage method is in an authorized depository—an insured vault.

Vault storage is actually a requirement for precious metals included in Gold IRAs. In general, allocated storage is preferable to pooled storage, where metals are treated generically or interchangeably so everyone’s assets are mixed together. With allocated (or segregated) storage, the exact items you deposit are kept separated from other depositors’ assets.

It stands to reason that investing in gold is similar to saving money, except without the inflation or depreciation risk of fiat currencies. There is a similar argument to be made about Bitcoin’s inflationary advantages, though its track record is far shorter and this assertion grows less certain when one pulls the time horizon out farther than 15 to 20 years from now.

The equivalent to vault storage for Bitcoin is storing your BTC in a cold wallet. This means using offline storage, such as a USB drive or external hard drive, and keeping the key (or password) to your digital wallet well-protected. If you lose or forget the private key, nobody can access your Bitcoins.

So long as you protect the key to your digital wallet, the security of your Bitcoin account is very high.

Safely storing gold comes with the drawback of paying annual (or quarterly) storage fees. Unlike physical gold, however, any outage of electricity or the internet will effectively render your Bitcoin wallet inaccessible.

Winner: Tie; at least neither is the dollar or another fiat instrument.

Conclusion: Bitcoin Is Not Digital Gold Yet

Although we’ve taken a reasonably scientific approach to this question, and utilized expertise in both the precious metal and cryptocurrency spaces, there are of course other comparisons you could make for Bitcoin vs. gold. Depending on what you chose to compare, Bitcoin could look like the victor. We specifically focused, however, on qualities that would support or detract from Bitcoin’s case for the moniker digital gold.

If Bitcoin were actually “digital gold”, you would expect it to satisfy at least five to seven of these qualities. In fact, even when ties are counted, it only scores a 4/10.

Meanwhile, gold works better for 8/10 of the categories and makes a strong case as an alternative asset uniquely suited to the financial sector.

Over the longer-term (the next 10–15 years), it will be fascinating to see which path each of these broader asset classes (precious metals and cryptocurrencies) follow.

Banking giants in the U.S., Japan, and across Europe have created a consortium that will use cryptocurrency technology in cross-border transfers. The move also presents a direct competitor for Ripple’s XRP token.

Settlement ‘Crypto’ Coins for International Remittance

According to the Nikkei Asian Review, large banking corporations in Japan like MUFG and Sumitomo have led their counterparts in the U.S. and Europe to establish Fnality International.

Based in London, Fnality will create a cross-border settlement framework among participating banks that will utilize a fiat-pegged cryptocurrency.

The startup which has raised about $63 million in funding from these banking giants will create accounts in each of the banks before issuing utility settlement coins (USCs).

These USCs – fiat-pegged “cryptocurrencies” have a one-to-one ratio to the underlying fiat currencies. Thus, for a transfer originating in Japan and terminating in the U.S., the Japanese bank will deposit the transaction amount in yen to Japan’s central bank.

On the other end, Fnality issues the equivalent number of USCs to the receiving bank in the U.S. before being converted to U.S. dollars and sent to the recipient’s bank account.

According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), this system drastically reduces the cost of international payments by eliminating third-party intermediaries even though it seems Fnality sits “in the middle” of the transaction flow process.

Speaking to WSJ, Hyder Jaffrey, the investment strategy chief at UBS – one of the participating firms, said:

You remove settlement risk, the counterparty risk, the market risk. All of those risks add up to costs and inefficiencies in the marketplace.

UBS for its part has been exploring the possibility of creating USCs since 2015. Reports indicate that Fnality’s USC settlement platform will go begin operations sometime in 2020.

So Will Ripple and XRP Become Irrelevant?

Fnality’s USC concept is yet another addition to the class of potential Ripple/XRP competitors. The basic thesis of what the consortium is trying to achieve looks a lot like what Ripple has been trying to sell to banks the world over.

Banking institutions may be more amenable to the use of USCs than XRP in any of the current Ripple cross-border payment bundles. Though, crypto-purists would argue that permissioned and centralized infrastructure like Fnality and the USC are nonsense and aren’t cryptocurrencies at all.

USC also looks a lot like JPM coin, the “big announcement” from JPMorgan at the start of the year but with a broader focus than just internal settlements.

On the lighter side, Ultimate Secure Cash (USC) – the 1,680th-ranked cryptocurrency according to CoinMarketCap, may not be best pleased about the name clash.

In a Reddit post Sunday, a LocalBitcoins user pointed out the option was no longer available on the platform, though some comments suggested the restriction might be limited to the U.S..

The removal of the option – which acts as a matchmaker for users to make trades in person – effectively bars LocalBitcoin users from selling and buying bitcoin for cash. LocalBitcoins has also cancelled pending cash trades, other comments suggest.

The platform has not yet made an official announcement about the change on its blog or Twitter feed.

In response to the move, LocalEthereum announced has temporarily removed the trading fee on cash-in-person exchanges – effective June 1 to July 1.

LocalBitcoins’ move comes after the company announced in February that it would comply with the European Union’s (EU) new anti-money laundering directive.

Several other P2P cryptocurrency trading platforms still offer an in-person cash option.

Sun, founder of cryptocurrency Tron and CEO of file-sharing company BitTorrent, had the highest bid in the 20 years of the charity auction. Proceeds go to the Glide Foundation to help the homeless in San Francisco, where BitTorrent is located.

Winning the auction allows Sun to invite seven guests, and he said he's going to bring other cryptocurrency industry leaders to the lunch in New York. But he told CNBC he's not sure who he's going to be bring yet.

Sun said he's a believer and a fan of Buffett and his ""long-term value investing strategy."" He added that he wants to pay Buffett ""back for his inspiration.""

However, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO is not a fan of bitcoin. In the past, he's called it ""rat poison squared.""

When asked for comment on the lunch, Buffett laughed and told CNBC's Becky Quick that he was looking forward to it. The date for the lunch isn't set.

Sun admitted on ""Squawk Box"" he knows he won't change Buffett's mind in a three-hour lunch, but he hopes to offer him a different opinion and show him ""how much progress we've made"" in the past 10 years in the cryptocurrency industry. ""I want him to learn what the younger generations are doing,"" Sun added.

While some past winners have chosen to stay anonymous, Ted Weschler — later hired as a Berkshire investment manager — and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn were winners of the auction in previous years.

Cryptocurrency prices have corrected over the last 24 hours as most digital assets have dropped in value between 6-10% since June 2 at around 6:45 p.m. EST. At press time the entire cryptoconomy is valued at $250 billion with about $80.5 billion in global trades in the last day.

Bulls Get Pushback

Digital currency values are lower this week after many coins dropped a few percentages during Sunday evening’s trading sessions. Crypto bulls started showing some exhaustion during our last markets update but global trade volume has remained roughly the same. On June 4 at press time, the price per bitcoin core (BTC) is around $8,011 and BTC has a market capitalization of about $142 billion. BTC is down 6% today and has lost 7.9% over the last seven days.

The second largest market valuation is ethereum (ETH) and each coin is trading for $250. ETH has a total market cap of around $26.6 billion and has lost about 4.7% over the last 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) is trading for $0.41 per XRP, having dropped 5.9% in the last day. Lastly, the fifth largest market valuation is held by litecoin (LTC) and each LTC is swapping for $105 per coin. LTC charts show a loss of 5.8% for the day and 7.4% for the entire week.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) prices have dipped as well and each coin is trading for $397 per BCH at press time. BCH has lost 7.4% for the day and over the last seven days prices have dropped by 8.2%. Currently, bitcoin cash has an overall market cap of about $7 billion and over $2.1 billion in global trades in the last 24 hours. The top exchanges swapping the most BCH today include Coinbene, P2pb2b, Hitbtc, Binance, Huobi Pro, and Digifinex.

42.7% of today’s BCH trades are paired against tether (USDT) which is followed by BTC, capturing 26.1% of trades. Other strong BCH pairs on June 4 include USD (16.5%), KRW (7.8%), EUR (2.4%), JPY (1.9%), and TUSD (0.73%). Since April 1 BCH has seen a significant increase in daily onchain transactions with 35,000-150,000 transactions per day and on June 4 there’s been around 51,000 so far.

BCH/USD Technical Indicators

Looking at the 4-hour BCH/USD chart on Kraken shows that bulls have lost the reins temporarily. Technical indicators show that most oscillators are either impartial signals or sell signals. For instance, the MACd, a momentum oscillator that subtracts the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, shows bears may pull the price down a bit lower. However, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI ~32.93) is hovering in the middle after touching overbought conditions on June 3.

The two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) reveal the 100 SMA is still above the longer term 200 SMA trendline. This indicates that the path toward the least resistance is still the upside despite the recent correction. Order books show some fresh resistance above the $400 mark and some walls within the $430-450 range as well. On the backside, if bears attempt to bring the price lower than they will be stopped at support foundations between $375-340.

Crypto Assets, Precious Metals and the Tumultuous World Economy

It seems that crypto prices are consolidating at the moment and intraday traders are searching for new positions. The downturn also follows alongside U.S. stocks tumbling in value with Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) losing 365 points on June 3 and Nasdaq and S&P followed suit. Precious metals saw small increases yesterday and the price of gold is nearing a 13-month high. Some believe that precious metals like gold and silver and cryptocurrencies will be fueled by economic uncertainty as both types of markets have seen significant jumps in value.

It’s likely due to the U.S. dollar’s drop in value which was sparked by commentary stemming from the St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard and Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Spectators believe the U.S. central bank is contemplating an interest rate cut in order to stabilize the American economy and dollar. As it stands, digital asset market values have increased a great deal in 2019. Even with the dip in value over the last 48 hours, at current market prices, cryptocurrency investments have still outpaced stocks, gold, and crude oil by a long shot.

Four contestants are currently racing their way around the globe in a quest to reach Amsterdam first. The Payments Race runs westwards from London, circling the globe before finishing at the Money 2020 event in the Dutch capital today, June 4. In keeping with its theme, each contestant must use a different payment method throughout their journey. Alex Hobern has selected cryptocurrency as his sole means of sustenance and survival on the winner-takes-all journey.

Round the World Payments Race Showcases the Future of Money

Cash, card, mobile and crypto are the four payment methods available for the Round the World Payments Race, with one assigned to each racer. Northern Ireland, Hong Kong and Lithuania are among the checkpoints to be visited during the course of the westward circumnavigation.

Crypto candidate Alex Hobern is accustomed to drumming up publicity in his role as a social media creator and TV personality, but he’s a confessed newb when it comes to cryptocurrency. As such, his journey is one of self-discovery as much as it is global conquest. The rules of the challenge mandate that he can’t use crypto surrogates such as cryptocurrency debit cards or BATMs: Hobern is only permitted to spend crypto in its purest P2P form.

The Challenges of Living on Cryptocurrency

When asked by news.Bitcoin.com why he had selected cryptocurrency from the available options, Hobern explained: “In my view, it poses the biggest challenge. With a large and dedicated community, its adoption by merchants is extremely low. Being someone who thrives out of their comfort zone, I decided it was the best way to make the trip an actual challenge.” He confesses to having known “absolutely nothing” about cryptocurrency prior to the race save for a few tales from mates who got rich during the market mania of 2017. To help him out, London-based cryptocurrency payment service Wirex gave him a crash course on everything he should know before setting out.

Cryptocurrency’s suitability for spending is a matter that’s fiercely divided its community. While a significant proportion of BTC users have no desire to spend their coins, which they believe to be a store of value, others are eager to deploy their crypto as P2P cash including BCH, LTC, and DASH owners. Alex Hobern speaks glowingly of the support he’s received from the crypto community on his journey, but admits to having experienced difficulty in finding businesses that would accept cryptocurrency. He even visited a place called the Crypto Cafe that wouldn’t accept his digital coins.

Prior to arriving in Europe, Alex’s team were firmly in the lead, based on points scored for completing various payment challenges along the way. However, he found it difficult to complete the ‘Different modes of transport’ challenge in Europe using crypto, where he instead resorted to ticking off as many countries as possible to gain additional points.

Crypto’s Value Is Universally Recognized

Despite the difficulties of spending cryptocurrency in certain places, in every country Hobern has visited, there were people willing to welcome him and his crypto with open arms. Trip highlights have included yachting in San Francisco bay, with the aid of Cheung Tan from Token, who purchased tickets, enabling Hobern to pay him in BTC. Future.Travel and Trippki were used to arrange flights and hotels, all paid for in crypto, leaving Hobern with the task of meeting crypto enthusiasts on the ground to help him get around.

Hell yeah… what a wild ride it was. Round the world in 2 weeks using crypto 🔥🔥 #TeamCrypto #PaymentsRace pic.twitter.com/IksuLYa0xI — Alex Hobern (@alexhobern) June 4, 2019

During the course of his trip, which finishes today, Hobern has managed to spend cryptocurrency in the U.K., Ireland, Canada, U.S., Hong Kong, Dubai, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Finland, Belgium and Amsterdam, primarily in BTC, ETH, and LTC. The difficulties of using bitcoin core for small payments became evident on at least one occasion, when Hobern found that the cost of the transaction fee exceeded the cost of the goods.

Team Crypto was first to cross the finish line a few hours ago, but will need to wait to find out whether they accrued more points than the other teams. Win or lose the Round the World Payments Race, Alex Hobern claims to have developed a love for all things crypto, and a desire to get into investing and trading when his epic journey wraps up in Amsterdam later today.

Bitcoin will conquer Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and everything else. That's the wildly bullish forecast of ex-Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan. | Source: TechCrunch/Flickr (i), Shutterstock (ii). Image Edited by CCN.com.

By CCN.com: Bitcoin will completely disrupt the entire tech industry, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street. That’s the wildly-optimistic outlook of a former executive at crypto unicorn Coinbase.

Crypto Will Disrupt EVERYTHING

Despite making a surprise exit from the cryptocurrency exchange last month, Balaji Srinivasan says he remains a firm believer in bitcoin’s future. Srinivasan served as Coinbase’s chief technology officer (CTO) for close to a year before announcing his departure in May.

One month later, Srinivasan unleashed a tweetstorm concretizing his reputation as the most rabid of bitcoin bulls. More than just predicting that cryptocurrency could become a store of value, he opined that public blockchains would disrupt virtually every sector of the global economy.

To his point, blockchain has already witnessed steady adoption in the financial industry, with Vanguard recently announcing $1.3 trillion in index funds managed through distributed ledgers. Srinivasan envisions a future in which the global economy runs on the blockchain. A public blockchain.

Wall Street’s in a Mess of Trouble

The bullish prediction is not far off from what other industry enthusiasts have predicted for the potential of crypto and blockchain. While many analysts have called for a reshaping of securities that would see stocks issued through tokens–similar to initial coin offerings–Srinivasan goes a step further.

With the rise of crypto, Srinivasan finds Silicon Valley and Wall Street redundant. Rather than going through traditional channels for funding, raising capital and operating a business, crypto allows entrepreneurs to function with nothing more than an internet connection.

While Srinivasan’s argument centers on crypto disrupting the existing tech industry, his faith in digital currencies speaks to their ability to inspire globalization. As he points out, location becomes irrelevant when citizens can transact with bitcoin. Crypto provides an alternative to the restrictions of government fiat–a powerful tool in places like Venezuela and Argentina where hyperinflation is the norm.

Decentralization, the idea that crypto can operate without a figure of authority, will also lead to upheaval in the tech sector. Silicon Valley’s venture capitalist industry started as a way for lean startups to circumvent traditional funding routes. Crypto will take that process to a new level.

Bitcoin Will Be the New Gold Standard

Srinivasan sees bitcoin becoming a “universally valued instrument,” driven through mass adoption by major corporations. Despite precious metal pundits disparaging bitcoin as worthless, Srinivasan anticipates bitcoin quickly cementing its status as the “digital gold standard.”

Bitcoin is more versatile than gold and capable of operating on a digital landscape. It also has the support of millennials, with 90 percent of younger investors preferring bitcoin to gold, according to one investing expert.

On Monday, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered Bank Leumi to allow the exchange ongoing access its services, according to a report by Finance Magnates. Bank Leumi had earlier moved to bar Bits of Gold after the bank classified cryptocurrency firms as gambling companies.

The Supreme Court had made a temporary injunction on the matter back in February, allowing the firm to keep using Bank Leumi’s services until a final decision was made. The ruling now means the exchange can continue using its account with the Israeli bank on a permanent basis.

The court victory was welcomed by Bits of Gold CEO Yuval Roash, who described the decision as an “exciting moment” for the company.

“We worked hard to set up a company, which met regulatory requirements, in a new industry, and those efforts paid off. I am proud to be a part of this flourishing industry and push it towards the right regulation,” Roash said.

While the bank has apparently objected to the ruling, the court’s decision look likely to pave the way for cryptocurrency exchanges in Israel to continue using local banking services.

According to a filing reported by The Next Web, the official operating entity, Blockport BV, was declared bankrupt in a court in Amsterdam on May 21. The platform ceased services at the end of May, as announced in a blog post (although the website is still online as of writing).

In the post, co-founder and chief product officer Sebastiaan Lichter said that following the exchange’s failed security token offering – which had a €1 million ($1.12 million) soft cap – “we have decided to drastically scale down our operations and development.”

Lichter wrote:

“Running our operations and platform as-is without a substantial investment is currently not an economically viable and responsible option.”

As the exchange currently cannot generate sufficient revenues, he said the focus is now on “expanding the platform with unique and value-adding technological features, that strengthen our business case for a potential future restart.”

While the operating entity is now bankrupt, Lichter said this would not affect its efforts to prepare for a “restart” of the platform.

He continued:

“We still see a lot of opportunities in this industry and have built a top performing trading platform that many people love to use and which has had almost zero downtime or issues since we launched it in the summer of 2018.”

Customers were given prior warning to withdraw any remaining funds, and according to the post, can still withdraw by emailing support.

If you are keeping funds on a cryptocurrency platform such as a centralized exchange it is highly advisable you make sure your accounts are as safe as possible. Using a physical security key can greatly help with this as well as safeguarding other private services such as email and cloud storage.

Secure Your Crypto Accounts With a Physical Key

A physical security key is a piece of hardware used for verifying you have permission to access sensitive online services. It can be used for securing accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges employing two-factor authentication, replacing more vulnerable methods such as receiving verification codes via SMS. It greatly reduces the risk of hackers remotely taking over your account with cyber attacks such as phone porting, as they now need to have the actual device in their hands to gain access to your account.

One such physical security tool for crypto exchange accounts is Yubikey, which supports platforms such as Bitbay, Bitfinex, Bitmex and Kraken, among hundreds of other services. It is a line of small USB devices that fit into your computer and verify authentication with the press of a button. Many more platforms can be used with these tools and Coinbase exchange recently announced it is also gradually rolling out support for universal second factor security keys to its users, calling them “the gold standard of modern account security.”

The cryptocurrency's meteoric bounce this year could be a sign that it's becoming somewhat of a safe haven amid increasing volatility in the stock market, Bleakley Advisory Group's Peter Boockvar said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" It was trading at more than $8,700 earlier this week and was above $7,800 on Wednesday morning.

""I watch bitcoin as a signal, as an indicator, not because I want to own it,"" said Boockvar, a noted crypto bear. ""Over the last couple weeks, we've seen this sharp rise in bitcoin, and to me, that was saying something in terms of what markets were thinking about what the Fed was going to do [and about] the turmoil created by the threatened tariffs.""

With the market now anticipating the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice before the end of 2019, and the Trump administration escalating its multifront trade war, traditional ""safe havens"" like gold — Boockvar's preferred safety play — and the U.S. dollar are also gaining momentum.

Boockvar, Bleakley's chief investment officer, pointed out that bitcoin began to rally before gold did, an intriguing move that might speak to the digital currency's status as a real, if not-yet-proven, alternative to stocks.

""I still think it's in its infancy, and I only bring it up here because we saw a short move over the past month that I was thinking, well something is causing this,"" he said. ""I don't recommend bitcoin in either direction because I don't really care for it in terms of an asset, but I do care for it as a signaling mechanism that I think was a tipoff to this bounce in gold.""

""From here on, can bitcoin be a safe haven as much as gold? I don't know yet,"" he said. ""But, again, I'd still rather own gold either way.""

Gold — which held near a three-month peak Tuesday — harbors some intrigue of its own, Boockvar said. He noted that its recent rally occurred at the same time as a rise in the U.S. dollar index, a move that he called ""most noteworthy"" given their typically inverse correlation.

""Really, the sole bear case on gold is a stronger dollar, and if they both rally together, well, then there's no bear case anymore,"" he said. ""And if the dollar actually falls, well, then gold can really get its legs.""

That could play out if Tuesday's rapid rally is what Boockvar believes it is: a ""dead-cat bounce,"" a term used on Wall Street to refer to a short-lived rally in the stock market after a meaningful decline.

""For now, this is just a dead-cat bounce back to around the 2,800 level until you get clarity on China. I don't think Mexico goes anywhere.

Over the last few months, the geocaching treasure hunt Findbitcoin.cash has gathered a bunch of new hidden BCH treasures. At the time of publication, there are approximately 105 concealed bitcoin cash wallets hidden all over the world with a large portion of these funds hidden in the U.S. and Australia.

Hide Treasures or Become a BCH Scavenger With Findbitcoin.cash

Bitcoin cash supporters have seen a ton of innovative projects over the last few months and some of them have given people a new and fun experience to play around with. One initiative called Findbitcoin.cash gives people a sense of adventure because it allows them to both hide and search for BCH wallets anywhere in the world. Geocaching treasure hunt games have been extremely popular over the last few years and the creators of Findbitcoin.cash have brought the trend to the BCH ecosystem.

The platform gives people basic directions on how to print a bitcoin cash-loaded paper wallet and hide it in an obscure location. The website provides its own paper wallet generator, which creates a random public and private key pair for the creator. If a person decides to hide a bitcoin cash wallet using the platform they will need the public key in order to add it to the Findbitcoin.cash listings along with a hint about where the treasure can be found.

The BCH geocaching service recommends that people hiding BCH loot should print two copies of each wallet they are going to hide. This way if anything happens to the wallet, from say the weather or an animal, they can sweep the wallet later after they are satisfied it was compromised by the elements or too long has elapsed and the wallet was never found. Findbitcoin.cash also recommends that people use a plastic ziplock bag to protect the paper wallet from the weather or the hider could laminate it too. After creating the paper wallet, you can create a listing that gives people a description of the area where you hid the funds and you can add a few pictures as well of the surrounding location.

For instance, there’s this BCH hidden treasure taped to the Amway sign in front of the Amway World Headquarters. The specific post from Michigan offers a geolocation on the map and a picture of the Amway building. There’s also a comment section on each post too and the Findbitcoin.cash team says they “will be monitoring the addresses that are posted, so we can ensure that there are no points on the map with which there are no longer any wallets.”

Then there’s another posting called the “one of a kind Toronto Raptors wallet” which contains 0.2231669 BCH or $88 at the time of writing. Members of the BCH community have helped top the wallet up and the funds have been hidden somewhere in Toronto. “It won’t be easy to find,” explains the person who hid the BCH. “In order to learn where the wallet is, the Toronto Raptors need to win their games — Each game won, we will release a bigger clue — Each game lost, we will release a really small clue and clues will be added to this page.” So far there’s been one clue released so far on June 3 which states that the wallet is “within 1,000 foot radius of the house on the hill.” The Findbitcoin.cash platform’s paper wallets also have a message printed on them which explains what Bitcoin Cash is and how the finder or treasure hunter can learn more about the innovative technology.

“Congratulations — You have found a bitcoin cash paper wallet,” the paper wallets message reads. “Yes, this paper is worth real money. Bitcoin cash is a form of digital currency. It allows you to send or receive any amount of money to or from anyone in the world, anytime you want, virtually for free.”

Bitcoin Cash Has Been Hidden in 18 Countries and 6 Continents

The paper wallet then instructs the person who happens to find the money to head to the Findbitcoin.cash website, where it will teach them about bitcoin cash and how to claim the funds. Right now there’s been a total of 294 wallets hidden throughout nearly every continent in the world and 189 have been found so far. Out of the 18 countries that have seen people concealing wallets for the Findbitcoin.cash treasure hunts, the U.S. and Australia have been the most dominant areas. Out of the 105 unclaimed to date, there is a bunch of BCH treasures hidden in Thailand, India, Venezuela, Milan, Japan, and the Netherlands. Findbitcoin.cash also has a dedicated Twitter handle and Reddit forum called r/findbitcoincash so people can post about their hidden treasures and follow updates.

The BCH community has always been about fervently pushing BCH adoption and accessibility throughout the world. The BCH-based geocaching treasure hunt gives people a chance to not only learn about the benefits of the Bitcoin Cash network, but it also provides a recreational activity for those who dig the challenge of treasure hunts. With Findbitcoin.cash, people can savor both aspects of the hunt, relishing the ability to hide funds and clues but also allowing anyone from any location to scavenge for these digital treasures.

The 88-year-old investing guru is flat-out against the cryptocurrency, having called it “a scam,” “a mirage” and “rat poison squared,” among other things. But without a choice, the Berkshire Hathaway chief is about to have lunch with not one, but eight, young cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.

Last weekend, the annual “Warren Buffett Power Lunch” was sold for a record $4.6 million in an eBay auction. It was just revealed that the winner of the charity lunch was a 28-year-old Chinese blockchain entrepreneur named Justin Sun, who is the founder of cryptocurrency Tron and San Francisco-based file-sharing company BitTorrent.

Per the guest rule of the “Power Lunch,” Sun is allowed to bring up to seven friends to join the meal with Buffett in New York. He said he would extend this opportunity to other cryptocurrency industry leaders. So far, he’s invited the founders of Ethereum and LiteCoin, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (who has declined to attend).

According to his LinkedIn profile, Sun jump-started his entrepreneur career with the success of a Chinese voice live-streaming startup called Callme (Peiwo) and forayed into the crypto world by serving as the chief China representative for Ripple Labs from 2013 to 2016. He is also a protégé of Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

In his announcement of the winning bid this week, Sun said he’s a big fan of Buffett and his “long-term value investing strategy,” and he would try to convince Buffett that Bitcoin—as well as other emerging blockchain ventures—are a perfect fit for his investment criteria.

“The long-term value investment strategy and cryptocurrency, in my eyes, are one and the same,” Sun wrote in an open letter to the cryptocurrency community. “We in the community know we have a long road ahead of us to educate the mainstream on blockchain’s value and proper use cases.”

That said, Sun admits that he probably he won’t change Buffett’s stance on cryptocurrencies in a three-hour lunch, he told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, but he wants to show him “how much progress we’ve made” and “want him to learn what the younger generations are doing.”

In a statement to the press, Warren said he looks forward to the lunch. “I’m delighted with the fact that Justin has won the lunch and am looking forward to meeting him and his friends. We are going to have a good time, and Glide will use his contribution to help many thousands of people.”

All proceeds from the charity auction will go to the Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco to help the homeless and impoverished in the area.",2019-06-05 16:17:34+00:00,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-expensive-india-modi-government/,"

Bitcoin trading and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to be shunned in India under the re-elected government. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: The re-election of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister is going to make bitcoin trading come with a premium in the country.

It is partially due to a full-fledged trading market that went underground abruptly owing to a blanket ban announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Panicked traders shuffled to a few known cryptocurrency exchanges such as ZebPay and UnoCoin to either withdraw or sell their bitcoins. Many of them to this date trade cryptocurrencies away from the watchful eye of law and lawmakers — and they believe a potential crypto ban at the behest of the Ministry of Finance would fuel their operations further.

“It does not matter what they [the Indian government] ban or what they accept,” says Anjuman Rishi, a Noida-based computer programmer, who got into bitcoin trading post demonetization. “I mean, they have banned alcohol in two Indian states, right? What have they done to remove billions of rupees worth of bootlegging market? Drinkers are going to drink. Bitcoin traders are going to trade.”

Rishi added that he would any day prefer a government-regulated cryptocurrency exchange over an underground bitcoin marketplace, explaining that peer-to-peer markets are expensive and unsafe. Excerpts from his conversation with CCN.com:

“I buy bitcoins at regular intervals, believing it would protect me from the recession next year. However, the prices quoted by underground bitcoin dealers are too high. When the price went above $8,00 in May, I tried to purchase a few units, only to find that the bid price was near $8,200. P2P offline exchanges rip us traders off especially in the times of the bitcoin price rise.”

Liquidity

Operators associated with a New Delhi-based peer-to-peer exchange told CCN.com that they were running the inherent legal and market risks associated with trading bitcoins. Mohammad Azeem Khan, a New Delhi-based exchange operator, said they sometimes run out of liquidity to match the bids, which leaves them with the only option to maximize the buying price.

“We would happily register ourselves as a regulated exchange if the government allows,” said Khan. “If banks work with us, it would be easier to handle larger orders. But until then, traders should appreciate us for bearing the risks.”

Santosh Kukreja, another New Delhi-based bitcoin exchange operator, believes the anti-bitcoin policies of the Modi government would make the asset more expensive in India than the rest of the world.

“The more they try to ban it, the better the bitcoin will flourish. The Modi government is good but they need to understand that they cannot shut down bitcoin. So why not just integrate it as Japan did?”

The alleged anti-bitcoin bill could make its way to the lower house of Indian parliament in the upcoming monsoon session, which will start on June 17 and will run until July 26.",2019-06-05 07:18:21+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-tax-authorities-say-crypto-traders-owe-them-93-million,"Japan-based entities have failed to report their crypto gains valued at 10 billion yen ($93 million) over the past several years by March 2019, local national newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports on June 5.

According to Asahi, about 30 crypto-related businesses and 50 individuals have not declared their revenues from cryptocurrency trading as of March, allegedly due to a high tax on this type of income.

To date, Japanese tax regulators reportedly consider crypto-related revenues as miscellaneous income, which is taxed at 55%. In accordance with the current law, local entities who earn more than 200,000 yen ($1,850) in such income on an annual basis are required to disclose it, the article notes.

As previously reported, in order to combat tax evasion in the industry, the Japanese government is preparing a new system that will authorize the National Tax Agency (NTA) to request revenue information from crypto exchanges, including names and addresses. Expected to be introduced in April 2020, the new law will allow the NTA to request data primarily for those users whose earnings from crypto amounted to more than 10 million yen ($88,700).

Asahi adds that the new system will be launched in January 2020, and it will also authorize the Japanese government to penalize those exchanges or crypto operators who fail to disclose the necessary information.

Earlier this year, the Japan Association of New Economy (JANE) asked the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) to consider reducing crypto taxes from the current 55% to 20%. The association has also asked the regulator to impose no taxation for crypto-to-crypto transactions.

Meanwhile, Japan, which is reportedly ranked as the second country globally for traffic to crypto exchanges after the United States, has recently passed new crypto regulation in the upper house of the parliament. The lower house suggested legal amendments intending to tighten local regulations on cryptocurrency trading activity, including margin trading.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-land-of-the-free-why-decentralization-matters-in-the-crypto-republic,"On May 30, Tezos implemented the amendment Athens A, as the result of a voting process that involved its baker nodes (the Tezos equivalent of “miners”) from Feb. 28 to May 30.

Although the actual relevance of the upgrade was quite small (see below), the Tezos community underlines that the test was a milestone. The smooth shift to Athens A indeed demonstrated the capability of Tezos to evolve without forking, thanks to the features of proposal/selection/voting/test/implementation this blockchain itself encompasses.

On the very same day, another fast-growing young company backed by a cryptocurrency, Iota, announced an important step toward total decentralization, substituting its Coordinator mechanism with the new Coordicide tool.

Coordicide will perform the same functions of its predecessor, ensuring transaction security and preventing double spending. However, the new protocol will allow the peculiar Iota block creation process to work in a fully decentralized and permissionless manner.

The debate over what constitutes the most suitable approach to the exchange business and the declarations of some big companies about decentralized exchanges (DEX) — both for or against it — only add to the fact that the topic of decentralization is still a paramount concern as crypto involves more people and use cases.

The evolution of cryptocurrencies as a business increases the amount of interest it generates. As in any business, this involves issues relating to power distribution. But such questions are difficult to answer in a simplistic way.

Benevolent dictators

Bitcoin (BTC) defines itself as a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, as per the title of its white paper; the new electronic cash would work in a trustless manner — the 2008's foundation document states — thanks to the consensus of the honest nodes that “control a majority of CPU power.""

The dream of money created by the people and for the people, freely circulating across the national borders, and untouchable by the rapacious economic monopolies was very appealing during the years following a dramatic financial crisis, which some may argue left the world suspicious toward governments and traditional financial actors.

However, while Bitcoin evolved from being a “cypherpunk” plaything to a relevant business entity, many concerns about its actual decentralization and “internal democracy” arose. In autumn 2016, for instance, two researchers — De Filippi from Harvard University and Loveluck from Université Paris-Saclay — published a paper that criticized the ""highly centralized and undemocratic"" technocratic approach to governance that, in their opinion, characterizes Bitcoin core developers.

Defining the small number of individuals in charge to decide which changes shall be incorporated into Bitcoin as a sort of ""benevolent dictator,"" the two researchers noticed:

""There exists, therefore, an obvious discrepancy between the libertarian vision of Bitcoin as a decentralised infrastructure that cannot be regulated by any third party institution, and the actual governance structure that dictates the technological development. [...] While the (a)political dimension of the former has been praised or at least acknowledged by many, the latter has remained, for a long time, invisible to the public: the technical decisions to be taken by the Bitcoin developers were not presented as political decisions, and were therefore never debated as such.""

Additionally, Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum's core team were labeled with the same title of “dictator” as a consequence of the decision to alter the mainchain to refund the victims of the DAO hack on June 2016.

The hack itself and the following debate between the supporters of Vitalik's choice and the defenders of the inviolability of the blockchain stressed, as an article on Wired noticed then, how much human weaknesses were still influencing processes that, theoretically, are managed only by the impersonal rules of mathematics.

A similar dispute emerged once again in 2018 about the vote on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-999), which aimed to unfreeze 587 multisig wallets attacked during the July 2017 Parity hack.

It is worth noting that the internal debates inside both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities brought the first relevant cases of a direct democracy instrument being applied, which is allowed by the blockchain architecture itself.

Even if the process of development and amendment of the core software remains the privilege of a qualified technical elite, all the nodes taking part in the network can veto a piece of code, refusing to upgrade and forking the blockchain. Therefore, every miner has voting rights that are equal to the hashing power and, if a new alternative blockchain is born, the free and democratic rules of the market would determine which is the more successful coin.

This happened, for instance, in July 2016, when the integrity supporters divorced from the amended Ethereum mainchain, giving birth to Ethereum Classic (as well as a new coin, ETC). Similarly, in August and October 2017, when people became unsatisfied with the introduction of SegWit on the Bitcoin network, they tried to find a solution to the block’s dimensions issue, creating, respectively, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG).

Voting, pickaxe in hand

This dream made of equal rights and free competition, however, is troubled by severe concerns over the actual distribution of mining power that sustains the different blockchains based on proof-of-work (PoW).

When considering Bitcoin, for instance, it's easy to understand the distance from its pioneer days and the present: On May 22, 2010, on the legendary first Pizza Day, the hash rate required to feed the whole network was about 109 MegaHash/s (MH/s), while eleven years after, on BTC Pizza Day 2019, the required computing power reached almost 52 ExaHash/s (51,934,800,000,000 MH/s).

While mining shifted from an amateurish activity to a capital-intensive business, the community has lost its role as a validator, which became much more of an exclusive prerogative of the giant mining pools that formed an oligopoly.

The data published by one of them show that, since April 2013, the three largest mining companies produced more than 50% of the blocks of the system (BTC Guild with 37.83%, SlushPool 11.54% and BitMinter 7.09%). The situation changed very little during the following years, despite the swirling turnover among the companies leading the industry.

The dynamic only seems to have scaled down in the very last few months; however, the dominance of the first three players (presently BTC.com, F2Pool and Poolin) is still above 40% of the blocks.

Ethereum was born with specific features preventing ASIC-based mining. However, its algorithm could do nothing to limit a concentration of power, which is even more accentuated than in Bitcoin's blockchain: Since the summer of 2017, two pools alone — Ethermine and SparkPool — produced over 50% of the new blocks almost continuously every month.

Even if vicious behavior that could undermine the whole crypto economy is rather unlikely in the two leading blockchains, recent events involving the smaller ETC demonstrated that the possibility of a 51% attack is far from theoretical. Last January, the exchange Coinbase revealed evidence of an ETC blockchain reorganization, which included double spending worth over $1.1 million.

Give me liberty or give me scalability

Proof-of-stake (PoS) could contribute to answering the concerns surrounding the rise in concentration of power within the mining industry and the risk that a malicious super-miner could hijack a whole blockchain.

The critical feature of PoS is to bond the rights to validate the new blocks — to “vote” in cases of a fork — to facilitating a “lottery” influenced by the dimension of the stakes “frozen” in the nodes, instead of asking the validators to compete through computing power.

This would bring some advantages — considering the fee levels, transaction speed and ecological footprint — as PoS forging is less demanding than PoW mining in terms of fixed capital and energy involved. Besides, the broader adoption of PoS would disrupt the mining business model, undermining the oligopolistic position of the pools that are dominating the market now.

However, even if the shift toward PoS would theoretically bring immediate democratization in the way blockchain is being run, in a long-term perspective, it is somewhat unclear if and how forging business would avoid spiralling toward concentration and bringing it from individual geeks to giant multinational companies.

Delegate proof-of-stake (DPoS), on the other hand, makes even more explicit the issue of the internal governance and the trade-off existing between scalability and decentralization. This consensus algorithm began to work for the first time in Bitshares, the first blockchain project designed between 2014 and 2015 by Daniel Larimer, also the creator of Steemit and EOS.

Since then, the crypto community divided itself between those who equate Larimer to Satoshi Nakamoto and those who see DPoS as an unforgivable sin against the very nature of the blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies must rely on blockchains that could guarantee that transactions will be unique and irreversible. However, to reach this advisable degree of security, it seems inevitable that a choice has to be made between either a time-consuming solution that implies a broad and distributed consensus or more effective architectures, which achieve efficiency while harming system decentralization.

The so-called “scalability trilemma” was first coined by Buterin and Trent McConaghy to explain how difficult — if not impossible — it would be to attain scalability, decentralization and security, all at the same time.

Since security is a sine qua non for every blockchain and scalability is a goal determining the success of a cryptocurrency, decentralization looks to be the odd one out.

In DPoS, limiting the validation process to an elite group of nodes — empowered also by the stakes delegated by other members — would enhance the performance, guaranteeing both security (as malicious nodes would be sanctioned economically) and preventing unchallengeable power positions (as delegators could revoke their sustain if they disagree with the delegate's policy).

The effectiveness and the actual match between this ideal model and its application could vary enormously from case to case, as everyone who lives in a country ruled by a representative parliamentary system would know.

Like in politics, criticism and scandals are commonplace in DPoS. Since its launch in June 2018, the largest DPoS/PoS currency existing on the market, EOS, has been plagued by recurrent embarrassments revolving around its governance model.

Decentralization doesn't seem to be a top priority for many DPoS supporters, indeed. For instance, last May, Neo founder Da Hongfei declared in an interview during Consensus 2019 that the high level of centralization of his blockchain is part of a strategy to compete against Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of superior performance. Despite some openings to decentralization during the summer of 2018, the Neo Foundation is still controlling half of the supply of NEO coins and the majority of the nodes running the network. ""That's intentional. We want to keep it more efficient,"" the Chinese entrepreneur said.

It's then easy to understand why Buterin himself bluntly criticized EOS, Neo and other DPoS projects during his keynote at the last Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco on Jan. 11, 2019. In the same speech, Ethereum's co-founder stated his support for options he defined as ""good, legitimate ways to make a blockchain fast,"" without harming decentralization.

One possible solution to the problem of scalability would be the creation of a “second layer” network, that allows transactions to occur off-chain and then ultimately settle on-chain.

Only, this secondary network would require some forms of centralization or trusted players to keep the mainnet both safe and decentralized, despite a significant growth in the number and speed of the performed transactions.

This is the path by which the Lightning Network is experimenting on Bitcoin's blockchain and what projects such as Plasma, Raiden, Counterfactual and Truebits aim to introduce into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Considering the “first layer,” Ethereum core developers have been working for a long time toward a more sophisticated solution. It encompasses both a new approach to PoS block validation, known as Casper, and the possibility for the network to operate through segmentation — called sharding — that allows every “island” of Ethereum to act as parallel blockchains, multiplying the performance of the system as a whole. The two development paths are presently joined under the label of Ethereum 2.0, the new spec of the cryptocurrency that is set to begin operating between 2020 and 2021.

Athenian democracy

Proof-of-stake is indeed quite similar to the original form of democracy deployed in Athens during the fifth century B.C. This form of government was based, in fact, not on a free election but on a draw that could appoint randomly selected citizen as magistrate or as delegates of the “people.” Fate was therefore the guarantor of equality (however, the city denied civil rights to women, slaves and foreigners).

Tezos' blockchain defines its distinctive feature as the ability to self-amend and self-govern its code evolution. However, is it unclear if the choice to label its first amendment as ""Athens"" was referring more to the random, PoS-ish nature of the historical Greek democracy or to the allure of participating in a free debate, which the ancient republic earned in collective consciousness.

On Feb. 28, Paris-based developer team Nomadic Labs proposed the migration from the original protocol ""alpha"" to ""Athens,"" injecting the network with the hashes referring to two alternative code updates.

The reform marked a milestone when considering the process rather than the content: Athens A aimed to reduce the number of Tezos’ native tokens (XTZ) accounted in one ""roll"" (the unit of account for Tezos’ proof-of-stake) and to increase the gas limit for each block, while the Athens B proposal contained only the gas limit increase amendment.

As every new piece of code aiming to upgrade Tezos protocol, Athens charged a reward for the developers, if approved: The request was a symbolic amount, sufficient to pay for a round of beers for the team (100 XTZ, less than $150).

The Tezos Foundation explicitly chose not to vote or to vote “Pass” during the different phases of the pool, to avoid influencing the results.

During the first phase of the process, aiming to choose which proposal should undergo the voting, 170 bakers representing almost half of the XTZ on stake, decided to bring Athens A to the ""Exploration Period.""

An even more significant number of participants (194 bakers, 87% of the stake) then expressed their opinion on the amendment, approving it and choosing to test Athens A in a sort of a “48-hours fork,” on a temporary parallel mainnet.

A final round of voting was required after the test (involving 216 bakers, representing 84.3% of the stake) to allow for an automatic update to the new code for all the nodes, which activated Athens A after 12:40 a.m. UTC on May 30.

The high level of participation in the vote among the Tezos community is even more remarkable considering the recent failure of another experiment on direct involvement of token holders.

Jacob Arluck from Tocqueville Group explained in a post on Medium the significance of Athens and stressed that the voting was indeed just a part of a more comprehensive process aiming to activate the Tezos community as a whole:

“It's really exciting because it's the first step towards this idea of self-upgrading, decentralized, internet-native economic infrastructure.”

Social networks, web-based platforms, on-chain signaling tools and baker-promoted pools are some of the instruments that guaranteed — in a somewhat unplanned and “decentralized” fashion — the debate among bakers and the delegator token holders.

People opposed to the governance architecture seemed to have been the decisive factor and Tezos' co-founder, Arthur Breitman, confirmed to Cointelegraph that the success of Athens relied on a mix of direct participation and the delegation mechanism:

""The fear of 'voter apathy' has permeated most discussions of on chain governance. Tezos guards against that issue by borrowing ideas from Gordon Tullock's concept of liquid democracy. The massive participation in the Athens vote and high degree of engagement from the community shows that this approach seems to be working.""

With great power comes great responsibility

The case of Tezos' amendment helps to focalize on the strong similarities between the debate about decentralization in blockchain and some well-established topics in sociology, economics and political science.

The dilemma of performance vs. decentralization, for instance, has strong analogies with the debate regarding the relationship between political freedom and economic development. Considering the diverging paths of different developing countries (recently, India and China), argue that autocracy could achieve higher performance than democracy, because it is not impaired by the need to mediate with the public opinion and different groups of interests.

Others, for instance, such as Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen, believe that freedom is a part of the development process as its final aim, as an instrument to check its advancement and as a guiding light to define its direction. Professor Sen also recognizes, however, that real freedom means more than regular formal pools, and it is possible to transfer his concern for genuine political participation to the blockchain-related issues presented above.

The effort that the Tezos community demonstrated in its first election is indeed quite similar to that of many opinion groups that try to resist “political laziness,” which affects many large democratic countries nowadays (Breitman reference to Tullock's article was not accidental).

It is, however, unpredictable if it would be possible to reach such a high degree of involvement in a broader and more mature network. Bitcoin PoW mining too was somehow a democratic activity when nodes were in the hundreds; the real issue arises when the number of users surpasses the number of people directly involved in system development.

Widespread adoption is likely to flood the system with users who are more concerned with issues like transaction cost and speed, user-friendly applications and global acceptance as a means of payment rather than obscure topics like 51% attacks or the scalability trilemma.

It is even possible that the average user could freely choose to renounce a significant amount of the libertarian features that have defined cryptocurrencies since their origin, for the sake of more comfortable handling.

In 1576, the French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie clandestinely published his “Discourse on Voluntary Servitude.” The text explained that tyrants (La Boétie also put elected governors among them) could retain their overwhelming power over their subjects because the people themselves forfeit their original freedom.

More than violence and intimidation, the French thinker argued that the real causes that brought the majority to accept servitude were the desire for profit and the custom of servitude itself.

Even without calling it real “servitude,” nowadays, we are still undoubtedly living in a centralized world, among centralized institutions and using everyday centralized technologies we don't completely understand. It is therefore quite hard that a new frame of mind, more suited to handle the power and the responsibility coming with decentralization, could arise overnight.

It is almost impossible to design a perfect voting system that, just using a set of rules, could force people to take responsibility for their freedom, limit media brainwash and prevent bribery. So, it seems quite unlikely that technology alone could assure the cryptocurrencies reach true decentralization under every possible scenario.

It is impossible to know which answer to the issue of blockchain governance will become dominant in the future; however, it is plausible that the fundamentals of human behavior will be part of it, alongside mathematics.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ex-bitmain-ceo-jihan-wu-set-to-launch-crypto-otc-platform-next-month-report,"Ex-Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu could launch his newest venture next month, according to a report by The Block on June 5.

One unnamed source told the website that the crypto services startup, called Matrix, “will be the biggest over-the-counter (OTC) desk and asset manager overnight.”

Matrix’s OTC offering is likely to be boosted by its close ties to bitcoin (BTC) mining company, Bitmain. The new business will reportedly offer custody and lending services to the Beijing-based giant, receiving a liquid pool in return.

Another of the four unnamed sources told The Block that such high levels of liquidity could result in lower crypto prices, giving Matrix a competitive advantage in Asia.

The Block notes that speculation remains over whether Wu will serve as chairman or CEO of the new company — as well as over whether Matrix would be allowed to operate in China, which has a history of clamping down on the cryptocurrency industry and crypto trading.

Last November, Wu was reportedly demoted from being a “director” at Bitmain to a “supervisor.”

Bitmain is one of the biggest players in the cryptocurrency industry due to its huge mining capabilities, and Wu continues to hold a 20.5% stake in the business.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/facebook-cryptocurrency-coming-in-june-report.html,"David Marcus, vice president of Messaging Products at Facebook, speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, April 18, 2017.

About a year ago, the company appointed former PayPal executive David Marcus to begin exploring opportunities with blockchain, the technological underpinning for cryptocurrency. Since then, several outlets have reported that the company has been building its own digital currency, which users will be able to store, trade, and exchange for regular currency, in part through Facebook apps including Messenger and WhatsApp. The report adds that Facebook is also planning physical ATM-like machines where users can buy the currency.

Facebook will announce its cryptocurrency later this month, and will allow employees working on the project to take their salary in the form of the new currency, according to a report in The Information .

Building an easy way for Facebook's more than 2 billion users to pay for things and exchange money between countries could help the company diversify beyond advertising, which today accounts for nearly all of its revenue. Facebook's ad model has faced criticism from privacy advocates, lawmakers and the press for the ways it collects and uses detailed information about users.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted payments as an important area for the company at its conference for developers earlier this year. However, operating chief Sheryl Sandberg and CFO David Wehner have ""been skeptical of the initiative internally,"" The Information said.

The report says Facebook is soliciting third-party organizations to act as ""nodes"" to help manage the cryptocurrency, and has discussed charging $10 million for the privilege.

Cryptocurrency nodes contain the computing power necessary to resolve complicated mathematical equations, which are used to validate transactions. They are typically decentralized and spread among thousands of parties, but Facebook is creating a foundation with named partners to help manage its currency, the report says.

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment.

When introduced, it will oblige financial institutions in the country to obtain licenses in advance for creating, advertising or operating platforms that issue or facilitate trading of cryptocurrencies. Licenses will be issued by the CBE’s board of directors. This marked the first step the Egyptian government made toward the legalization of activities related to cryptocurrencies.

Is Egypt defining its stance on crypto?

The state’s attitude toward the new sector of the economy, especially the financial structures in Egypt has always been unstable. Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies only began to be widely discussed in 2015, when the startup Yellow launched a bitcoin voucher service. In fact, it was the first service in the region of the Middle East and North Africa that allowed Egyptian citizens to buy bitcoin for the national currency through the use of vouchers.

According to the creator of the service, David El Achkar, only 10% of Egyptian citizens had bank cards and accounts. So, he saw the prospect for widespread use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country.

And he was proven right. Cryptocurrencies quickly became popular among the citizens, partially due to the unstable financial situation in the country. Crypto-enthusiast Ahmed Elmogy claimed that many Egyptians preferred money transfers in bitcoin as a convenient and cost-effective instrument. But even then, he noted that the government of the country was rather sceptical about new technology and digital currencies due to a poor understanding of the essence of this technology.

His words were confirmed in July 2017, when the Egyptian government made a tough statement that indicated that cryptocurrencies carried a certain risk, as they could be used by terrorist groups to finance their activities anonymously.

Since then, the financial situation in the country continued to deteriorate, and just a month after the announcement, in August 2017, news surfaced that Egypt would be getting its first crypto exchange — i.e., Yellow — which was supposed to start trading in September 2017. The exchange was supposed to be the first service where the Egyptian pound could be exchanged for digital currencies in a bitcoin\pound trading pair, without the use of other currencies like the United States dollar.

But in January 2018, a high-ranking official on religious law, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, called bitcoin trading illegal under Islam’s Sharia law, as bitcoin was not an “acceptable interface of exchange” and therefore unlawful to trade it. The cleric also said that bitcoin was a tool for money laundering and indicated that it was not under the control of any government, and so it could potentially undermine the economy of Egypt.

On the road to a national cryptocurrency

The government employed a strict attitude toward cryptocurrencies until the end of 2018, when, in late winter, the government had to look for ways to cut costs. Then, the representative of the CBE said that the government wanted to introduce a digital version of the Egyptian pound. The bank worked on a feasibility study of such a maneuver.

There were claims that Egypt believed that the digital version of its blockchain-based paper currency could help to minimize the government’s expenses on issuing paper money and transactions compared to coins and bank notes, which was the first step toward a cashless society.

But further development and research stumbled. The CBE did not introduce and did not issue its cryptocurrency, perhaps because of the low awareness and understanding of blockchain technology or possibly due to real economic problems, because of which a digital national cryptocurrency was not the primary goal.

As it turned out, the government did not abandon the idea of a national cryptocurrency and in May 2019, it announced the intention to issue licenses for fintech firms and banks, which in turn would allow them to issue and trade cryptocurrencies, as well as process transactions. The purpose of the future law is to establish state control over the development of new technologies in the financial and banking sectors. The law is expected to become the basis for digital payments in the country.

A possible reason for this step by Egyptian authorities is the interest of neighboring countries in the development of blockchain industry. For example, representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced at the beginning of the year a cooperation in order to create a joint cryptocurrency, which will be used as cross-border digital asset between the banks of both countries.

Experts from both countries discussed the jointly integrated strategy, including initiatives in such areas as civil aviation, financial literacy for young people and the creation of a digital currency intended for cross-border payments. Earlier, UAE-based payment company UAE Exchange created a blockchain payment system together with Ripple.

But the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Egypt is still uncertain — i.e., it is not defined. The CBE has yet to determine its position on digital currencies and their place in the country's economy. But, what is pleasing, however, is that the authorities have moved away from the path of prohibitions that will enable exchanges to conduct their business in the country.

At the same time, some on Twitter have questioned whether the prohibition of cryptocurrency trading in Egypt was ever present:

Actually - I can't find any evidence of an Egypt Crypto ban. The #libraryofcongress says

1. CBE has issued a warning about the danger of crypto

2. Various Egyptian religious authorities have 'banned' crypto - but a fatawa isn't a legal document — Vikram Rangraj (@VRangraj) May 31, 2019

Rules are welcome

So, the licensing of cryptocurrency exchanges is an ambiguous thing. For ordinary users the most important issue is the safety of their funds. Licenses do not contribute to this: Hackers might break into any exchange and do not pay attention to their legal status, just as in the recent attack on a highly compliant exchange, Binance. Having crypto exchanges without any sort of regulation in this day and age would be unthinkable, since such a young industry is full of fraud.

Therefore, it seems like the Egyptian authorities have managed to overcome the sharp denial of cryptocurrencies and have recognized the importance of fintech companies in the country.

The development of licenses in Egypt also marks a step toward the development of a digital economy, which is widely discussed in most western countries. Surely the confirmation of digital payments, exchanges and transfers requires deep learning and testing. But the Egyptian mood regarding cryptocurrencies has been changing for a while, ever since the CBE reported on developing a digital version of the national currency.

The main problem the government wanted to solve was the increasing complication of printing bank notes. The cheaper it is to create money, the less destructive will the inflation be for the country's economy. Besides that, the transfer to a cashless society provides many more tools to maintain the general welfare of the country. The regulation of cryptocurrencies in Egypt isn’t expected until the end of 2019, but the licenses must become sufficient until that time comes.

No more prejudice

It is clear that there are still a lot of questions and uncertainties about both the new law and the Egyptian government’s approach to cryptocurrencies. But some experts are optimistic about any attempt of the state to welcome the new technology.

According to analytical ratings website ICObench, there are currently only three initial coin offerings (ICOs) that are related to Egypt. In comparison, there are nearly 750 ICOs being held in the U.S. The current disparity is vast, but maybe a more favorable stance from the government might encourage new ICOs to emerge.

The fact that Egypt has begun to switch its approach may signal that it is ready to accept the progress of crypto, gain new streams of income and even open up a new sector of the economy. Perhaps such a long wait to remove the ban was not accidental. The government was possibly studying how other progressive countries, such as the UAE, successfully issued licenses for cryptocurrencies exchanges, which ensured the security of digital assets. And now, Egypt is also potentially ready to repeat that successful experience while taking minimal risks.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/greenpages-cash-will-help-you-find-merchants-accepting-bitcoin-cash/,"Greenpages.cash Will Help You Find Merchants Accepting Bitcoin Cash

Poloniex’s peer-to-peer margin system includes both lenders and borrowers, the lenders of which are pooled together and rewarded in interest for lending out their funds. In order for a user to borrow the margin funds being lent, he or she must hold a certain amount of collateral to provide a level of certainty that the debt will be able to be repaid at a later date.

On May 26, the margin-tradable Clams (CLAM) market dropped by nearly 77 percent in value in just 45 minutes on Poloniex, causing a flurry of liquidations designed to cut losses in order to repay the lender.

However, the speed and magnitude of the crash were too severe for Poloniex’s automatic liquidation system to function properly in the illiquid market. This resulted in the 1,800 BTC loss that has yet to be repaid to the lenders.

In the post, Poloniex stated:

“The velocity of the crash and the lack of liquidity in the CLAM market made it impossible for all of the automatic liquidations of CLAM margin positions to process as they normally would in a liquid market.”

In total, this erased 16.202 percent of the entire margin lending pool and affected 0.4 percent of all Poloniex users, the post revealed.

Unfortunately for both lenders and borrowers in this case, much of the collateral provided by the borrowers was in the CLAM cryptocurrency itself. Since CLAM is now trading at $4.96, a value 80 percent less than moments before the crash, it’s unlikely the borrowers are capable of repaying said debt.

“Lenders impacted will see the reduction in their accounts when they next log in,” the post added.

Further, Poloniex said that it is seeking to contact those that defaulted on the loans in question.

“We’re pursuing the defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders. As we recover funds, we will return them to affected lenders. We’re also exploring other ways to help defray margin lender losses,” the exchange said. “We will continue to communicate with impacted lenders on the status of these efforts.”

To combat another situation like this going forward, Poloniex is taking steps to protect its margin users including removing illiquid markets such as BTS, CLAM, FCT, and MAID, add adding layers of processes and protections to monitor the risk in its margin markets.

Ted Budd testified to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on purported issues with current tax laws on cryptocurrencies, as per a video of the testimony released on June 4.

Congressman Budd argued that cryptocurrencies should have a de minimis tax exemption like foreign currencies.

Budd commented that he cosponsored bill H.R.3708, or the “Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act,” which would extend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat personal cryptocurrency purchases like personal transactions in foreign currency, which are not taxed.

Budd highlighted the fact that, since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers cryptocurrency to be a type of property, cryptocurrencies do not currently qualify for a de minimis tax exemption.

Instead, since they are properties, the IRS requires persons who use cryptocurrency to buy fiat money, or goods and services, to calculate and then pay the tax liability associated with this “property” transaction.

Relatedly, Budd commented on the issue of double taxation. Since cryptocurrencies are taxed as properties, cryptocurrency transactions result in a “double taxation” situation in which the IRS treats the transaction for the buyer as both a sale and a purchase. Budd argues that this results in unfairly demanding record-keeping practices for taxpayers, and is a deterrent to participating in blockchain-based business.

Budd argued that purchases with cryptocurrencies should be treated as ordinary purchases. He referred to bill H.R.7361, or the “Virtual Value Tax Fix of 2018” bill, which would include cryptocurrency in the scope of tax-deferrals under the IRS Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 1031, regarding “like-kind exchanges.” Without a solution of this kind, Budd says that blockchain transactions are subjected to almost 40% sales tax.

Budd also briefly remarked that blockchain technology development is a national economic issue, saying that it would be a problem if blockchain innovation moved primarily to countries such as Malta and Singapore.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, executive director of Coin Center Jerry Brito discussed a bill that would provide a de minimis tax exemption for cryptocurrencies at the crypto conference Consensus 2019 on May 13. The bill, the reintroduced Token Taxonomy Act (TTA), would likewise seek to treat cryptocurrencies the same as foreign currencies for the purpose of personal transactions.",,https://www.coindesk.com/s-l-benfica-is-the-first-major-european-football-club-to-accept-cryptocurrency,"S.L. Benfica has become the first major European soccer team to accept cryptocurrency payments, after announcing a partnership with the UTRUST payment platform.

The club, the most popular in Portugal, will now allow fans to purchase its merchandise with cryptocurrency, paying with the UTRUST token (UTK) in addition to bitcoin and ethereum.

According to Benfica, the decision to accept cryptocurrency payments is based on a need to upgrade its e-commerce strategy and expand its global audience. Currently, the Portuguese team has a fan base of 14 million and stands as the most decorated club in Portugal.

The team hopes to broaden its audience by improving the user experience and appealing to cryptocurrency holders.

User Experience

The fan base is key in the decision to adopt a new payment method, said S.L. Benfica CEO, Domingos Soares de Oliveira.

“We recognize that many of our supporters are now digital users first so we want to be ahead of the curve when it comes to adopting novel technologies and giving our supporters the best online experience,” Oliveira said.

As stated by the club, the addition of cryptocurrency would also get rid of common issues with credit card payments, like chargebacks and fraudulent payments. On the other hand, it would allow funds to be deposited to Benfica’s bank account in fiat money the same day of each purchase done in its online store.

“We look forward to accepting our first cryptocurrency payment,” the club’s CEO said.

The partnership is also a step forward in the reach of financial services within the blockchain ecosystem, according to UTRUST Co-Founder and CEO, Nuno Correia.

“This partnership with Portugal’s number one football club marks a major milestone for UTRUST and the blockchain ecosystem as a whole,” Correia said.

The football pitch has been one of the most welcoming groups to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The popular Portuguese football club only one of the many European clubs that are betting on financial alternatives to reach new audiences.",2019-06-06 19:30:44+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-investigating-major-tax-crimes-as-part-of-crypto-focused-tax-enforcement-taskforce,"Australia’s tax agency, the Australian Tax Office (ATO), is investigating 12 major international tax avoidance schemes, with a key focus on cryptocurrency-enabled activities. The news was reported by local broadsheet The Sydney Morning Herald on June 6.

The ATO’s intensified cross-border investigations were reportedly revealed following a meeting of the J5 — also known as “The Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement.”

As previously reported, the J5 is an international taskforce of tax enforcement authorities from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was established in July 2018 in a bid to tackle cryptocurrency- and cybercrime-related risks, in particular their role in transnational tax crimes and money laundering.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the latest J5 meeting revealed the coalition was intensively sharing data to pursue 60 global investigations, with the ATO reportedly directly involved in 12.

ATO deputy commissioner Will Day has reportedly revealed that at least one of the investigations involves a global financial institution and its intermediaries, which is believed to have helped clients conceal assets and income data. In his statement, Day singled out the risks posed by cryptocurrencies in particular, noting that:

“We're seeing the use of cryptocurrencies in ways that we haven't seen before. At the Australian level, there is definitely legitimate use for investment in cryptocurrencies, but we're also seeing the use of them to facilitate tax crimes.""

The J5’s cooperation has reportedly enabled more organized and intensive data exchange and analysis across borders. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the Dutch tax authorities recently shuttered a crypto mixer due to the combined efforts of the J5 members.

Day emphasized that the taskforce’s activities means that “at no other time have criminals been at greater risk of being caught.”

As reported earlier this spring, the ATO has revealed it is seeking to contact crypto traders personally about tax issues as part of a new data collection scheme.

In conjunction with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, the agency is identifying crypto traders using data sourced from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.",,https://bgr.com/2019/06/06/ios-13-features-iphone-bitcoin-wallet-apps-possible-with-cryptokit/,"Apple’s press event on Monday was filled with announcements, most of them on the software side of things, as the iPhone maker showed us some of the main features of its upcoming operating systems updates. Apple also launched a brand new Mac Pro generation and introduced new developers tools for apps, including support for easily turning iPad apps into Mac apps.

But Apple also quietly unveiled a CryptoKit framework that will allow developers to build cryptographic operations right into their apps. It’s too early to say whether Apple is working on its own crypto projects, like an Apple digital coin that would work across its devices and services, but it sure looks like a device like the iPhone could soon act as wallets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

CryptoKit, detailed over on Apple’s developer portal will support “common cryptographic operations”:

Compute and compare cryptographically secure digests. Use public-key cryptography to create and evaluate digital signatures, and to perform key exchange. In addition to working with keys stored in memory, you can also use private keys stored in and managed by the Secure Enclave. Generate symmetric keys, and use them in operations like message authentication and encryption.

Just because Apple is bringing cryptography tools to developers doesn’t mean that it’s interested in creating a Bitcoin alternative of its own, as is the case with Facebook, for example. Also, cryptography is involved in the brand new Find My app that can locate lost or stolen iPhones and Macs anywhere on the planet, even if they’re offline, and without any of the data reaching Apple’s servers.

In other words, there are plenty of uses for cryptography other than digital coins such as Bitcoin. Conversely, this incredibly sophisticated way of tracking a lost device might prove to be a crucial advantage to turning the iPhone into a crypto wallet that can hold Bitcoin, adding a security layer to the device that has no rival.

Apple also updated its icons set to include Bitcoin:

Developers, including crypto exchanges, may use CryptoKit to turn iPhones and Macs into secure wallets for cryptocurrency, and the move wouldn’t be surprising. Well before Samsung launched the Galaxy S10 in February, leaks revealed the phone would feature a built-in crypto wallet, and Samsung delivered precisely that, complete with support for decentralized apps.

When someone visits the scam website, it automatically downloads an executable file on the victim’s computer, and when it is installed, it infects the computer with the malware. The installation prompt even shows the logo of Cryptohopper to trick the victims.

Per the report, the installer installs a Trojan called Vidar. This steels information from the computer including browser cookies, browser history, browser payment information, saved login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, text files, browser form autofill information, and Authy 2FA authenticator databases.

It also installs two more Qulab trojans for mining and clipboard hijacking. Both these Trojans are executed every minute to collect user data.

All the collected information is then uploaded to a remote server from where the attackers scrape the data.

The attackers are cautious enough to delete every piece of data from the victim’s computer, leaving behind a directory of empty folders.

Moreover, to directly steal cryptocurrencies, the Trojans automatically replace the attacker’s crypto wallet address on the clipboard when it detects the victim has typed in a cryptocurrency wallet address.

The report recorded a few addresses substituted on the victim’s clipboard which consists of wallet addresses of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, DOGE, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin Gold, QTUM, and Ripple.

The address associated with Bitcoin holds around 33 BTC worth $253,238 at current market rate. However, it is not confirmed that the coins were collected from scamming users.

The rise of malware

Crypto platforms and users are very lucrative targets for cyber scammers to attack with malware. Last month, Finance Magnates reported that the developers of notorious crypto jacking malware Shellbot updated it to not only mine crypto remotely but also to shut down host’s ongoing mining activities to utilize more processing power.

Another Trojan was discovered earlier this year, which was targeting Android devices to steal cryptocurrencies and fiats.",2019-06-06 13:00:11+00:00,https://mashable.com/article/zengo-cryptocurrency-wallet/,"Cryptocurrency wallet software can be intimidating to use. With crypto, you are your own bank, which sounds great until you realize that you and you alone are responsible to keep your money safe.

In practice, this typically means you need to go through the process of creating a new wallet, setting up a password and writing down a lengthy list of words known as a seed phrase. You also have to store the seed phrase in a secure manner, because it's the only backup for your money in case something goes wrong with the wallet.

Israel-based startup ZenGo has just launched a cryptocurrency wallet that uses some clever cryptography to make this process much simpler.

A very short primer: A cryptocurrency wallet is, essentially, a pair of public and private cryptographic keys. The public key is your cryptocurrency address (technically, it's a part of the address but let's keep it simple), the same one you use for receiving funds. The private key is a long string of symbols that lets you spend the funds residing at that address.

The private key is simple but impractical to use on an everyday basis. If someone takes a photo of it, or hacks your PC or phone and grabs it, they can spend your cryptocoins at will. This is why we have wallet software, which rarely (if ever) actually shows or requires you to type in your private key. Instead, you choose some sort of password to protect your funds, but your private key remains in your possession, typically as the seed phrase mentioned above. So if your phone or PC gets stolen, you can reinstall the wallet software, punch in the seed phrase, and access your money.

The seed phrase, while a little bit easier to write down than the private key, is also long and hard to remember. So people typically write it down on a piece of paper that's once again, easy to get lost or stolen. If you have the misfortune to lose your seed phrase and (for example) the phone with your wallet software, your money is gone forever.

Keeping it simple — with your face

With ZenGo, the process of creating your crypto wallet consists of these simple steps: Install the app, enter your email, click on the link you've received via e-mail, and have the app scan your face. Once you've done that, you can start receiving and sending Bitcoin and Ethereum which are currently the only two cryptoassets supported by ZenGo. And if you lose your phone, you can install the app on a new phone, have it scan your face, and your funds will immediately be restored.

Now, you may have seen certain services or wallets that aren't complicated to use — one of the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, comes to mind. But that's different: Coinbase does not let you control your own private keys. This approach creates a different kind of danger: If Coinbase gets hacked or compromised in some way, there's no way for you to retrieve your funds. In other words, you are not your own bank — Coinbase is your bank.

ZenGo solves both the issues outlined above. Instead of the seed phrase, it uses the face scan. And instead of storing all the cryptographic info derived from that face scan on its servers, it divides the pieces of the puzzle needed to restore your wallet between its servers and your iCloud account. This is done by using a technology called threshold signatures, in which several parties are needed to create the private key. In this case, ZenGo's servers and your mobile phone must both cooperate to generate the key.

Thanks to all of this tech in the background, ZenGo doesn't require you to use any kind of password or key, ever. Your face is your password, even when you need to send funds, and even when you need to restore them.

Using ZenGo, I've received and sent ether without having to use a password. Image: Stan schroeder/mashable

I've tested ZenGo out with Ethereum and, outside of a few early error messages when signing up, it worked as advertised. Receiving and sending funds to my address worked as if using any other wallet. Upon sending a small amount of ether to my ZenGo wallet, the app immediately sent me a notification that funds are coming in. And to send some ether out, all I had to do was choose a receiving address and tap a button; after a successful face scan, the funds were on their way.

Having your funds secured by a face scan can be scary, especially knowing that technologies like Apple's Face ID have been defeated before. But ZenGo says it uses a very secure face scanning tech called ZoOm. ZenGo CEO Ouriel Ohayon told me via email me that ZoOm's been ""battle tested over millions of users including banks"" and it ""cannot"" be gamed.

Cryptocurrencies can be frightening and complex for new users, and wallet software, being an entryway into owning crypto, should be as simple as possible without sacrificing security. ZenGo is by far the simplest cryptocurrency wallet software I've used, both when it comes to everyday use and restoring your wallet.

There's room for improvement, of course. The software itself is very sparse in terms of features (though that may be a good thing, too), and only two major cryptocoins are supported. Ohayon told me more assets will be supported very soon, and an Android version of the app should be launched in the ""next few weeks."" Also, more features are coming, some of which are ""not possible"" with traditional wallet apps.

Even though ZenGo's cryptography is sound and open to public evaluation (it's entirely open source), it'd be hard to recommend storing larger amounts of money on it until it's a bit more tried and tested on the battlefield. Overall, though, ZenGo's focus on keeping things simple while using innovative cryptographic solutions to secure your funds makes it a welcome addition to the cryptocurrency space.

If passed, India’s bill will order cryptocurrency holders to declare their crypto assets within 90 days and to dispose the assets “in accordance with the prescription of central government,” the report notes. The bill includes a penalty system that reportedly envisions fines worth a three-fold amount from the “loss caused to the system” or from the gains of crypto holders, according to The Block.

Considered as “cognisable and non-bailable,” the offense can also lead to a 10-year jail sentence for those who break the new rules.

The new bill reportedly proposed the development of a new national cryptocurrency called the Digital Rupee, while India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), reportedly postponed its plans to release a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in early 2019.

The first inter-ministerial consultations on the bill banning cryptocurrencies in India started in April 2019, when local news agencies reported about a new bill that intends to completely ban cryptocurrencies in the country.

On June 4, the RBI officially denied its involvement or knowledge of a draft government bill, claiming that the bank has had no communication with the central government about the new law and had not received a copy of the bill.",,https://www.coindesk.com/facebooks-globalcoin-crypto-will-be-tied-to-multiple-currencies-exec,"Yet more details have emerged about Facebook’s upcoming cryptocurrency, said to be called GlobalCoin, and this time they come directly from the company.

Speaking to German business magazine WirtschaftsWoche earlier this week, Laura McCracken, Facebook’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, confirmed that the planned stablecoin will not be tied to any single fiat currency, but will instead be linked to a basket of currencies in order to prevent volatility.

The executive also added to recent reports that GlobalCoin would be revealed later this month, saying that a white paper for the token would be published on June 18.

McCracken was talking to the magazine at a trade conference in Amsterdam.

The confirmation comes after reports listing some of the executives said to be working on the effort. These include MIT’s Christian Catalini as chief economist and Sunita Parasuraman, manager of the Switzerland-based foundation leading the token project.

Facebook may further set up physical portals for users to purchase the cryptocurrency, as well as charging third parties as much as $10 million for the privilege of supporting the network as nodes, according to The Information.

Elsewhere, Russian news site RBC reported Thursday that head of oil firm Rosneft, Igor Sechin, told the St. Petersburg Economic Forum that Facebook’s cryptocurrency could possibly be used in oil transactions “in the near future.” Sechin, however, seemed to be talking generally about how big U.S. tech firms like Google, Apple and Facebook are making moves into the energy industry.

He added the skeptical note:

“At the same time, someone might get the illusion that technology giants will make the energy market fundamentally more transparent and efficient, becoming a panacea for solving the acute problems of modern times.”

There’s a lot of debate over whether bitcoin mining is bad for the environment. Many bureaucrats and mainstream media pundits claim that mining is wasteful and bitcoin’s energy consumption cannot be ignored. However, these claims have been refuted in the past and on June 6, Coinshares published a report that details mining is not environmentally imprudent but rather 74.1% of the Bitcoin mining industry is “heavily” driven by renewable energy sources.

Bitcoin Mining Operations and Renewable Energy

There’s been clamoring over the years concerning bitcoin mining and how people believe the energy resources the industry consumes is reckless. For instance, there have been countless reports stemming from China that allege Chinese politicians are negative about the mining industry within the country. For years now the majority of bitcoin miners have been based in China and recently the country’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) wrote on April 9 that the department believes bitcoin mining “wastes resources and pollutes the environment.” This week Coinshares, a crypto investment products and research company, published an in-depth report that states otherwise and highlights how renewable energy is dominant within the bitcoin mining industry.

Throughout the report, Coinshares explained how the firm researched the efficiency, electricity consumption, electricity sources, geographical distribution, and composition of the mining network on the BTC chain. At the moment the study explains that the market average since November for the cost of creation at $0.05 per KWh and “depreciation schedules has decreased from approximately $6,800 to approximately $5,600.” This means at current prices mining bitcoin is very profitable and the researchers note that even older mining rigs are competitive. The biggest takeaway from Coinshare’s report is that most mining facilities are located near renewable energy suppliers. Coinshare’s June 2019 study states:

We calculate a conservative estimate of the renewables penetration in the energy mix powering the Bitcoin mining network at 74.1%, making Bitcoin mining more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.

China Still Dominates Manufacturing, Older Mining Rigs Become Cashflow Positive, and the Penetration of Next-Gen Miners

According to the report, BTC miners captured an estimated $5.5 billion in block rewards and roughly $300 million in transaction fees. 97% of the $5.5 billion consisted of newly minted coins stemming from the block reward. While observing the mining industry Coinshares spotted two macro trends which include a large number of liquidations and bankruptcies and the “first at-scale deployment of the latest generation mining gear.” Coinshares also discussed the ~40% drop in hashrate during Q4 2018 and two separate drivers sparking the recent spike in hashrate. “The re-starting of much of the previously shuttered mining gear as the Bitcoin price recovery has caused even previous-generation mining units to become cashflow positive at commonly attainable wet-season electricity prices,” Coinshare’s report notes. The report also highlights the penetration of next-generation machines and asserts that the “deployment of next-generation mining gear at appreciable scale, predominantly in Sichuan, in line with the advent of the wet-season” was also a contributing factor.

Coinshares says that it is true there is uncertainty when it comes to Chinese miners and the government’s policy toward them. However, unlike the mainstream media, Coinshare underlines the big difference between local municipalities and the national government’s treatment toward the mining industry. The report emphasizes that China still plays a leading role within the mining sector and claims:

On the other hand, Chinese dominance in the hardware manufacturing sector remains as strong as ever and is showing no immediate signs of reduction. Even if the most damning rumours of Bitmain’s struggles were true (we have our doubts), it would have minimal impact on Chinese dominance in the miner manufacturing sector as all other relevant manufacturers are also Chinese.

The report also reveals an estimated electricity draw from the mining industry which assumes that currently the entire bitcoin mining industry is consuming roughly 4.7 GW worldwide. With the renewable power generation in the mining industry capturing more than four times the global average, the number has still has dropped a hair since last November. Last year’s November report detailed the amount of renewable energy-dependent miners was 77.8%, but Coinshares notes this is due to a recent upstart of smaller mining clusters using fossil fuels.

“Overall, our findings reaffirm our view that Bitcoin mining is acting as a global electricity buyer of last resort and therefore tends to cluster around comparatively under-utilised renewables infrastructure,” the research report concludes. “This could help turn loss-making renewables projects profitable and in time—as the industry matures and settles as permanent in the public eye — could act as a driver of new renewables developments in locations that were previously uneconomical.”

According to a report from The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, the ATO is working on 12 tax avoidance cases involving abuse of crypto assets. Notably, the agency’s deputy commissioner, Will Day, said at least one of the cases involve a “global financial institution,” which is suspected of hiding assets and income details of taxpayers.

The ATO’s crackdown is part of a global investigation by tax authorities from five countries, including Australia, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada. These agencies, known as the “J5,” are pursuing a further 50 similar investigations globally.

The agencies came together last year to form a collective response against growing tax avoidance, cybercrime, and cryptocurrency abuse, according to the report, and have been sharing international data to pursue tax evaders.

Day cited evidence as showing that individuals in Australia have been enabling tax avoidance or teaming up with people in other countries to conduct criminal activities.

“At no other time have criminals been at greater risk of being caught. In Australia, they are often intermediaries who are playing a role between the tax evader and an offshore entity,” he said.

Last month, authorities in the Netherlands shut down a cryptocurrency “mixer,” which was used to obfuscate the source of cryptocurrency transactions.

Europol, which was involved in the action, alleged that much of the money that passed through Bestmixer.io “had a criminal origin or destination,” contending that “in these cases, the mixer was probably used to conceal and launder criminal flows of money.”

According to The Herald, information from Bestmixer is being examine and shared between J5 members

Australian tax form image via Shutterstock",2019-06-07 11:00:29+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/vancouver-first-city-with-a-cryptocurrency-atm-considering-ban,"Bitcoin ATMs have become “an ideal money-laundering vehicle,” according to the Vancouver Police Department, prompting a proposed city-wide ban by the mayor, and potential federal legislation, The Star reports.

The 76 machines within the city limits have come under police fire twice already this past year due to perceived regulatory issues. Though, most recently in February 2019, Sergeant Alvin Shum took aim not only at Bitcoin ATMs, but also the ideological underpinnings of blockchain generally. He wrote, in a report to the Vancouver Police Board:

“Given the lack of a central authority, there is no controlling organization who can monitor or regulate the transfer of funds to ensure a legitimate transaction. This creates a prime opportunity for the criminal element to capitalize on remaining anonymous, as they work to defraud unsuspecting citizens, launder money, and make large-sum anonymous transactions.”

This lack of regulation, Shum said, will allow for the incubation of organized and petty crime. Indeed, he points to the rising trend of cryptocurrency police filings in Vancouver year over year, which increased 350% from 2016 to 2017, and saw a further 250% increase in 2018.

Current reporting rates indicate the Metro Police will receive 840 reports this year, on track for a 300% increase in reports from 2018.

It is unclear how many of these crimes were directly tied to the use of cryptocurrency ATMs, though Shum spoke of a “high-pressure” tactic employed by fraudsters to direct victims to withdraw large amounts of cash and deposit it in a Bitcoin ATM to a predefined Bitcoin address. These scams target the most vulnerable segments of the population including recent immigrants and the elderly.

Since Shum wrote to the police council, 15 new machines have been added to the Vancouver metro area, according to coinatmradar.com.

In January, the city council suggested a bylaw to “regulate the use and operation of cryptocurrency ATMs, including the requirement for a business licence, requirement for signage to advertise common frauds, requirement for identifications to be used to verify the sender and receiver of funds and requirement of security features.”

Four months later, at a May 28 council meeting, Mayor Kennedy Stewart pushed for the outright ban crypto ATMs in the city. Defenders of the machines cite the utility for people who have transaction limits on their bank accounts, and the convenience for conducting cryptocurrency transactions. The third largest metropolitan area in Canada, Vancouver only hosts about 12% of the nation’s total crypto ATMs.

The first bitcoin ATM ever was installed at a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013, which contained a built-in palm scanner designed to prevent users from processing more than $3000 CAD per day.

“We don’t want drug dealers sending a bunch of coke to the States and then withdrawing cash,” said one of the machine’s owners as it was unveiled at its location in 2013. “We don’t want these to turn into money laundering machines; that’s the worst thing that could happen.”

Currently, Vancouver lacks standardization for the types of transactions that can be performed on its ATMs. Some machines require a cellphone number and text verification for transactions over $1,000, while for others push the limit to $3,000, according to CoinATMRadar.com. A few machines advertise no limits at all, according to The Star.

A decision regarding the regulation, monitoring, or ban of crypto ATMs is currently being researched by city staff who will report back in the fourth quarter of 2019, Alvin Singh, the mayor’s director of communications, told The Star.

The Bitcoin correction I’ve been forecasting seems to be underway. BTC has fallen from a high of $9,000 to a recent correction low of $7,500. And the correction may not be over yet.

Use this as a buying opportunity.

Because, longer term, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now in a long-term bull market. And one key reason is their powerful potential to truly disrupt the financial system as we know it today.

Still, many analysts don’t see it that way. They think it’s apps like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) Pay, Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Pay and Alipay that could challenge the global financial system, even “replacing banks” with their new payment platforms.

I believe that’s a collective delusion. Truth be told, they’re not replacing banks; they’re becoming banks.

Take Alipay, for example, covered in a recent Bloomberg report. It’s amassing client deposits in the hundreds of billions of dollars with its popular payment app. It’s leaving bankers out of the loop, not giving them a cut in the transactions. And it’s been very successful.

So people wonder: “Who’s profiting from all this?”

I’ll tell you who: It’s companies like Apple, Google and an affiliate of China’s Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA), which owns and manages Alipay.

Alipay amasses its customers’ deposits. It invests the money in short-term money markets. It even makes loans to consumers.

So, the financial media says it’s one of the “great financial innovations” of our time; the “leading edge of financial technology (Fintech).

Really?

Sounds just like a traditional bank to me.

Remember: A bank is simply an institution that takes deposits from the public and then invests or lends that money out at a higher rate.

And guess what? That’s precisely what some of these so-called “revolutionary” Fintech companies are doing.

As with banks, once you make a deposit, you have no say over what’s done with your money. Nor is the money kept in the institution’s vaults available for withdrawal by all.

It’s fractional banking, meaning your money isn’t really there. At the end of the day, all you have is a chit — a claim to the money you deposited.

I repeat: Alipay uses essentially the same business model …

In fact, it is one of the world’s most successful Fintech companies in this sector. Heck, until China's central bank changed the rules, Alipay was serving about half of all the country’s small- and medium-sized companies, according to Bloomberg.

Now they’re required to hold cash reserves with the central bank.

Again, just like traditional banks.

There is NO substantive difference between a traditional bank and a payment app such as Alipay. They work the same way.

But that’s not the big problem.

What really worries me is that both Fintech companies like Alibaba and traditional banks share the same flaw: You’re required to entrust your money to a third party, and it’s this third party that actually controls it. Not you.

Most people argue that the difference between a bank and a Fintech company is that, with Fintechs, the assets and payments are digital. Also not true. Nearly all the money you have in a bank account is also digitized.

Here’s the real problem with today’s financial system: A vast network of intermediaries stands between you and your money.

And the new Fintech companies have done zilch to disrupt this critical aspect of the system. All they’ve done is to create a more efficient digital network and undercut obscenely high bank transaction fees.

The business model of these Fintechs is simply to beat traditional banks at their own game.

They are not revolutionizing the financial system. Not even close.

The only invention with the potential to truly disrupt traditional banks is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the basis for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

And the major innovation Bitcoin — like other crypto assets — brings to the table is not just a fully digital payment system. (Alipay, PayPal Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Facebook Inc's (NASDAQ: FB) upcoming GlobalCoin do that as well.)

Rather, it’s decentralization.

In fact, the digitalization and decentralization of crypto assets are a means to an end.

The goal is to create a technology that -- unlike your deposits at a bank or Fintech company -- when you own a crypto asset in your wallet, you’re the ONLY one who controls it.

There are absolutely no intermediaries between you and your money.

Indeed, owning crypto assets is akin to holding gold bullion bars or coins. As long as you store your crypto in a wallet you own, nobody has access to it other than you.

Traditional banks and their new Fintech competitors have final say over what happens with your money. With cryptocurrencies, you’re the only one who makes those decisions.

That’s the real innovation. And that’s why cryptocurrencies are likely to challenge — and ultimately overtake — the likes of Apple Pay or Alipay.

Think of it this way, Fintech companies are the same old trains trying to run on digital rails.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the infrastructures for an entirely new financial system.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/study-over-74-of-bitcoin-mining-is-powered-by-renewable-energy,"Cryptocurrency investment products and research firm CoinShares estimates that 74.1% of bitcoin (BTC) mining is powered by renewable energy in its bi-annual mining report published on June 5.

The report also claims that “at current prices, the average miner is highly profitable, with even older gear and high-cost producers currently able to make positive ROI.” The paper also notes that bitcoin mining operations are concentrated where there is ample renewable energy supply. Still, the report also notes:

“The renewables estimate is down from 77.8% in our November 2018 report and reflects increased visibility of the industry on our part as well as movements within the industry.”

The correlation between bitcoin mining and renewable energy reportedly makes bitcoin mining “more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.” The report also notes that since November last year, the total hashrate of the network increased from 40 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) to 50 EH/s.

This means that — during this period — the growth of the computing power invested in maintaining the network was slower than its 10-year average but in line with the five-year average.

The report also points out that the temporary decrease in hashrate (of about 40%) registered at the end of last year was the first registered instance in which there has been a major and prolonged decrease in the network’s computing power.

CoinShares believes that the recent increase in bitcoin’s hashrate is caused by old mining hardware being powered on again after the higher price rendered them profitable to run, and the deployment of next-generation, more efficient, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

As Cointelegraph reported in May, Canadian bitcoin mining company Hut 8 made almost $50 million in revenue last year but triggered total losses of almost $140 million. The company’s chief operating officer Andrew Kiguel noted at the time that he believes margins will improve if BTC’s price continues to rise.

Welcome to the bitcoin session! (Laughter in the room). Kidding — welcome to Cryptography and Your Apps session!

This opening quote ended up being the only reference to cryptocurrencies or blockchain throughout the entire presentation of CryptoKit — Apple’s new framework for app developers designed to simplify building security-enhancing cryptographic functionality. Sierra’s joke was likely in recognition of how eagerly the crypto community anticipated the event, as well as the launch of the new toolkit in general.

Despite the heightened expectations that many cryptocurrency enthusiasts harbored, the presentation itself was hardly a ringing announcement of Apple’s newfound openness to blockchain. It turned out to be what it was always meant to be: a hands-on rundown of the new developer tool — with use cases, implementation tips and chunks of code on the slides. Still, what can the crypto industry make of this new release, and does it have anything to do with Apple’s stance on cryptocurrencies?

Great expectations

In the electrified air of the allegedly unfolding blockchain arms race between the world’s major tech powerhouses, cryptocurrency aficionados are hanging on every word these companies say that could be interpreted as endorsement of blockchain technology and its applications. With the 2019 Worldwide Developers Conference underway, vigilant inhabitants of crypto Twitter spotted an unannounced addition to SF Symbols, Apple’s native icon set. Among 1,500 configurable symbols, developers can now leverage four different versions of the bitcoin icon:

Just noticed that Apple's new icon set (SF Symbols), includes bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/Og8dWp2C85 — Brandon (@brandnanthny) June 4, 2019

Needless to say, the move has been interpreted as an instance of mainstream validation, which followed a similar symbol-ic step by Microsoft. And then, crypto media went abuzz over yet another promising development, as it became known that Apple is poised to present a set of cryptographic developer tools.

For a wishful eye, there was little doubt that all the recent tidbits were pieces of the same puzzle: The company is ready to embrace crypto! After years of contentious relationships, marked by two occasions of Coinbase being dropped from App Store and an effective ban on mining on Apple devices, even small steps were seen as welcomed news.

Bullish comments on CryptoKit’s significance for the cryptocurrency space began to surface. Alejandro Machado, co-founder of Open Money Initiative, told The Block that cryptocurrency developers will capitalize on the new feature that CryptoKit offers: the capacity to leverage iPhone’s secure enclave — a hardware pocket disconnected from the processor — to reach the level of security comparable to that of hardware wallets. TrustWallet founder Viktor Radchenko concurred in a widely circulated tweet:

Apple announced CryptoKit for iOS 13, only a few steps away before you can turn your phone into a hardware wallet.https://t.co/21wPSBz0K3 — Viktor Radchenko (@vikmeup) June 4, 2019

Forbes’ Billy Bambrough summarized the enthusiastic vibe by calling CryptoKit’s rollout “Apple's first carefully measured steps into bitcoin and crypto.”

“Duct tape solution”

As it happens, not everyone was immediately ready to hop on the bandwagon. Blockchain developer Ronald Mannak countered the growing bullish sentiment with a series of tweets, deconstructing what CryptoKit is and what it is not. Mannak argued that the new tool is about cryptography, not cryptocurrency, and as such, it has nothing to do with Apple’s stance on crypto and blockchain.

With some improved functionality, CryptoKit is good news for developers but not “the game changer” for the broader crypto space, as compatibility of its affordances with Ethereum and other blockchains remains limited.

Blockchain video blogger Ivan Liljeqvist (Ivan on Tech) projected the same narrative when he spent the first few minutes of his recent stream dwelling on the difference between “cryptography” and “cryptocurrency” and suggesting that “hodlers” should not get overly excited about everything that has “crypto” in it.

He contended that CryptoKit doesn’t look like “how most cryptocurrencies are laid out today,” and it is “not designed for crypto, not having crypto use cases in mind,” citing potential issues with key retrieval and backup from the secure enclave. However, he admitted that one could still build a cryptocurrency on CryptoKit, although it would require a “duct tape solution.”

The basics of what we have

Which of these two perspectives better reflects reality? To answer this question, having a cold-eyed look at CryptoKit and the context of its emergence wouldn’t go amiss.

Apple CryptoKit is a framework that comes with the iOS 13 update. It is built on top of CoreCrypto — Apple’s native cryptographic library. Previously, iOS developers who wished to implement cryptographic operations had to rely on the library called Common Crypto, written in the language Objective-C. As much of the software development on iOS these days occurs in a different language, Swift, this discrepancy proved inconvenient: Unable to use the library directly in Swift, programmers had to spend time on writing wrapper frameworks to make use of it.

CryptoKit, written in Swift, takes care of the issue. It will allow a hassle-free implementation of cryptographic operations such as using public-key cryptography to create and evaluate digital signatures, perform key exchange and use generated symmetric keys to authenticate and encrypt messages. As per Apple’s documentation, the new framework “automatically handles tasks that make your app more secure.”

At the “Cryptography and Your Apps” session, Apple engineers presented major types of prospective use cases: protecting data on a device, protecting credentials and keys, sharing data across devices and users, securing network connections, and verifying remote parties. Sounds like a great privacy-enhancing tool for smartphone users — but where are cryptocurrencies in this picture?

For one, there is potential room for wallet functionality, as many blockchain experts already observed. Sergey Bolshedvorsky, senior iOS developer with Voxpopme, explained:

“The new framework will provide easy-to-use and efficient options for hashing, key generation, key exchange and encryption for developers. All these operations are essential for building cryptocurrency wallets. [...] CryptoKit allows to store private keys in the secure enclave which will hugely increase the protection of these keys and allow for secure public-key cryptography. Current documentation suggests that developers will not have direct access to private keys, therefore these are going to be securely protected and stored on a device.”

At the same time, Bolshedvorsky admits, the tool is not perfectly cut out for cryptocurrency-related applications beyond wallets, yet offers a wide array of uses beyond crypto:

“The current implementation of CryptoKit does not support secp2561k1 curve used by Ethereum and other blockchains, therefore it has a limited applicability for cryptocurrency applications at the moment. Support for these algorithms can be added in future updates, but it is not clear when it will happen. CryptoKit brings easy-to-use cryptography to all applications and it does not limit itself to crypto-related applications.”

Founder and CEO of Zerocracy, the creator of cryptocurrency zold, echoes this idea but points to some of CryptoKit’s less obvious implications for the crypto space. Yegor Bugayenko said:

“Despite the expected market reaction that connected CryptoKit with blockchain and bitcoin, it has nothing to do specifically with those cryptocurrencies. CryptoKit will simplify data encryption and decryption operations, which are used in many other areas, including backups, secure emailing and messages, password generation, and many others. However, natively implemented data encryption algorithms will definitely boost the development of mobile nodes for new lightweight and non-PoW cryptocurrencies, providing millions of iPhone and iPad users with mobile access to microtransactions in the future.”

Industry reaction

Overall, blockchain experts outside of the developer community view CryptoKit’s arrival as welcomed news. While some consider it a manifestation of Apple’s long-anticipated turn toward crypto, others celebrate increased data security and privacy that the new tool is expected to bring about.

Dave Hodgson, director and co-founder of NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investments arm of the NEM blockchain ecosystem, believes that CryptoKit will add to the momentum of mainstream adoption:

""The latest move by Apple is further evidence that blockchain is gaining more mainstream adoption, and it follows a similar release by Samsung and other key players in the space. CryptoKit will allow developers to focus on building a greater user experience without having to divert resources to highly technical areas. An analogy would be GPS on smart phones - allowing Uber to focus on its Consumer app. If you couple CryptoKit with the Apple Sign In announcement, several interesting use cases present themselves and we hope to see other vendors offering similar tools for Android and Windows in due time.""

Matt Branton, chief technology officer of a stablecoin project called Neutral, is largely on board with this optimistic view:

“The increasing interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies among large enterprises signals wider mainstream adoption, in which traditional and emerging industries will continue to overlap. Apple’s plans to unveil the new tool, CryptoKit, which will feature in iOS 13, reveals a promising mission from a traditional tech giant to support growing consumer demand for higher security standards through cryptography. This trend of consumers striving for higher security standards has extended to the digital asset realm, with more and more market participants demanding higher levels of stability and reliability.”

Mateusz Tilewski, co-founder and CTO of blockchain network company Concordium Group, prefers to think of the new cryptographic developer package as a response to the need for higher-quality cryptography in consumer-oriented apps:

“The majority of hacks can be attributed to faulty cryptography design and implementations, so access to quality crypto-utilities is directly correlated to the security of an app. As one of the biggest companies in the world, it is no surprise to see Apple implement proven and stable standards in their kit.""

Overall, while the community’s initial enthusiasm with regard to CryptoKit may be somewhat overblown, in the long run, however, it should further the cryptocurrency movement’s strategic objectives. Although its capacity right now to usher a tidal wave of mobile hard wallets remains controversial, it is upon the developers to test whether it could be an efficient way to move forward. In addition, wider implementation of cryptographic data security solutions means not just better data protection for consumers, but also potential collateral systemic benefits for crypto, including but not limited to the potential rise of mobile-based cryptocurrency nodes.",

Lately, bitcoin vs. gold has been presented as a zero sum game in which only one asset can thrive at the expense of the other. Grayscale Investments, creators of the “Drop gold. Buy bitcoin!” campaign, make it clear where their loyalties lie. “It’s not that gold is bad. It’s just that bitcoin is better,” they venture. This is is a matter of some debate, especially given that bitcoin’s utility as a gold-like store of value is fiercely contested within the cryptocurrency community.

Fortunately, you don’t need to plant your flag in either camp to benefit from exposure to both assets. Whether you believe bitcoin is best suited as a store of value or medium of exchange is immaterial. Likewise, whether you believe gold is a safe haven uncorrelated with global currencies, or a more trusted alternative to bitcoin, backed as it is by thousands of years of reputation, makes little difference. Provided you see value in both, there’s benefits to acquiring both, ideally without needing to convert to fiat along the way.

Renowned stockbroker and libertarian Peter Schiff enables investors to purchase gold and silver using BCH and BTC, via Schiffgold.com, and to take physical delivery of it. Buying precious metals doesn’t have to necessitate assuming custody of course – in fact in most cases it doesn’t. Yield-bearing crypto company Kinesis has initiated an EU and U.K.-wide debit card program with Contis Group, using real assets of gold and silver as the basis for digital currencies, which have a 1:1 allocation with physical bullion, essentially making gold spendable.

Another way of obtaining exposure to gold without ever setting eyes on an ingot is through Currency.com, which enables tokenized commodities to be traded including spot gold, at up to 100X leverage, using BTC or ETH. Like bitcoin, gold can assume many forms for investors, with derivatives, synthetic products, and third party custody taking precedence over non-custodial solutions. There’s the Digix gold token (DGT), for instance, tradable on various cryptocurrency exchanges, each unit of which represents one gram of gold.

Bitcoin and Gold Share Many Similarities

From an investment perspective, you don’t have to ascribe to the Store of Value thesis for bitcoin – or gold – to see it as a worthy long-term hold. One reason why both assets are attractive as part of a well-rounded investment portfolio is because they can increase its Sharpe Ratio. Investing in assets that have low correlation to one another can enhance a portfolio’s risk-adjusted return. While not immune from global economic downturn, bitcoin and gold have shown remarkable resilience to events that have dampened the world’s economy.

The beauty of each asset is that it can be many things to many people, and thus everyone has their own reasons for acquiring gold or bitcoin. Whether you favor gold for its beauty, its scarcity, or its intrinsic value is your prerogative. It’s the same with bitcoin, which can be locked away in a hardware wallet or used to purchase everyday goods and services. If you’ve got the means, you don’t have to drop gold to buy bitcoin or vice-versa – you can have both.

De Mol claims that consumers have lost as much as 1.7 million euros (over $1.9 million) due to the ads, and his reputation was damaged as a result.

It is not the first time the California-based media giant is being sued over fake bitcoin ads — and, despite Facebook’s efforts to eliminate the problem, it seems that the issue persists.

Brief introduction to Facebook’s relationship with crypto ads

In January 2018, Facebook became the first major social media platform to ban cryptocurrency-related ads.

Notably, the social media giant set a precedent for other big tech companies, including Google and Twitter, which soon followed suit and introduced similar regulations on their platforms.

Specifically, Facebook declared at the time that it would prohibit ads that use “misleading or deceptive promotional practices,” referring specifically to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies. Rob Leathern, product management director at Facebook, explained the company’s decision in a blog post:

“We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”

The ban was “intentionally broad,” meaning that the social media company decided to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms (namely Facebook, Instagram and Audience networks) first, and then learn how to select the ones that are actually “deceptive.” However, Leathern also mentioned that the company intended to “revisit this policy and how we enforce it.”

Indeed, in June 2018, Facebook partly reversed the ban, once again allowing cryptocurrency ads on its platform — however, only from preapproved parties this time. The ban on ICOs, however, was kept in full effect. Hence, Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services” policy states:

“Starting June 26, we’ll be updating our policy to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

Further, the updated policy requires advertisers to submit an application beforehand so that Facebook can see if they are fit to run crypto-related ads. Specifically, candidates have been advised to include “any licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange, and other relevant public background on their business.”

Ultimately, Facebook stated that “not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so.”

John De Mol case: Billionaire sues Facebook for damaged reputation

Despite the extra measures from Facebook, it appears that fraud-related crypto ads still manage to find their way to the platform — as a result, the social media giant is now in the midst of a major lawsuit.

The case was filed by John De Mol, a 64 year-old Dutch entertainment mogul whose net worth is estimated to be $1.7 billion.

It is not the first time De Mol, who is affiliated with international TV hits including “The Voice,” ""Deal or No Deal,"" ""Fear Factor"" and ""Big Brother,” has brought up Facebook bitcoin ads that capitalize on his image. He first encountered the problem in October 2018, as Jacqueline Schaap, a lawyer from De Mol’s legal team, told Cointelegraph via email:

“John de Mol noticed the ads for the first time in October 2018, we do not know whether these were the first adds to appear. We just have not noticed them before, but that does not mean that they have not been published.”

At the time, he issued a public statement, saying that none of these ads had been given permission to use his name or image. Specifically, as per De Telegraf’s report, people were asked to transfer money to a company called Bitcoin Profit, which claimed to be backed by De Mol. The ad had reportedly been deleted by the time that article was published.

Now, De Mol is suing Facebook before the Amsterdam District Court, as the problem is still urgent for the media tycoon. According to court documents obtained by Cointelegraph, the ads featuring De Mol’s images promoted cryptocurrency scams on Facebook and Instagram, which allegedly damaged his reputation.

The plaintiff is accusing Facebook of failing to avert the ads and not being able to respond to the complaints on time. Moreover, De Mol’s lawyers asked Facebook to hand over identifying data about the people who create such advertisements.

Further, De Mol’s legal team claims that consumers have lost as much as 1.7 million euros (over $1.9 million) due to the ads, also noting that a number of other Dutch celebrities have been targeted. Schaap told Cointelegraph that the figure was produced from “several newspaper/internet articles” and that it has been mentioned by Fraudedesk, a local organization that raises public awareness about fraudulent activities.

A representative from Fraudedesk confirmed to Cointelegraph that the 1.7 million euros is the amount that has been reported to them by almost 200 people who engaged with the fake ads since 2017. The organization’s spokesperson wrote via email:

“Generally only 10% is reported to us, so this amount is just the tip of the iceberg,”

In a Reuters report, Schaap is quoted as saying that Facebook is responsible for such incidents, and that the current vetting process is not enough: “I don’t know what reality Facebook lives in, but that doesn’t work.”

In response, Facebook lawyer Jens van den Brink reportedly stated that the social media company could not be forced to monitor all ads on its platforms at all times, and that Facebook had removed the De Mol-linked ads promptly after being informed about the complaints.

As per Reuters, when asked by the judge whether Facebook’s vetting includes checking the content of websites that advertisements link to, Van den Brink replied positively, but noted that the company's software can be tricked by advertisers who change links in their ads or disguise the content of those pages. The lawyer also said that Facebook was trying to fix that problem.

Prior to the hearing, Facebook’s Leathern told reporters the company was actively trying to prevent fraudulent ads:

“The people who push these kinds of ads are persistent, they are well-funded and they are constantly evolving their deceptive tactics to get around our systems,”

The outcome of this case is not clear at this point. According to Reuters, the judge mentioned that the two sides might be able to reach a settlement.

Cointelegraph reached out to Van den Brink and Facebook for further comment, but neither of them replied to requests.

De Mol is not the first celebrity to fight fake crypto ads in court

Evidently, De Mol is not the only celebrity who has been targeted by deceptive crypto-related ads on social media. On Twitter, numerous users and bots have been impersonating celebrities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin to promote cryptocurrency giveaways scams.

On Facebook, the fraudsters’ tactic seems different. Instead of promoting giveaways, they mostly appear to describe “big” investment opportunities in nonexistent cryptocurrencies.

To give the appearance of legitimacy, such ads feature fake celebrity endorsement and replicate popular media websites like CNBC or Daily Mail. Ultimately, they trick unknowing users into giving up sensitive data, such as their credit card information. During their research on the matter, the publication The Next Web had detected at least two pages that massively used this strategy, both of which were reportedly registered from Bulgaria.

Although the Dutch entertainment magnate seems to be one of the very few public figures to take the fight over bitcoin ads to court, he is not the first one to do so.

In April 2018, Martin Lewis, a British journalist and TV presenter who created Money Saving Expert, a popular financial advice website, sued Facebook for defamation over fraudulent ads featuring his name. Specifically, he argued that crooks were using his reputation to trick people into bitcoin ""get-rich-quick schemes"" on the social media platform.

""The impact on people’s mental health of losing their retirement funds, or losing their children's money that they thought they were investing is catastrophic and life-destructive,"" he told Business Insider. Lewis also mentioned that he had been contacted by a person who had allegedly lost 19,000 British pounds ($25,000) because of a bitcoin ad featuring his face as well as a woman from Scotland who had been scammed out of 150,000 British pounds ($195,000) in a similar way.

To reach an agreement with Facebook out of court, Lewis requested an apology and a ""manifest substantial change"" in the way the company deals with fake ads, particularly the ones capitalizing on public figures. The TV presenter reportedly said that if he wins the lawsuit, he will donate any damages he is awarded to charity.

In January 2019, Lewis and Facebook came to an agreement after the social media giant announced it was donating 3 million British pounds ($4 million) to Citizens Advice — a United Kingdom-based network of charities — to launch a new project that would educate people about frauds and provide guidance for victims or potential victims.

Moreover, Facebook said it was going to create a new button for its U.K. users that will allow them to report potential scam ads, which would subsequently be reviewed by “a new dedicated team” at Facebook. The company’s regional director for Northern Europe, Steve Hatch, mentioned that if the tools prove to be effective, they could be introduced in more countries.

Lewis said that he was happy with the outcome and preferred it to facing Facebook in court, where he believes he could have won 50,000 to 100,000 British pounds ($63,500-$127,000). He also mentioned that the problem was not limited just to Facebook, since other platforms like Google and Yahoo had similar issues.

It is unclear how Facebook and other big tech companies aim to deal with fraudulent cryptocurrency ads in the future, but for now, the problem persists, dealing damage to common users and stigmatizing the crypto industry.

Lewis, for instance, suggested that Facebook should rely on manual labor because the technology has been failing to sweep away fake ads entirely:

""No one says that a technology company can only have technological solutions. If you can't do it with technology, you know what you have to do, is you have to cut your profits and do it manually,""

However, Facebook might have something else up its sleeve: In April last year, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer, mentioned that the social media giant plans to use facial recognition to help stamp out scam ads, but admitted that it is ""challenging to do technically at scale.""",,https://www.ccn.com/if-bitcoin-hits-this-key-level-its-going-to-make-a-run-for-40k-tom-lee/,"

Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-Founder Tom Lee suggests that if the bitcoin price can capture enough momentum for $10K, it's going for $40K. | Source: Bloomberg/YouTube



By CCN.com: The bitcoin price might have slipped below $8,000 for now, but it could be headed much higher in the near future. Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-Founder Thomas Lee is willing to put it on the line for bitcoin once again, making an aggressive short-term prediction on where the cryptocurrency could be trading if it can capture enough momentum.

In an interview with Binance CFO Wei Zhou, Lee laid out his bullish case. Lee and Zhou agree that once bitcoin regains the $10,000 level, it will be “fast and furious” to $20,000. From there, it’s seemingly to the moon. Once the key FOMO threshold kicks in, historically the price will surge 200% to 400%. Lee stated:

“If bitcoin somehow manages to get to [$10,000], it’s very likely going to make a run to $40,000 within five months.”

Few People Lose Money at Current Bitcoin Levels

When bitcoin finally recaptures $10,000 is anyone’s guess. But in the meantime, BTC $8,000 or thereabouts is not too shabby. Lee points to a bunch of historical stats, saying “it’s at a level that very few people have lost money owning bitcoin here.” The next key threshold could open the floodgates to big investors:

“Every institution is going to realize, look at $10,000 it’s likely to go back to its all-time high, which is double. There are very few things that can double. So I think FOMO truly gets triggered once bitcoin hits $10,000.”

Last year, when the bitcoin price shed more than 80% of its value, it scared many institutional investors away from crypto. Lee suggests it’s understandable considering that if a stock falls roughly that much, its chances of recovering are slim to none. But what they were missing is that bitcoin is in a league of its own.

“At the end of the day, Wall Street – if there’s a known asset class and they believe they can have an edge, they’re going to be quite interested in investing in it…At the right tipping point, and it’s either going to be because of the size of the blockchain or the size of the crypto market itself, Wall Street’s going to suddenly say, ‘Hey look, I don’t care if I understand exactly what’s happening but if I can make a lot of money let’s go ahead and do it.'”

Lee points to the example of credit default swaps as a historical precedent, which started as an Excel spreadsheet and now exceeds cash bond trading.

Binance Maintenance in Response to Disk Failure

Incidentally, at about the time the Binance/Fundstrat interview was posted, Binance users were experiencing issues on the exchange due to what was later described as a “disk failure.”

It’s all systems go on Binance. The bitcoin price, however, remains stuck below $8,000 for the time being though it is most recently paring its losses.",2019-06-08 21:30:36+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/g20-crypto-global-standards/,"G20 Starts Crypto Discussions - A Look at Global Standards

Finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 countries have gathered this weekend for a two-day meeting ahead of the G20 summit, and cryptocurrency is among the topics of discussion. Global standard-setting bodies have submitted their policies and provided tools to help the member countries with the regulation of crypto assets in their own jurisdictions.

Crypto Discussions at G20 Meeting

World leaders will gather in Osaka as Japan hosts its first ever G20 summit on June 28 and 29. Ahead of the summit is a G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting which is taking place on June 8 and 9 in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Besides the G20 countries, there are invited guest countries and international organizations that will be participating including the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. Cryptocurrency, regulations, and how users should be protected in the new financial system are being discussed at the conference this weekend, according to local media.

Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), mentioned crypto assets in her speech at the meeting on Saturday afternoon. She believes that “harmonization of different approaches from country to country, such as dealing with crypto assets and non-bank financial intermediaries, is important, but it also needs to aim for financial stability and consumer protection,” Nikkei conveyed. The IMF chief was further quoted as saying:

It is important to continue international dialogue, but it is not as easy as it looks.

At the G20 High-Level Seminar on Financial Innovation Saturday afternoon, Blockstream CEO Adam Back explained the differences between crypto assets, blockchains and the current financial infrastructure, local media reported. After talking about secure tokenization and using blockchain for remittances, he noted the importance of fiat currencies being issued on a blockchain and explained his aim to provide OTC traders and institutional investors with a way to swap stablecoins and bitcoins linked to the Japanese yen. A potential scenario, according to him, is where the public can purchase and store a digitalized version of the yen in a hardware wallet that is managed offline without being exposed to online attacks.

Outlining the G20 role and priorities under the Japanese presidency, Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso remarked, “We will also take steps to harness the potential benefits of technological innovation, such as distributed ledger technology, while mitigating its risks, including those posed by crypto-assets.”

Global Crypto Regulatory Standards

A number of global organizations have been working on regulatory standards for crypto assets which the G20 countries can apply in their own jurisdictions. They include the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Committee for Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Each covers different aspects of crypto asset risks within their respective mandates. The FSB elaborated:

Standard-setting bodies and other international organisations are working on a number of fronts, directly addressing issues arising from crypto-assets. They are mainly focused on investor protection, market integrity, anti-money laundering, bank exposures and financial stability monitoring.

The FSB is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. It has submitted several crypto-related reports to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting. The most recent one, entitled “Decentralised financial technologies,” was published on June 6. It follows another which details standard-setting organizations’ regulatory approaches and work underway on crypto assets. The board has also submitted a report which lists all member countries’ crypto asset regulators to help them collaborate on regulations.

Crypto Exchange Registry

Among crypto-related topics to be discussed, finance ministers and central bankers from the G20 countries are expected to reach an agreement on creating a registry of crypto exchanges in an effort “to prevent virtual money laundering,” Nikkei Asian Review reported.

Japan is expected to lead the discussion, drawing from its own experience of requiring all crypto exchange operators in the country to register with its top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency. So far, 19 exchange operators have successfully registered. They have to comply with strict rules imposed after one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, Coincheck, was hacked in January last year. In September, a registered exchange, Zaif, was also hacked.

The tightened regulation has discouraged a number of operators from registering; some voluntarily withdrew their applications while others were rejected by the agency. Nonetheless, the regulator revealed to news.Bitcoin.com in March that over 140 more businesses had expressed interest in registration.

Financial Stability

The FSB continually assesses financial stability risks from crypto assets and reports to the G20. In March last year, the board reported that crypto assets did not pose material risks to global financial stability. In its report entitled “Crypto-assets: Work underway, regulatory approaches and potential gaps,” the board reaffirmed:

To date, the FSB continues to assess that crypto-assets do not pose material risks to global financial stability at present, but that they do raise a number of further policy issues beyond financial stability.

The European Central Bank shares the sentiment. In its May report, the bank stated that “At present, crypto-assets’ implications for and/or risks to the financial stability of the euro area, monetary policy, and payments and market infrastructures are limited or manageable.”

Another FSB report will be released in September which will include developments in stablecoins and tokenization. According to the FSB, the OECD is also “currently undertaking analytical work on tokenisation of assets and the impact a possible proliferation of such a mechanism would have on the financial markets, as well as around the benefits and risks of stablecoins.”

Guidance on Virtual Currencies

The G20 countries have already reaffirmed their support for the FATF as the global standard-setting body in areas of combating money laundering and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. They have also agreed to follow the FATF recommendations including those concerning crypto assets.

The FATF has promised to release its new “Guidance on Virtual Currencies” this month. A number of countries such as Japan, Russia and South Korea, have already begun complying with the crypto standards created by the FATF, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.

Different Regulatory Approaches and Gaps

The FSB explains that regulatory gaps may arise when crypto assets are “outside the perimeter of market regulators and payment system oversight” and “from the absence of international standards or recommendations.” Noting as examples “issues around crypto-asset wallets as specific vehicles for storing crypto assets,” the board asserted that “The rapid technological evolution of crypto-asset markets may also influence regulatory approaches and give rise to regulatory gaps or areas that require more regulatory focus,” adding:

A forward-looking approach in monitoring crypto assets can help provide a basis for identifying potential gaps and areas that should be prioritised or focused on.

The board, therefore, “recommends that the G20 keep the topic of regulatory approaches and potential gaps, including the question of whether more coordination is needed, under review.”

Banks Engaging in Crypto Activities

The BCBS is assessing and responding to the risk crypto assets pose to the banking system. It has been monitoring crypto-related developments and is “developing high-level supervisory expectations for banks engaging in crypto-asset activities.” Currently, the Basel framework does not explicitly apply to banks with exposures to crypto assets but “it does set out minimum requirements for the capital and liquidity treatment of ‘other assets,'” the FSB clarifies:

The committee is now considering whether to formally clarify the prudential treatment of crypto-assets across the set of risk categories.

Central Bank Digital Currencies

A study on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has been conducted by the CPMI whose work on crypto assets focuses on innovations in payments, clearing and settlement, and their impact on the current standards for financial market infrastructures.

While most central banks are interested, the study has found that they “appear to have identified the challenges of launching a CBDC, but are not yet convinced that the benefits (mainly of enhanced payments safety and efficiency) will outweigh the costs,” the FSB details:

The CPMI’s future work includes advising central banks to proceed with caution on CBDCs.

The committee will also continue to monitor “CBDCs and private digital tokens used for payments,” exchange information and analysis with regulators and global policymakers, as well as explore “potential legal issues relating to digital currencies.”

Investment Funds and Crypto Trading Platforms

The regulation of crypto trading platforms and investment funds with exposures to crypto assets are currently the focus of the IOSCO, the global standard setter for securities market regulation. A final report by the commission is expected by the end of the year. The FSB described:

IOSCO’s policy committee addressing enforcement issues has also created a portal through which its members can access and share information on enforcement and other issues relevant to crypto-assets and other digital threats.

The organization has also been focusing on initial coin offerings (ICOs). Having established an ICO Consultation Network for members to discuss their experiences and concerns, it will also develop an ICO Support Framework to assist members in dealing with the regulatory risks from token sales in their jurisdictions. Last week, the organization published a consultation paper entitled “Issues, risks and regulatory considerations relating to crypto-asset trading platforms” and has requested feedback on key considerations by July 29.

Ever wanted to trade like a bitcoin whale? Here are the secrets. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com: The crypto newswire went berserk after a research firm published a blockbuster report revealing deep-pocketed “whales” had jumped into the BTC market at the end of 2018 to take advantage of the bitcoin price dump. At that time, bitcoin had fallen 85 percent from its high.

The whales knew precisely what they were doing. They are the smart money, and you don’t want to be the dumb money.

So how can you trade bitcoin like a whale?

There are two secrets.

Secret #1: Use This Simple Trick From a Bitcoin Chart

Whenever you look at a chart of a security, you’ll find something called Bollinger Bands that can be overlaid onto the prices.

Bollinger Bands are simply data points that are placed one standard deviation above and below each day’s closing price.

As those data points line up next to each other, they form two jiggly lines on either side of the price chart that look like bands.

Bollinger Bands act as short-term buy and sell signals. Should the security’s price, which in this case is BTC, hit either band, then there is a strong probability that the price of the security will soon switch direction.

It doesn’t necessarily mean the security has hit a bottom or top, but that a bottom or top is likely to occur in the near future.

Bollinger Bands Are the Secret Sauce

Let’s look at a two-year chart of the NYSE Bitcoin Index, with Bollinger Bands overlaid.

As you can see, the signal has been pretty reliable.

Now let’s zoom in on the end of 2018.

As bitcoin crashed, you can see the price actually edged outside the lower Bollinger Band. With BTC falling that precipitously, it was a tip-off for the crypto market whales to pay attention.

Once the price shifted back inside the band, it suggested the worst of the decline was over and that it was time to buy in at around $3,800.

Again, indicators like these are windsocks and not crystal balls, so BTC still fell another $500, but I suspect bitcoin whales just kept buying.

I’m also willing to bet that once the big rise in May hit the upper Bollinger Band, broke through, and shifted back in, that bitcoin whales started selling.

They made big money.

Secret #2: Buy When There’s Blood in the Streets

I personally won’t touch bitcoin because of the volatility. However, the famous 18th-century nobleman Baron Rothschild said, “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” That’s how one can make outsized investment returns, as long as he’s willing to stomach the risk.

An 85 percent decline in BTC prices definitely is a case of blood in the streets.

That was the other signal to the bitcoin whales. Between the Bollinger Band indicator and the huge decline, speculative bitcoin whales bought in at the right time.

Next time, you might also just tread carefully. Bitcoin is not a wise place to put your money.",2019-06-08 13:00:57+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lessons-from-the-rise-and-fall-of-crypto-currencies-bitcoin-2017-asset-classes-doubled-1.5167468,"Remember bitcoin? It was a hot topic in late 2017, but when its value plummeted, most people forgot about it. You might be surprised to hear that — so far in 2019 — crypto currencies have quietly become one of the best performing asset classes in 2019. Bitcoin's value has more than doubled.

The purpose of this article is not to discuss whether bitcoin is a good investment, but rather to see what can be learned from bitcoin's meteoric rise, crash and bounce.

Successful investors keep a level head. The more passionate you are about an investment, the more biased you become. Many bad decisions are made purely by emotion and this is particularly true when investing in a high-risk sector like cryptocurrencies, marijuana or the initial offering of a favourite tech company.

""I decided to sell all but one of my bitcoins after I was cornered at my daughter's hockey game by a group of grandparents who wanted me to teach them how to trade crypto,"" says Ting (Sarah Rieger/CBC)

Avoid confirmation bias whereby we seek others who will reinforce our own views, whether it be through visiting websites, watching videos or talking to like-minded investors. You need to make a concerted effort to seek opinions that differ from your own. Listening to opposing viewpoints will help keep emotions in check. It reduces the likelihood that you will become overconfident in your investment prowess and do something foolish like betting everything you have on one investment.

There is an investment adage which suggests that when people you least expect (teenagers, taxi drivers or soccer moms) start to talk about a particular investment, it's time to sell. Looking back at the height of the crypto frenzy, that's exactly what happened. Bitcoin was front page news, it was trending on Google, YouTube and other social media platforms, and people from all walks of life were fascinated by its potential. Although few, I suspect, really understood the technology behind the new ""currency.""

That was my sign to sell which I did for just under $13,000 US a coin. I sold early as the price peaked at $20,000 US a week later before dropping to $3,000 US in late 2018.

It's currently hovering around $8,000 US.

When bitcoin bottomed out there was no fanfare, no media coverage — nobody cared. By then many of the people who bought near the top capitulated and sold their position (classic buy high and sell low behaviour). The ""whales,"" those who owned a large amount of bitcoin, started buying again. I expect this unproven sector to continue to be very volatile for years, but now that prices have come down I'm considering dipping my toe back into the crypto waters.

Here are the rules I follow when making speculative investments:

I'm a contrarian. I prefer to sell when most are buying, and buy when they are selling. If an investment is in the spotlight, I'm very cautious.

If things go well and I double my money, I take back my principal but keep the profits invested. A common mistake is to lock in profits but then re-invest into something just as risky — for example, selling crypto and then buying a startup marijuana stock. This is poor risk management.

Keep the bulk of your assets in low- and medium-risk investments. Diversification is the key to long-term investing success. Only wager an insignificant amount in a highly speculative investment — you must be okay losing most, if not all, of your principal if this investment doesn't do well.

The exchange revealed the news in a post on its blog on June 7.

Per the announcement, after June 21, U.S. traders won’t be able to access a slew of coins listed on the exchange, including QTUM and STORJ.

The exchange noted that U.S. users will receive an email with explanations concerning what they are and are not allowed to do with the aforementioned assets. The options cited by the exchange include selling them for assets that will stay available to them, canceling orders and moving them off the exchange.

After the change comes into effect, U.S. customers won’t be able to buy or sell the select coins, while all open orders involving said assets will be canceled. Some limited functionality concerning the assets will still be available to U.S. traders and the coins will be transitioned to the Bittrex International platform:

“U.S. Customers may withdraw or continue to hold in their Bittrex wallet affected Tokens/Coins for as long as Bittrex International supports a market in those Tokens/Coins.“

Bittrex International is Bittrex’s Europe-based affiliate, which lists certain tokens that are only available on the Bittrex International platform — not to U.S. users.

As Cointelegraph reported in mid-March, Bittrex canceled its first Initial Exchange Offering, which it had been planning to host on Bittrex International.

As reported last week, the decentralized exchange developed by top cryptocurrency exchange Binance will block website access to users based in 29 countries, including the U.S.

As Cointelegraph reported this week, bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently hit a high of 263,000 BTC on May 12, a volume that has not been seen since February 4, 2018.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-satoshi-the-smallest-unit-on-the-bitcoin-blockchains,"From paying for pizza with satoshi (SAT) on the Lightning Network to the 10,000 satoshis being added to the Lightning Torch each time it is passed, down to the 1 sat/byte rate on the bitcoin SV network, SAT is being used more and more in blockchain and crypto conversations.

The satoshi is the smallest unit that is recorded on the bitcoin blockchains: One satoshi represents a decimal, seven zeros and a 1, followed by any of the bitcoin tickers — i.e., bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin SV (BSV) or bitcoin cash (BCH). In other words, 0.00000001 or 1.0 * 10-8, in scientific notation.

SAT is becoming more common in day-to-day blockchain and cryptocurrency conversations. Bitcoin mining software like HoneyMiner pay your mining reward in SAT, #StackingSats is a hashtag used frequently on Twitter, and the Lightning Torch was accounted for in satoshis — just to name a few instances of the word being used.

But many — especially those who are new to blockchain and cryptocurrency — may be seeing these current events that involve the SAT and asking themselves “What is a satoshi!?”

What is satoshi, and who created satoshi?

When we say “satoshi,” we actually are not referring to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. However, the satoshi we refer to similarly goes back to the early days of bitcoin and the BitcoinTalk forum.

It all began on Nov. 15, 2010, when BitcoinTalk user Ribuck proposed that 1/100 of a bitcoin (0.01 BTC) — the smallest unit that could be displayed on the interface, at the time — be called a satoshi. Although Ribuck made this proposal, none of the other users on the BitcoinTalk forum affirmed or denied his proposal. This may have been because the thread at hand was a poll where voting took place regarding the best Unicode character for bitcoin, which has nothing to do with units of account and, therefore, may have made Ribuck’s comment look out of place.

However, when Ribuck joined in on Unicode thread, he entered with a question:

“What's the plan for subdividing Bitcoins? Do we go in thousands like the metric system (millibits, microbits, nanobits)?”

It was a good question, but a question that nobody was willing to answer, confirm or deny. As a result, the idea expired, and there was no action taken regarding Ribuck’s proposal — at least, not at first.

Three months later, on Feb. 10, 2011, Ribuck made a similar comment regarding the unit of account denominations. But this time around, Ribuck’s comment felt more at home in a thread titled, “More divisibility required — move the decimal point.” This time, when Ribuck joined the discussion, he got feedback — eight days later, in an entirely new thread titled Bitcent, in which BitcoinTalk user Kolbas decided it was time to think about smaller monetary units recorded on bitcoin’s blockchain.

On the Bitcent thread, a user commented reinstating Ribuck’s initial proposal, the user said:

“1 satoshi = 1 microbitcent (smallest denomination) 100 million satoshis = 1 bitcoin Are we agreed?”

To which, another user replied, “affirmative.” And after that, it was all said and done: 0.00000001, the smallest unit that could be recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, became known as a satoshi from that moment forward.

Why the time lag?

Although satoshi entered the blockchain and crypto industry lexicon in 2011, it did not become popular — maybe even a buzzword — until recently. As of late, more and more people refer to SAT, mention SAT in their podcasts, have campaigns that revolve around SAT — for example, #StackingSats — or price goods and services in SAT.

Chris Mezzacappa, CEO of bitConsult, a bitcoin consulting company, said this may be because of price bias:

“Coming from a finance background, I automatically think of stock prices and stock splits. [...] Ultimately, people want more of something and have price bias.”

If a stock has a relatively high value, the company may decide to split the stock so that the individual shares become more affordable — and easier on the mind — for retail investors. The same psychology applies to bitcoin having a high price tag, which is why cheaper altcoins typically could look more attractive and affordable to first-time buyers when they enter cryptocurrency markets (think Ripple or even Ethereum).

Mezzacappa continued:

“There's been focus in the past on ""moving the decimal"" because of this. However, even with price bias aside, it does feel ridiculous buying something online with .001 BTC. I'm not sure sats will be the final answer — it's too hard to remember how many decimal places bitcoin has. However, if the whole industry switches to sats, it may become second nature.”

As consumers, we are used to buying goods and services that have user-friendly price tags — whole numbers, or numbers that are rounded off at the end. But because of bitcoin’s relatively high price compared to the price of many day-to-day goods and services, when items are priced in BTC, they usually end up with relatively unattractive numbers — for example, $5 is 0.00057206 BTC, at the time of writing. However, SAT was able to change that and gave consumers a user-friendly number to work with — for example, $5 is equal to 57,206 satoshi, at the time of writing, which is not the prettiest, but cleaner than 0.00057206.

Jesse Xiong, a JPMorgan Chase Quorum Ambassador, has similar beliefs as Mezzacappa. Xiong believes that SAT has become more popular because, simply put, “decimals scare people.”

Most people aren’t fond of working with fractions and decimals. If things were priced solely in BTC, it could leave merchants with unattractive price tags that are likely to confuse consumers at the checkout.

That being said, you should familiarize yourself with SAT — because it could be here to stay, at least for the short term. After eight long years, satoshi has gained popularity. Satoshi has created a more convenient way to price goods and services in BTC — without the price tag looking unattractive or confusing to consumers. Both price and price bias seem to contribute to the time lag regarding SAT gaining popularity, but all in all, the industry appears to have made SAT a meme in and of itself, finding their own unique ways to incorporate satoshi into our lives — like the lightning torch — and doing so in such a way that these events that it is involved in have caught fire and gone viral in their own respects, bringing satoshi along for the ride with it.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-debit-cards-you-can-use-now-plus-a-few-to-expect-soon/,"Crypto Debit Cards You Can Use Now Plus a Few to Expect Soon

Debit cards tied to cryptocurrency wallets provide an opportunity to spend your digital coins almost anywhere fiat money is accepted. It’s a working solution, at least until wider adoption comes around. That’s why they’ve become so popular in the crypto community. Challenges of different sorts have negatively affected some of the earlier offerings, but it’s good to see products that have survived and new ones that are gaining traction or are about to enter the market.

A Global Crypto Debit Card

During the past year, crypto winter forced businesses to downsize and adjust to unfavorable market and regulatory conditions. Many are still trying to adapt and some are already seeking opportunities elsewhere. For example, the company that issued Shift, arguably the first bitcoin debit card in the U.S. which allowed holders to spend from their Coinbase wallet, is not offering it anymore. It’s now operating under a new brand name, Apto Payments. And in Europe, many card providers suffered a hard blow when Visa terminated Wavecrest’s membership – some have recovered, others are yet to return.

Not everything is so bleak, however. Paycent is a crypto debit card that’s been available worldwide since relatively recently but according to its website, over 53,000 cards have already been delivered globally. They enable users of the Paycent wallet to spend their digital assets in brick and mortar stores as well as with online merchants through conversion to fiat. You can also withdraw funds in local currency from ATMs in just about any country. The card can be ordered from the platform’s wallet which supports a number of coins including bitcoin core, ethereum, litecoin, dash, and the Binance token.

Paycent’s operator, Singapore-based company Texcent Asia, issues three types of cards – Mastercard, Union Pay International and China Union Pay. The Ruby card (CUP) has spending and withdrawal limits of $2,500, while the Sapphire card (UPI) and the Solitaire card (MC) are limited to $5,600 for transactions and $1,650 for withdrawals. They come as both physical and virtual cards and are delivered for $49. You can find out more about the applicable fees and limits on the Paycent card site.

At the moment, Paycent is offering one of the few, if not the only, crypto debit cards with global coverage. Nevertheless, there’s a number of other options that we’ve previously reviewed and here are those that are still available in mid-2019. Wirex is a popular choice in Europe. Its Visa card supports conversion from several major cryptocurrencies and provides a 0.5% BTC cashback on in-store purchases. The card issued by Bitpay remains a working option for U.S. residents who can use it to shop with Visa merchants anywhere in the world. They can spend bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) from their Bitpay wallet and the cryptos are converted to dollars.

Cryptopay is a platform that offers a prepaid card which can be loaded from its wallet supporting four cryptocurrencies – bitcoin core, ethereum, litecoin, and ripple. The card is currently available for clients in the U.K., Europe and Russia, with negotiations underway with a new issuer in Singapore. It comes in plastic and virtual form and allows holders to spend their coins both online and offline as well as withdraw fiat cash worldwide.

Cards Supporting Bitcoin Cash

A growing number of card issuers now support bitcoin cash in their products, with the above-mentioned Bitpay being the most notable example. Other platforms added the cryptocurrency more recently. Crypto.com’s MCO Visa card has allowed you to spend BCH since the end of May, when the Hong Kong-based payment processor announced it had introduced the coin to its wallet and card app. The company started shipping its debit cards to customers in Singapore last October and promised to take them to the U.S. through a partnership between its Florida-registered affiliate Foris Inc. and the Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York. Its wallet is currently available in 36 states but there’s been no update on the plans for the card itself.

Crypto enthusiasts who have a Uquid account can order one of their virtual and plastic cards. The platform promises unlimited online spending and ATM withdrawals as well as fee-free POS purchases. You can top up your balance with a staggering number of coins and tokens, a total of 89 so far, including bitcoin cash. Your digital assets can be converted to British pounds, euros and U.S. dollars. The card is not offered in the United States, however, and you’ll be able to determine if your country is eligible only after logging in to your account. Creating one is free of charge but ordering the physical card will cost you up to $17, depending on the fiat currency you’ve chosen.

Bitnovo buys and sells more than 20 major cryptocurrencies. The trading platform has a mobile app and issues debit cards with which you can pay in stores and online with coins converted to euros. To use it you don’t need to have an associated bank account and you can top up with crypto. Bitnovo added BCH to its options in September last year. It also supports bitcoin core, dash, litecoin, ripple, zcash and stellar. Bitcard allows you to withdraw fiat from ATMs for €1 per transaction and there’s a monthly fee of €1.20. The card is currently available only for EU residents. Ordering a Basic Level card does not require any registration but you can only load up to €250 on it. The Level Plus (up to €2,500 per year) and the Premium Level cards (maximum €15,000) do come with the obligation to share personal data.

An offering known from before the Wavecrest saga is now returning to the market. Belize-based company Advcash is preparing to launch its virtual and plastic cards in the European Union, Russia and other countries. The fiat currency of the ADV Cards will be either euro or U.S. dollar but holders will be able to withdraw any currency at teller machines around the globe. You’ll be able to fund your card with the ADV wallet which supports BCH along with other leading cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, LTC, HRP, and ZEC. Advcash promises free shipping for their cards and no maintenance fees but you need to pay 14.99 in euros or dollars for the card. Detailed information about other fees and limits can be found on the issuer’s website.

A new player in the niche is the Spanish fintech startup 2gether, which is targeting its products and services at the crypto community in Europe. The platform released its prepaid Visa card in April and its holders can use it in any of the 19 members of the Eurozone with plans to expand availability to the rest of the EU. It allows you to spend your digital coins anywhere Visa is accepted through instant conversion to EUR, which is the common fiat currency of the Eurozone countries. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is one of seven supported cryptocurrencies along with ETH, BTC, XPR, EOS, XLM, and LTC. 2gether lets you hold and manage euro and crypto balances in the same app as well as to buy and sell digital coins.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

Advances in cryptography are converging to help developers bring blockchain applications closer to the core decentralizing principles on which this technology is founded.

Inventions such as atomic swaps, zk-SNARKS and Lightning-based smart contracts are allowing developers to realize the dream of true peer-to-peer transactions in which neither party, nor an outside intermediary, can act maliciously. Witness the rising number of non-custodial and decentralized exchange (DEX) services for trading crypto assets.

This is exciting. But it also shines a light on another big problem that has curtailed the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology: secure key management.

For too long, the most reliable means of protecting the private keys that afford the holder control over an underlying crypto asset have been too clunky, insufficiently versatile, or difficult to implement on scale. User experience has been sacrificed in return for security.

Now, some big strides in another hugely important field of cryptography – secure multiparty computation, or MPC – point to a potential Holy Grail situation of both usability and security in a decentralized system.

A keyless wallet

Progress in this field was marked last week by Tel Aviv-based KZen’s public announcement of the specs for its new ZenGo wallet. ZenGo uses MPC, along with other sophisticated cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and threshold cryptography, to share signing responsibility for a particular cryptocurrency address among a group of otherwise non-trusting entities.

The beauty of the KZen model is that security is no longer a function of one or more entities maintaining total control over a distinct private key of their own – the core point of vulnerability in cryptocurrency management until now. Instead the key is collectively derived from individual fragments which are separately generated by multiple, non-trusting computers.

The model draws on the genius of MPC cryptography.

With this approach, multiple non-trusting computers can each conduct computation on their own unique fragments of a larger data set to collectively produce a desired common outcome without any one node knowing the details of the others’ fragments.

The private key that executes the transaction is thus a collectively generated value; at no point is a single, vulnerable computer responsible for an actual key. (KZen’s site includes a useful explainer on how it all works.)

KZen is not the only provider of MPC solutions for blockchain key management. Unbound, another Israeli company, is going after the enterprise marketplace with its MPC solutions for crypto security.

Unbound’s prolific (if blatantly pro-MPC) blog offers different angles on the same argument.

It makes a repeated case for why MPC is superior to the two preferred approaches to crypto security of the moment: hardware security modules (HSM), on which hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor are built, and multi-signature (multisig) technologies, which are favored by exchanges.

Attacking the trade-offs

If KZen and Unbound are to be believed, MPC solutions resolve both the hot-versus-cold trade-off in key management and the dilemma of self-versus-managed custody.

Cold wallets, in which keys are stored in an entirely offline environment out of attackers’ reach, are quite secure so long as they remain in that offline state. (Though you really don’t want to lose that piece of paper on which you printed out your private key.)

But bringing them into a transactable, online environment poses an overly cumbersome challenge when you want to use those keys to send money. That’s perhaps not a problem if you’re just a HODLer who transacts rarely but it’s a serious limitation to blockchain technology’s prospects for transforming overall global commerce.

On the other hand, hot wallets have, until now, been notoriously vulnerable.

Whether it’s the relentless “SIM jack” attacks on people’s phones that are emptying out both hosted (third-party custodial) wallets and on-phone self-custody holdings, retail participants’ horror stories are legion. And, of course, we all know the stories of custodial exchanges being hacked – from Japan, to Hong Kong, to Canada, to Malta.

At the same time, the solution that regulated institutional investors are currently seeking – that custodians and exchanges build Fort Knox-like “military-grade” custody solutions – inherently contain a compromise.

Not only does this approach fail to resolve the dependence on a third-party, but there are serious doubts about whether any such solution can be forever safe from hackers, who are constantly improving their methods for getting over firewalls. In best-case scenarios, the constant IT upgrades becomes a massive money suck.

Alternative to HSMs and multisig

None of this is not to say that existing security technologies are useless.

Ledger and Trezor’s hardware devices – a more nimble form of cold wallet – are widely used by individuals who are uncomfortable with both external third-party custody and online, on-device self-custody wallets. And, separately, multi-signature (multisig) solutions, in which an m-of-n quorum of keys are required to execute a transaction, have proven robust enough to be used by most exchanges.

But in both cases, vulnerabilities have been exposed. And to a large extent those risks come down to the fact that, regardless of the surrounding security model’s sophistication, the all-important keys are always sitting at single points of failure.

Just last week, researchers demonstrated how they could hack into a remote hardware security module. The irony: the researchers were from Ledger, which relies on HSM to secure its customers’ keys.

Multisig models arguably offer protections across such attacks, because a breach requires simultaneous control of more than one key held in separate locations, but the fact is that multisig solutions have also failed because of both technical and human vulnerabilities (inside jobs).

What’s more, both solutions are inherently limited by the need to customize them to particular specifications or ledgers. Crypto developer Christopher Allen pointed out last week , for example, that HSMs are particularly constrained by the fact that they are defined by government standards.

And in each case, the ledger-specific design of the underlying cryptography means there is no support for the kind of multi-asset wallets that will be needed in a decentralized interoperable world of cross-chain transactions.

By contrast, KZen is boasting that its key-less wallet will be a multi-ledger application from day one.

Challenges and opportunities

To be sure, MPC remains unproven in a practical sense.

For some time, the heavy resources needed to carry out these network computing functions made it a challenging, costly concept to bring into real-world environments. But rapid technical improvements in recent years have made this sophisticated technology a viable option for all kinds of distributed computing environments where trust is an issue.

And key management isn’t its only application for blockchains, either. MPC technology plays a vital role in MIT-founded startup Enigma’s work on “secret contracts” as part of its sweeping plan to build the “privacy layer for the decentralized web.”

(An aside: Enigma CEO and founder, Guy Zyskind, is also an Israeli. Israel has fostered a remarkable concentration of cryptographic expertise in this space.)

It would be unwise to assume that MPC, or any technology for that matter, will provide a perfect, totally infallible solution to security problems. It is always true that the biggest security threats come when human beings complacently believe security is not a threat.

However, if you squint hard enough, and think about how this technology’s prospects for better key management can be married to Enigma’s vision for an MPC-based secret contract layer and to the broader march toward decentralized, interoperable asset exchanges, a compelling vision of true peer-to-peer blockchain-based commerce starts to emerge.

At the very least, you need to watch this space.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

For the past few days, cryptocurrencies have managed to hold onto a large part of their gains. This is a positive sign, as it shows that the bulls are not in a hurry to book profits. It is also comforting to see that the gains have come on the back of increasing volumes. Bitcoin’s (BTC) trading volume on Coinbase recently hit its highest level since Feb. 4 of last year, which shows that the price is rising higher backed by strong demand.

However, the positive sentiment supported by improving fundamentals has led to a number of analysts projecting a vertical rally in bitcoin, similar to the one seen in 2017. Some of the targets currently talked about are $25,000 and $40,000, both within a short span of time. While anything is possible in the crypto markets, we believe that these calls are a little more aggressive. The current rally is likely to face a number of bumps en route to new highs and will test the patience of the bulls. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for dips to buy instead of chasing the price higher.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) was the best performer among the top 20 major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The platform surged to second position on Github with 4,245 events in the past 30 days, ending June 4, which is a positive sign. What does the chart project?

Due to a short trading history, we shall use the daily chart for analysis. The ATOM/USD pair has been consolidating roughly between $5.660 and $6.603. Attempts to breakout of this range failed on June 3 and 4, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the dips to $5.660 were purchased on June 5 and 6, which shows buyers willing to get in at support.

Consolidation near the highs is a positive sign: it is usually followed by a breakout and continuation of the upward move.

A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $6.603 will resume the uptrend that can carry the price to $7.905. If this level is crossed, the upwards move can extend to $8.794. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair plummets below the 20-week EMA, and the next lower support is at $4.8.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) is the second-best performer of the past seven days. The upcoming halvening is acting as a bullish factor that has kept the price close to its recent highs. Traders anticipate that reduced supply will result in higher prices. The litecoin hashrate has also been making new highs consistently, which is a positive sign. Can the price continue higher or has it hit a hurdle?

The LTC/USD pair is facing selling at the resistance line of the ascending channel. However, the attempts by the bears to sink it have been unsuccessful. Buyers have been stepping in close to $100 and pushing the price right back up, which is a positive sign.

If the bulls push the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel, the pair will rally to $158.91. This is the target objective following the breakout from the cup and handle pattern. Above this, we anticipate a move to $184.7940, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.

If, however, the cryptocurrency fails to break out of the channel, the bears will again try to sink it below the breakout level of $91. A breakdown of this and the support line of the channel will indicate a change in trend.

BSV/USD

This is the third successive week that bitcoin sv (BSV) has been among the top five performers. The surge in price following the news about Craig Wright’s filing for copyright claims on the bitcoin white paper has held up quite well. What is in store in the next few weeks? Can the uptrend resume or will it dump? Let us analyze the chart.

The BSV/USD pair has formed an inside week candlestick pattern and is finding support close to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally, while it is facing resistance near the high of $254. This points to a consolidation in the next few weeks, and a range formation after such a sharp move is a positive sign. After the boundaries of the range are defined, traders can buy closer to the support and sell near the resistance. Currently, we do not find any reliable pattern that offers a good risk to reward ratio.

The uptrend will weaken if the pair breaks down of $176.083 and drops to $152.015, which is a 50% retracement level of the recent upwards move. If this level also breaks, the trend will turn down. Conversely, a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $254 will resume the uptrend and launch the cryptocurrency to $307.789 and above it to $340.248.

BNB/USD

The website for the Binance decentralized exchange (DEX) plans to block users in 29 countries from accessing the DEX. The exchange has also released its official Trust Wallet for the Binance DEX users, and also plans to issue its own stablecoin within the next two months, which will be 100% pegged to the British pound and will be called “Binance GBP.” Subsequently, the exchange plans to release stablecoins backed by other currencies, barring the U.S. dollar. In other Binance news, a former executive at Dell and the NBA will join Binance as theIR new official strategy officer. Backed by fundamental news, can binance coin (BNB) extend its upwards move or is the rally tiring out? Let’s analyze.

In a strong uptrend, the pullbacks are shallow and the price quickly bounces off strong supports because traders jump in to buy on any dip. Backed by momentum, the price quickly rallies to make a new high. The BNB/USD pair has been making a series of new highs after breaking out of the previous high of $26.4732350 in mid-May, which confirms that the pair is in a new uptrend. The first target to watch is $40, followed by a rally to $46.1645899. If the momentum picks up, the upwards move can even extend to $56.0786952.

On the contrary, if the bulls struggle to propel the price above the resistance line, a few weeks of consolidation is possible. The trend will turn negative only after the higher highs and higher lows sequence is violated. Until then, the uptrend remains in force.

XRP/USD

Ripple, the company behind crypto asset XRP, has said that it will take a more conservative approach in reporting XRP sales this quarter. This is being done to allay the fears among institutions and consumers on fake reporting of trading volume in the crypto markets. Thailand’s largest commercial bank, Siam Commercial Bank, has denied that it plans to use Ripple’s XRP token, just days after a tweet that hinted the bank’s plans to do so. Also this week, hackers stole about $10 million worth of XRP from nearly 100 XRP ledger wallets on wallet service GateHub.

The XRP/USD pair has formed a flag following the rise from the lows. A breakout of the flag will point to a resumption of the up move that can carry the price to $0.66413 and above it to $0.76440.

Conversely, a breakdown of the flag will be a negative sign, as it shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair has support at $0.37835 and below it at $0.355660. The 50-week SMA and 20-week EMA are also close to these horizontal supports. Therefore, we expect buyers to defend this zone, failing which, the trend will turn negative. The next couple of weeks are critical as it will set the direction for the next leg of the move.

Top Stories This Week

Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of long-defunct Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, denied press claims this week that he is returning to blockchain. Karpeles said that his activities with Tristan Technologies will not involve the cryptocurrency sector, as previously reported, and that the firm is not a startup and not related to blockchain. In comments to Cointelegraph, Karpeles said that he wasn’t “sure how this got reported wrong” and that his main goal is to “try to bring back Japan near the top of the IT industry.” A judge acquitted Karpeles of embezzlement in March and is currently appealing a lesser conviction of data manipulation, all in relation to the hack of Mt. Gox.

Canadian startup Kik has been sued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an unregistered $100 million token offering. According to the SEC’s complaint, the commission alleged that Kik’s digital token sale was not compliant with U.S. securities laws, as it had not registered the offering with the proper authorities. The SEC’s complaint comes right after Kik’s recent announcement that the company is launching a $5 million crypto initiative to fund a lawsuit against the SEC, with a campaign called DefendCrypto. Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a press release that, by conducting its kin token sale, Kik “deprived investors of information to which they were legally entitled and prevented investors from making informed investment decisions.”

Justin Sun, Tron founder and CEO, has won an eBay charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett, renowned investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. In order to win the lunch, which Buffett has participated in for 20 years, Sun allegedly bid a record-breaking $4,567,888. The winner will be able to bring along seven friends to a New York steakhouse, and all proceeds from the auction go to San Francisco-based nonprofit Glide Foundation. Sun wrote in a statement that the bid was a key priority for the Tron and BitTorrent team. Buffett has long been known for his negative stance on cryptocurrencies, although he has made positive comments in regard to blockchain.

Global peer-to-peer (p2p) crypto exchange LocalBitcoins officially confirmed this week the removal of trading in local fiat currencies. The Finland-based exchange had previously removed the cash trading option on June 1 with no announcement, which caused some outrage in the crypto community. In an official statement this week, the exchange noted that its liabilities are determined by the Act on Detecting and Preventing Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, which requires them to follow certain regulations. The move comes on the heels of the news that LocalBitcoins will soon become monitored by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Finland, as the Finnish government passed new legislation for crypto assets earlier this year.

Social media giant Facebook will reportedly announce its cryptocurrency project this month, and employees will be allowed to take part of their salary in the coin. According to unnamed sources, the white paper for the coin will be released on June 18. As well, Laura McCracken, Facebook’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, said in an interview this week that the stablecoin would not only involve a U.S. dollar peg. Other media reports this week have noted that there are now 100 people known to be working on the crypto project via profiles on professional networking platform LinkedIn.

“What a difference it would have made a decade ago if blockchain technology on a private distributed ledger accessible to regulators had been the informational foundation of Wall Street’s derivatives exposures.” J. Christopher Giancarlo, United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman

“I don’t think I’m a Neanderthal, which is what I’ve been called when I’ve said I didn’t want to own bitcoin.” Stanley Druckenmiller, American billionaire investor

FUD of the Week

Coinroom, a Polish cryptocurrency exchange, has reportedly shut down its operations and disappeared with customer funds. While the total amount lost has not been disclosed, some users said that they had up to 60,000 zloty (around $15,790) in their accounts. Before ending its operations, Coinroom reportedly asked customers in an email to withdraw their money in one day, while in reality, customers have said that they were unable to get all of their money in this final withdrawal. A spokesperson for the district prosecutor's office in Warsaw said that proceedings had been initiated against Coinroom for unregistered crypto payment services.

According to Twitter user and malware researcher Fumik0_, a new website is spreading cryptocurrency malware. The aforementioned site reportedly imitates the website for Cryptohopper, a site where users can program tools to perform automatic cryptocurrency trading. After a user goes on the site, which displays the logo of Cryptohopper in an attempt to trick the user, it automatically downloads a setup.exe installer that will infect the computer once it runs. The installer infects the computer with an information-stealing Trojan, which then also installs two other Qulab Trojans for mining and clipboard hijacking deployed once every minute to collect data.

Cryptocurrency wallet service GateHub said this week that hackers compromised almost 100 XRP Ledger wallets, resulting in the loss of around $10 million. In a statement, GateHub said that it was notified by community members of the loss of funds, following which it discovered increased application programming interface (API) calls coming from a small number of IP addresses. While one of those who warned GateHub about the breach reported that almost 13,100,000 XRP ($5.37 million) had already been laundered through exchanges and mixer services, GateHub has stated that the investigation is still ongoing.

Now, analysts believe that Ethereum’s current selling pressure could continue to perpetuate, which may lead it to extend its losses to as low as $200 in the near future.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Increasing Selling Pressure as Crypto Markets Plunge

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down over 5% at its current price of $234, down significantly from its daily highs of nearly $250.

Ethereum has been slowly grinding lower over the past week, as it has fallen from weekly highs of over $270 and is currently trading at weekly lows.

Importantly, ETH is currently trading up significantly from its one-month lows of $167, which were set roughly four weeks ago. When considering this, it is clear that the cryptocurrency is still in an uptrend over a longer time frame, despite its recent instability.

Although the uptrend may still be intact, it is important to note that where Ethereum heads next will likely be determined by Bitcoin’s near-term price action, which is, likewise, also looking somewhat bearish.

As for where Ethereum may land before the selling pressure lets up, one analyst believes it is heading for $200.

“$ETH is going to $200 and only a miracle can save it,” Mohit Sorout, a cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter recently said.

Analysts Concur That ETH Has Significantly Further Room to Fall

Sorout is not alone in his assessment that Ethereum may drop significantly further in the near future, as other analysts are currently expressing similarly bearish assessments.

DonAlt, another popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, noted in a recent tweet that he believes ETH could continue dropping until it finds support around its weekly support level that exists between $190 and $200.

“$ETH upd: A few ups and downs later & this still looks terrible to me. I’m glad I jumped off the altpairs are looking good bandwagon at the right time, most of the recent drop is due to ETHBTC underperforming. Bad sign for alts in general. New invalidation = closes above $250,” he said.

How to Generate a Vanity Bitcoin Cash Address

Vanity.cash will allow you to create public addresses in both BCH address format and BTC (legacy) format. The first requires you to start with a lowercase character which can be ‘q’, ‘p’, ‘r’, or ‘z’, and then type in the prefix you want to have for your public address. You can enter any letter or number except for ‘b’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘1’. Legacy addresses can be generated using letters and numbers other than ‘0’, ‘O’, ‘l’, and ‘I’.

You can build an address in the BCH format starting with ‘q’ and continuing with the word ‘cash’, for instance. A short prefix like that will probably cost you nothing. Click the “Get it for free” button at the bottom of the page and you’ll be prompted to choose between two options, ‘compressed’ or ‘uncompressed.’ Then you have to provide an email address where you’ll receive a secure link to your key once it’s generated. Longer phrases would require you to pay for the service with bitcoin cash.

Follow the link to retrieve your custom public address and private key. The Vanity.cash platform is powered by Coin Dance Vanity and you’ll be redirected to a page on its platform. Make sure you have saved your key before leaving it. No one will be able to recover it for you once you’ve closed the tab. While on that page, you can also view the QR codes for the address and the key.

If you need step-by-step guidance on importing private keys into cryptocurrency wallets, you can refer to a tutorial covering popular wallet apps or google “How to import private key into…” adding the name of your wallet. Using Vanity.cash, you can also create custom addresses and keys in a trustless manner. That requires more advanced knowledge and the platform provides a link to a detailed guide.

You can also use the Cash Address Converter developed by Bitcoin.com, an online tool that allows you to convert a Bitcoin Cash address into either the Cashaddr format or the Legacy format. You’ll find more free and useful BCH tools when you visit our Bitcoin Tools page.

The request was made in a joint communiqué published on the website of Japan’s Ministry of Finance on June 9, following the G20 meeting held in Fukuoka, Japan.

The leaders that cosigned the document state that they urge relevant institutions to give greater consideration to crypto assets and consider appropriate action:

“We ask the FSB and standard setting bodies to monitor risks and consider work on additional multilateral responses as needed.”

The joint statement also points out that “technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy.” This exact sentence was also included in the document released after the G20 summit held in July last year in Buenos Aires. After expressing such optimism, the authors of the paper also raised concerns over those technologies:

“While crypto assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we remain vigilant to risks, including those related to consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT).”

The latest statement notes that the involved parties look forward to the adoption of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Interpretive Note and guidance on crypto assets “at its [FATF’s] plenary later this month.” The leaders also state that they reaffirm their commitment to applying the recently amended FATF standards for crypto.

The document also states that the finance ministers and central bank governors welcome work concerning crypto carried out by international regulatory bodies, the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the FSB.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which has “engaged directly with global regulators,” noted that it would be surprising if the involved parties agree on something new during the G20 summit this year.

In April, Japanese media reported that during the meeting of central bank governors and finance ministers in Fukuoka, leaders were expected to establish new AML regulations.",

Not only does data indicate that the number of ID-verified users of cryptocurrency doubled over 2018, but there are various other metrics that suggest that adoption is gaining traction. As many as 84% of companies worldwide are involved with blockchain-based technologies in some way, while cryptocurrency ownership is twice as high among young Americans than among the general United States population. And at a time when there's plenty of talk about the need for crypto to standardize and regulate itself before adoption can really take off, it would now seem that lobbying on cryptocurrency-related issues is also increasing.

This indicator of growth emerged at the end of April, when the U.S. Congress released its latest quarterly data on lobbying on Capitol Hill. Its statistics revealed that the number of companies and organizations lobbying for crypto had increased between Q4 2018 and Q1 2019, with lobbying efforts from the likes of Mastercard, Accenture and EY underlining how the regulatory fate of blockchain and cryptocurrencies isn't of interest only to Coinbase, Coin Center and other representatives of the crypto industry.

It's encouraging that more companies are involving themselves in the issue of cryptocurrency regulation, since, if nothing else, this growth indicates that such regulation is more likely to be drafted in accordance with the views and interests of the organizations that actually have a stake in crypto. However, the recent growth in lobbying is also a sign that lawmakers and regulators aren't moving quickly and decisively enough on crypto legislation, while the preponderance of organizations that didn't originate in the cryptocurrency industry indicates the possibility that this industry might be shaped against the wishes of the wider crypto community.

Top 10 lobbyists interested in crypto

Crypto-related lobbying has been consistently expanding ever since 2017, with last year being a particularly strong one. At the end of 2017, there were only 12 entities lobbying on issues related to blockchain technology or crypto, while a year later there were 33. This already represents impressive growth, yet it would seem that the numbers are still rising, since the latest report – from Q1 2019 – shows an increase to 40.

The specific issues being targeted by lobbyists vary from organization to organization, yet a search of the Lobbying Disclosure Act Database reveals that the biggest areas include cryptocurrency taxation, standardization of concepts and definitions, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) provision. Taken together, these three areas all represent an effort on the part of the cryptocurrency industry to obtain regulatory certainty, through which the industry as a whole should be able to invest, develop and move forward more confidently.

As for which organizations are the biggest spenders, it's perhaps not surprising to learn that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent almost $16.5 million lobbying Congress in the first quarter of the year, although it's safe to assume that most of this wasn't lavished specifically on blockchain- and crypto-related issues. Still, the lobbying group — to which around 300,000 businesses belong as members — did declare in its quarterly report that one of its many specific issues was ""draft legislation on cryptocurrencies,"" while another was ""blockchain and fintech.""

This doesn't reveal much about how exactly it wants the crypto landscape to change, but it's worth noting that it has previously participated in meetings on Capitol Hill that had the aim of promoting regulatory certainty for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). In other words, it would seem that it's aiming to ensure legal clarity for the businesses it represents, so that they know where they stand when it comes to pursuing their own crypto-related projects. And given that it represents upward of 300,000 members, its interest in crypto is a testament to a growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency among the wider (American) business community in general.

The same goes for many of the other “household” names that also lobbied Washington, D.C. between January and March of this year. After the Chamber of Commerce, the next biggest spender with an interest in either blockchain or crypto was the National Association of Manufacturers, which had $2.3 million to spend on lobbying in the first quarter of 2019. It was fairly tight-lipped as to its specific interest in crypto, however, since it simply entered ""blockchain"" as one of its lobbying issues, without further explanation.

Luckily, IBM was more helpful in its lobbying reports, which revealed that it shed just over $2 million on a broad spectrum of lobbying activities. As the first of its two reports for the quarter disclosed, one of its interests was blockchain — and in particular, the need for Congress to arrive at a legally conclusive definition of blockchain technology, as suggested by its lobbying on the Blockchain Promotion Act.

While hardly as well known as IBM, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association was big enough to spend $1.54 million on a number of concerns. And much like IBM, it also lobbied on the same Blockchain Promotion Act, once more indicating that there are a growing number of companies that are desperate for the U.S. government and regulators to settle on clear regulation, standards and definitions with regard to the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.

And while the Entertainment Software Association didn't specifically lobby on the Blockchain Promotion Act, it nonetheless focused on regulatory certainty, turning its attention in Q1 2019 to the appropriately named Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. It spent $1.18 million on lobbying overall, although judging by the large number of issues spanning privacy, cybersecurity, net neutrality and online safety for children, its main focus wasn't crypto.

Next is Ernst & Young (EY), which splashed out $990,000 on lobbying. Once again, most of this probably went to noncrypto issues, yet EY also declared a lobbying interest in ""general issues related to FinTech and crypto-assets,"" and also general issues ""related to innovation, emerging technologies, and blockchain."" It had, in March, also launched a tool for calculating the tax owed on cryptocurrencies, so it's possible that some of its lobbying time was focused on tax regulation for cryptocurrencies.

Shifting to another accountancy and professional services firm, Accenture spent $710,000 in the first quarter of 2019. It lobbied on such issues as artificial intelligence (AI), privacy and cybersecurity, as well as on ""Emerging Technology (blockchain),"" providing no other details than this little cryptic reference. Still, it has become a known advocate and adoptee of blockchain technology in recent years, having published a number of blockchain-based patents and begun using a blockchain solution for employee benefits, and having recently joined the European Commission-launched International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA).

Only slightly behind Accenture in the lobbying stakes is Fidelity Investments (aka FMR LLC), which spent $640,000 on a wide range of issues, including asset management, systemic risk regulation, equity markets, and of course ""digital assets."" Interestingly, it published a report at the beginning of May on cryptocurrency adoption, noting that a ""lack of clarity around regulation"" was one of the biggest obstacles to digital asset investment cited by institutional investors.

Another big obstacle to investment is, unsurprisingly, the possibility that most cryptocurrencies are likely to be classified as securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Token Taxonomy Act seeks to exempt cryptocurrencies from this classification, and it was lobbied for by the National Venture Capital Association, which spent just over $585,000 overall ($525,000 and $60,000) on lobbying in the first quarter.

Rounding out the top 10 of crypto-interested lobbying organizations was the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC). Spending $480,000 on a spectrum of insurance-related issues, it also lobbied on the aforementioned Blockchain Promotion Act, possibly indicating that its 1,400-plus members want clarity on what blockchain legally is, so that they can then go about adopting their own blockchain-based solutions.

What's interesting about NAMIC and the other top-10 lobbying groups is that none of them operate primarily within the crypto industry. As such, their interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain highlights just how much crypto has taken root in the general corporate and business landscape, indicating that mainstream adoption of blockchain is gradually accelerating.

The best of the rest

There are, of course, other companies that lobbied Congress on crypto-related issues. However, while there isn't space to detail what each and every one of them did in the first quarter of the year, here's a rundown of what the remaining members of the top 30 spent.

As with Digital Asset Affairs, the remaining companies that engaged in lobbying also spent under $5,000, implying that their sway over lawmakers might not be as considerable as the top 30 spenders. Nonetheless, taking these organizations as a whole, it's clear that the vast majority of them have all been pushing to establish a favorable regulatory framework in which the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries have the necessary space to develop.

Aside from the organizations all lobbying for regulatory clarity, it's worth pointing out that certain others are also aiming to secure exemptions for cryptocurrencies from existing securities legislation. This is what the Chamber of Digital Commerce, for one, is doing, with its lobbying report revealing that it's lobbying in favor of the Token Taxonomy Act and that it wants to ""amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exclude digital tokens from the definition of a security.""

The ultimate aim of such legislation and lobbying is to provide the crypto industry with the stimulus and certainty to develop as strongly as possible, and it's in this context that the increase in lobbying becomes significant. Not only is this increase a sign of adoption, but it's also a sign that adoption is being hampered by unclear regulations and laws. A growing number of companies want these regulations and laws to be amended and cleared away so that businesses can proceed as concertedly and as rapidly as they'd like with the development and deployment of new crypto-based solutions.

Hence the recent rise in lobbying, particularly from large corporations and associations that stand to gain from the use of blockchain, but that also want the reassurance that such use will observe all relevant laws.

The taming of crypto?

On the other hand, it might be somewhat disconcerting for the cryptocurrency community that lobbying on crypto-related issues now appears to be driven largely by non-crypto organizations. While there is, of course, no indication that the likes of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, IBM or Ernst & Young are actively lobbying for legislation that will prejudice the wider crypto ecosystem, it's possible that their respective interests might neglect certain things that members of this ecosystem might want.

For example, even if the Chamber of Digital Commerce (a blockchain advocacy group) is lobbying for the exemption of cryptocurrencies from securities law, it's telling that no member of the top 10 lobbying groups — apart from the National Venture Capital Association — is doing the same. By focusing mostly on regulatory “clarity,” such organizations as Fidelity Investments and the Entertainment Software Association are arguably distracting lawmakers from the benefits that could be had if the U.S. were to exempt cryptocurrencies from securities law. As a result, the growth in crypto-related lobbying might ultimately have the effect of sanitizing crypto and making it less dynamic.

There's also the fact that at least one influential organization within the crypto community — the Bitcoin Foundation — terminated its lobbying activities in the first quarter of the year. It had previously lobbied against S.1241, a bill that would require anyone internationally transacting more than $10,000 in cryptocurrency to file a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments. This was regarded by the industry as a restrictive piece of legislation that would hamper the operation and development of crypto. So, seeing as how the only other organization listed above to explicitly oppose the bill has been Coin Center, the exit of the Bitcoin Foundation from lobbying is potentially bad news for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Still, even if crypto-related lobbying is increasingly being dominated by noncrypto companies, the cryptocurrency industry has been improving its political activism game recently. Aside from spending more on lobbying activities, it has also been forming such advocacy groups as the Blockchain Association and Blockchain for Europe, which in addition to lobbying also engage in educational and promotional on the industry's behalf. This is why there's every reason to believe that crypto's interests will be more substantially represented in the future, and that the adoption indicated by lobbying will only increase further.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-parliament-considers-imposing-fines-on-crypto-mining-by-end-of-june,"Russia’s parliament, the State Duma, is considering imposing administrative responsibility for the mining of cryptocurrencies, local news outlet TASS reported on June 7.

In an interview with TASS, Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, said that the government may introduce administrative responsibility for digital currency mining by the end of June. Aksakov stated:

“I note that any operations with cryptocurrency that are contrary to the Russian legislation will be considered illegitimate. This means that mining, organizing issuance, circulation, creating exchange points for these tools will be prohibited. Administrative liability in the form of a fine will be incurred for such actions. We believe that cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains such as bitcoins, ethers, and others are illegitimate tools.”

Aksakov, however, stressed that despite the mining ban in Russia, it is still possible to own bitcoin (BTC) if it was acquired under foreign law at foreign sale and exchange points.

He also suggested that a mainstream interest in bitcoin could appear again once the speed of transactions increases.

Russia’s major crypto bill, “On Digital Financial Assets,” had been approved by the Russian parliament in May 2018, but was subsequently sent back to the first reading stage after reports of its lack of major key concepts such as crypto mining, cryptocurrencies, and tokens.

Russia has since further postponed the adoption of the crypto legislation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) concerning the addition of the crypto-related terms.

Earlier in June, Lyudmila Novoselova, chairman at the Court for Intellectual Rights of Russian Federation and a judge at the Supreme Arbitration Court, had also argued that the term digital assets should be included in the Russian Civil Law.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-sparrow-exchange-makes-trading-options-simple-and-secure/,"PR: Sparrow Makes Trading Options Simple and Secure

To serve a diverse ecosystem, the Sparrow Dollar (SP$) is used as the settlement currency of the Sparrow platform.

Bitcoin.com is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods or services mentioned in the press release.",2019-06-10 09:30:23+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmex-cryptocompare-and-refinitiv-to-jointly-build-real-time-crypto-futures-dataset,"Crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and provider of crypto data CryptoCompare will jointly build a real-time crypto futures dataset, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on June 10.

The BitMEX cryptocurrency futures dataset is designed for institutional investors, and will be delivered to financial markets data provider Refinitiv through the CryptoCompare contributions conduit. The tool will eventually be integrated into the Refinitiv Eikon, a set of software products for financial professionals to monitor and analyze financial information.

The product is set to increase transparency and confidence in the cryptocurrency markets and subsequently attract greater institutional participation in the digital asset class. Commenting on the initiative, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said:

“When it comes to trading, good decision-making depends on access to solid data insights. We are pleased to deliver a new wealth of data on cryptocurrency futures for institutional investors that can contribute to their overall confidence throughout their decision-making process.”

CryptoCompare initially entered into a partnership with information company Thomson Reuters last July to provide order book and trade data on 50 cryptocurrencies for the Eikon platform.

At the time, CryptoCompare founder and CEO Charles Hayter stated that as the markets mature, they had seen rising interest from institutional investors.

In April, Nasdaq added Brave New Coin’s XRP Price Index to its global data service, having added Brave New Coin’s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) in February.",,https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/draft-bill-proposing-jail-for-cryptocurrency-trades-in-india-causes-stir-1560153606691.html,"New Delhi: A recent draft bill that proposes a jail term for anyone dealing in cryptocurrencies continues to cause a stir in India and in the cryptocurrency market around the world.

Bloomberg mentioned the jail term in a report on 7 June, following a 26 April report in The Economic Times, which talked about the proposed legislation—Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019—being “circulated to relevant government departments"".

However, according to a right to information (RTI) request filed on 4 June by Varun Sethi, a lawyer specializing in blockchain, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says it is not in the know of the proposed ban.

The RBI, however, has not encouraged the use of bitcoins, and the sale of bitcoins currently is taxed in India. There are an estimated three million bitcoins in circulation in the country.

Regardless, cryptocurrency experts believe that fretting over the draft at this stage may not help. “It’s too premature to come to a conclusion on this,"" said Vishal Gupta, CEO of many crypto-based startups, such as SearchTrade and Binex, citing that this is a private bill at the moment.

Gupta also said that while a section of the bill has been talked about, it actually says that illegal dealings in cryptocurrencies will be illegal —which is like saying paying rupees for illegal activities will be illegal.

Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder, Unocoin, said he doesn’t think the bill will be able to stop the dealings in cryptocurrencies even if it does come into effect. “Transactions are completely online,"" he said. “It’s impossible to tell where it’s happening from.""

According to Vishwanath, it would be a bad idea for the government to ban cryptocurrency in India, because it might drive transactions underground. As long as there’s a way to bring this money into regulated means, there’s a way to trace it and stop illegal activities, he said, adding that last December’s RBI order, which banned entities regulated by it to deal with, or provide services to individuals or businesses dealing in virtual currencies, a lot of people had moved their cryptocurrencies out of the country.

This seems to be an important point. Ashish Singh, CEO of bZird, a digital marketing firm, said many cryptocurrency users in India keep their money abroad. Singh, who is part of cryptocurrency groups on WhatsApp and has dealt in virtual currencies, said the bill may not hurt the “really big users"".

According to him, many Indian users don’t actually hold cryptocurrency accounts in their own name. Instead, they have friends in other countries who buy and sell currencies for them, and send the money through platforms such as PayPal.

A user on a cryptocurrency WhatsApp group called Crypto Tech Stories wrote: “So, as of now, if we want to get withdrawal, need to get it from someone in US or other countries.""

“Honestly, I don’t think the government will go this way. India is part of the G20, and countries within that have worked hard to regulate such currencies,"" one person, who ran a cryptocurrency company in India, but had to shut it down following the RBI order, said requesting anonymity.

What kind of stocks stir up controversy like no other? Penny stocks. These tickers trading for less than $5 per share have earned a reputation as some of the most divisive names on Wall Street, with these plays either met with open arms or given the cold shoulder.It’s understandable why some investors are wary. Those opposed are quick to point out that there could be a very real reason these stocks are changing hands for pocket change, with the low share prices often masking obstacles like weak fundamentals or troubling headwinds. That said, others are drawn in by the sheer growth potential of penny stocks. The fact is that even minor share price appreciation can mean huge percentage gains, and thus, serious returns. What’s more, your money goes further with these bargain names.No matter which side you take, one thing is certain, due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions. That’s where the experts come in, namely the analysts at Roth Capital. These pros bring experience and in-depth knowledge to the table.With this in mind, our focus turned to two penny stocks that have received a thumbs up from Roth Capital analysts. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, both have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Not to mention substantial upside potential is on the table.Cellectar Biosciences (CLRB)Leveraging its patented phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) delivery platform, Cellectar Biosciences develops cutting-edge treatments for cancer. Based on the potential of its drug candidate, CLR 131, and its $1.24 share price, Roth Capital thinks that now is the time to get in on the action.Representing the firm, analyst Jonathan Aschoff tells clients that he is optimistic about CLR 131, which is a small-molecule, targeted PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells, in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) indications. According to Aschoff, following its Type B guidance meeting with the FDA, “CLRB is prepared to initiate its first pivotal CLR 131 trial in LPL/WM after achieving a 100% ORR and 75% major response rate in four patients.” He points out that although CLRB just reported promising results in multiple myeloma (MM) (40% ORR in triple class refractory (TCR) patients at total body doses of at least 60mCi), LPL/WM was selected for the initial pivotal trial based on the very strong initial results and the lower competition for patients.“We view this as a prudent decision because NCCN compedia listing in MM is a mere peer-reviewed publication away, if first approved in LPL/WM. We also note that CLRB has steadily improved its dosing of CLR 131, essentially fractionating the doses so that higher total body doses are well tolerated,” Aschoff further explained. Adding to the good news, the therapy generated activity in preliminary Phase 1 unresectable brain tumors. Aschoff added, “Disease control was shown in two heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas, showing the drug's ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and all doses through 60 mCi/m2 have exhibited a favorable safety profile.”To this end, Aschoff rates CLRB a Buy along with a $10 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 713%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Aschoff’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: CLRB is a Strong Buy. Given the $5.48 average price target, shares could soar 345% from current levels. (See CLRB stock analysis on TipRanks)Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)With vast gene therapy experience, Applied Genetic Technologies designs and constructs all critical gene therapy elements and brings them together to develop successful treatments for patients. Currently going for $4.50 apiece, Roth Capital believes this stock’s long-term growth narrative is strong.Firm analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out that recently released data for its XLRP gene therapy program, which is expected to enter pivotal studies in Q1 2021, reaffirmed his bullish thesis. “Despite the market not fully appreciating the data given how the stock traded, we continue to believe that the results suggest that AGTC could have a best-in-class therapy, which is supportive of the planned pivotal efforts,” he explained.Providing an update on the results of the Phase 1/2 XLRP study, using the FDA's criteria, AGTC evaluated responses at 12 months in the lower dose groups (2 and 4), and 6 months in the higher dose groups (5 and 6). According to Jallah, “initial responses were observed in dose Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with impressive response durability even at 12 months.”On top of this, at 6 months, the dose used in Group 5 resulted in a 43% response rate or a 57% response rate if excluding a patient not meeting the enrollment criteria. In Group 6, a response rate of 50% was observed, or 100% excluding patients not meeting the enrollment criteria.Jallah added, “All measurements were obtained in the 36 perimetry grid, which we believe should make it easier to preselect loci likely to respond. Although BCVA is not the primary endpoint, BCVA improvements, which can capture changes in the central region, were maintained at 12 months.”Even though some investors have expressed concern about Meira’s competing therapy, Jallah believes AGTC’s technology could have a leg up. “Overall, we believe that the data from both companies is strongly indicative of the efficacy potential of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease, and although differences in the study design makes direct comparisons difficult, we believe that AGTC could have a competitive advantage heading into pivotal studies,” he commented.In line with his optimistic approach, Jallah reiterated a Buy rating and $30 price target, indicating 568% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here)All in all, other analysts echo Jallah’s sentiment. 5 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $18.25 is less aggressive than Jallah’s but still leaves room for upside potential of 306%.

Back in April 2018, it was revealed that Yahoo Japan was planning to launch a cryptocurrency exchange licensed by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA). Now, a year later, Yahoo Japan’s trading platform Taotao is open offering BTC and ETH trading while also providing users with margin trading available in litecoin (LTC), ripple (XRP) and bitcoin cash (BCH).

Yahoo Japan’s Taotao Exchange Has Launched

Yahoo Japan Corporation has officially entered the cryptocurrency trading industry with its newly launched exchange Taotao. Yahoo Japan is an internet company tethered to the American multimedia corporation Yahoo. The web portal operated by Yahoo Japan is the most visited website in the country, offering services like email, Roku, Gyao, Geocities, auctions, shopping, and travel. The company’s exchange was initially called Bitarg up until Yahoo Japan acquired the trading platform last February and renamed it Taotao. The trading platform is fully licensed with the FSA as a Japanese virtual currency exchange business association type 1 member.

Taotao President, Shinichiro Arakawa, announced the launch of the platform on May 30, 2019, with an initial commemoration campaign that gives traders zero fees for 30 days. Additionally, for BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, and LTC margin trading, the open position management fees from leverage transactions are waived for the first month. Taotao launched the web portal with its slogan “New money, new world,” and the company believes Taotao makes it easier for cryptocurrency users to trade in a safe manner. The Taotao trading platform can be used in a browser but the exchange also offers a mobile trading experience with its Android and iOS applications. Users can trade with BTC and ETH in a traditional spot market fashion with their smartphone while also playing with leverage on LTC, XRP, and BCH.

The Yahoo Japan-backed Taotao claims to offer top-notch trading in a completely isolated environment from the external networks. Funds are kept in cold storage and Taotao also offers multi-signature technology which requires the approval from multiple individuals at the time of withdrawal. In order to prevent unauthorized logins, Taotao requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for accounts. One interesting thing to note about registering for Taotao is users can sign up with a Yahoo Japan ID to make the process much quicker. Still, in order to be fully verified, users are required to provide a photo ID in order to obtain approval. After the Coincheck breach in January 2018, Japanese exchanges have to abide by strict rules in order to acquire a license to operate a virtual currency trading platform. Yahoo Japan’s Taotao platform is among 19 FSA approved cryptocurrency exchanges within the country.

Crypto Exchange Competition in Japan Is Growing

Yahoo Japan’s entry into the cryptocurrency trading environment will surely help give digital assets further mainstream attention. There have already been advertisements on Yahoo Japan’s web portal when the company announced the pre-registration account openings for March 25 and gave up to 11,000 yen in reimbursements for advance registrations.

Taotao will compete with a slew of trading platforms and the Japanese forerunner Bitflyer, one of the world’s leading digital asset exchanges by volume. For instance, on Monday, June 10, Bitflyer has processed over $58 million or 7,315 BTC worth of trade volume in the last 24 hours. Moreover, last April news.Bitcoin.com also reported on a few other Japanese exchange newcomers that will compete against Taotao.

One of those examples is the Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange, which initiated services in Japan during the last week of April. Fisco Digital Asset Group (FDAG) previously worked with Tech Bureau Inc., the firm which operated the hacked exchange Zaif, and FDAG decided to relaunch services seven months later. Then there’s the recent opening of Huobi Japan last January, which introduced LTC, BCH, MONA, BTC, ETH, and XRP trading to Japanese traders. Huobi Group managed a merger with Bittrade and rebranded into Huobi Japan after acquiring a license to operate under the FSA’s stricter guidelines. Taotao will also be challenged by the new platform Decurret and the revamped Rakuten service in Japan.

Announced Monday, companies that want to offer tax and HR-compliant ether benefits can sign up to offer it as a benefit to employees.

The company has been providing direct deposits of bitcoin since 2014, and serves over 30,000 workers. Employees, freelancers and independent contractors can receive from their clients or employers any percentage of their fiat obligations due to them in crypto.

The company has experimented with the ethereum ecosystem since 2017, including launching the consulting services firm Inwage, which built several projects on the second-largest blockchain. This includes the Moria initial coin offering, which raised $50 million, and a pilot project for a major insurance company that leverages ethereum for audit trail capabilities.

But adding ether to Bitwage’s main offering “took a lot of behind the scenes work… because the whole system was optimized for BTC,” a company representative told CoinDesk. “It’s just a matter of now having gotten the infrastructure to add it.”

When Bitwage was founded five years ago, CEO Johnathan Chester realized that merchants were already accepting bitcoin, but there was no way for employees to get paid in it as well.

“Our goal was to close the financial loop,” Chester said in a statement. The company currently processes $2.5 million in monthly volume for contractors and full-time employees.

Bitwage provides two payment services, direct deposit – in which employees have part of their salaries sent to the company to be exchanged for crypto automatically through dollar cost averaging – as well as team wages, where Bitwage provides companywide payroll services. Team wage contracts are primarily provided for companies that may want to pay hundreds of contract employees spread across the globe with just one payment, the representative said.

Though the company makes a spread on the exchange, there is no fee for the basic service. There is also a premium version, which provides payments sooner and costs $15.99 per month.

Square offers a similar service where an employee’s direct deposit goes to the payments platform, but the employee has to manually swap it for bitcoin. Coinbase allows automatic monthly purchases of crypto out of a customer’s bank account.

Several blue-chip companies have employees that use Bitwage to automatically convert their cash salaries into crypto including Amazon, Google, and Apple. Additionally, many gig workers for Uber, Caviar, and Doordash utilize the services, according to the representative.

Bitwage clients can have up to two payments distributions per pay period in either fiat or crypto as a non-premium user, or three for premium.

The company has received around $1 million in total funding from such investors as Draper Associates, Candela Reach Capital, and BPI France.

The news was revealed in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on June 11.

The new product, dubbed the “Nasdaq/CryptoCompare Aggregate Crypto Reference Prices,” will be made available on the Nasdaq-owned platform Quandl — which reportedly provides financial and economic alternative datasets for over 400,000 financial professionals globally.

The new Nasdaq-CryptoCompare pricing product will be based on CryptoCompare’s aggregate index datasets, which provide ostensibly minute-by-minute pricing data from those cryptocurrency markets that have the highest liquidity.

The product aims to enhance institutional investors’ capabilities in the crypto markets, across “trading strategy, quantitative research, risk modelling, NAV calculations and back-testing,” the press release notes.

In an official statement, CryptoCompare CEO and co-founder Charles Hayter has argued that “reliable data is the bedrock of transparent, liquid markets,” and can offer global, institutional investors and traders a competitive edge in the crypto sector.

In late 2018, Nasdaq had ostensibly confirmed its plans to launch bitcoin futures in the first half of 2019, having deferred an earlier planned rollout.

In February 2019, Nasdaq started listing two cryptocurrency price indices from United States blockchain and crypto market data firm Brave New Coin (BNC), including BNC’s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX).

Cryptocompare has meanwhile just this week partnered with major crypto derivatives platform BitMEX to jointly construct a real-time crypto futures dataset, which will be delivered to financial markets data provider Refinitiv.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/coinbase-expands-its-cryptocurrency-debit-card-to-europe.html,"Coinbase launched its own debit card in an effort to promote the use of cryptocurrencies in payments as well as investing.

",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/philippines-central-bank-will-continue-to-closely-monitor-crypto-citing-terror-financing,"The governor of the Philippines’ central bank, Benjamin Diokno, has warned against the potential use of cryptocurrencies for terrorism financing and underscored that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will continue to closely monitor their use in the country. The news was reported by local English language newspaper The Philippine Star on June 10.

In addition to Diokno’s remarks, BSP Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo reportedly provided further insights into the institution’s stance toward cryptocurrencies during the launch of an unnamed book about bitcoin (BTC).

Diokno ostensibly criticized bitcoin’s potential to function as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value, claiming that the top cryptocurrency’s volatility inhibits its usefulness on all three points.

The governor reportedly recognized that blockchain and certain implementations of distributed ledger technologies can be useful for payments and settlements for peer-to-peer transactions, presenting this as a potential risk to the traditional banking sector:

“Game theory dictates possible dysfunction when there is market breakdown, when everyone may distrust one another. There cannot be a total disregard for a central bank or a third party that provides lender of last resort facility.”

Guinigundo said the central bank would approach fintech development using regulatory sandboxes in order to balance the prospective benefits of innovative financial technologies with robust consumer and investor protection.

The Philippine Star cites fresh data from BSP’s Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department, which has reportedly revealed that the value of cryptocurrency transactions almost doubled in 2018 — hitting $390.37 million as compared with $189.18 million in 2017.

The data breakdown indicated that conversion from fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies accounted for $208.27 million, crypto-fiat conversion for $173.33 million, and crypto-enabled international incoming remittances for $8.77 million.

In February of this year, the Philippines introduced a new set of rules governing the issuance and acquisition of utility and security tokens.

BSP has required domestic crypto exchanges to register as remittance and transfer companies and implement specific safeguards — covering AML, CFT, risk management and consumer protection — since February 2017.

Earlier this month, BitMEX Ventures invested in a crypto exchange officially licensed by BSP, and in April, payment services firm Bitspark revealed plans to release a cryptocurrency pegged to the Philippines’ national fiat currency, the peso.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/crypto-exchanges-are-facing-biggest-regulatory-hurdle-yet,"Why did this happen?

South Korea’s largest bank by assets, KB Kookmin, has partnered with a cryptocurrency startup to develop custody solutions.

South Korea’s Kookmin U-Turns on Crypto

Reported by local media outlet Business Korea June 11, Kookmin will now work with local company Atomrigs Lab, which is active in digital asset protection.

The move marks a decisive change of tack for Kookmin, which until recently appeared to have a hands-off stance on cryptocurrency in general.

South Korea continues to be a hotspot for cryptocurrency activity in areas such as trading, with mixed regulatory signals failing to dampen consumer enthusiasm this year.

“We hope that the two companies will grow together by discovering innovative services in the field of digital asset management with this agreement,” Lee Koo-il, CEO of Kookmin Bank, meanwhile commented after inking the partnership on Monday.

We will expand the digital ecosystem through cooperation.

Crypto, Blockchain Options On Radar

The exact outcome of the joint development plans with Atomrigs remains less certain but incorporates a wide range of technologies associated with both cryptocurrency storage and Blockchain.

According to Business Korea, the two will “jointly study digital asset protection technology and smart contract application methods… and opted to actively explore new business opportunities in the field of digital assets.”

“The company will also develop digital asset management services that combine Atomrigs Lab’s technology with Kookmin Bank’s internal control infrastructure and information protection technologies,” the publication continued.

In addition, the two companies have agreed to cooperate with each other in the creation of a bridge ecosystem between the blockchain network and finance.

World’s No.1 Insurer Inks Crypto Custody Insurance

Last year, Kookmin had come under fire from South Korea regulators over its poor anti-money laundering procedures regarding transactions originating from cryptocurrency sources.

Worldwide, banks offering crypto custody solutions meanwhile looks set to become an ever-increasing trend.

Attempts thus far have taken various forms, such as Dutch lender ABN Amro’s in-house crypto wallet, which controversially stipulates the bank holds investors’ private keys.

This week, the world’s second-larger insurer Metaco announced it was now offering crypto custody insurance via a deal with Aon.

“Insurance is an essential requirement for banking clients and METACO is excited to be able to facilitate insurance for our clients through the leading broker for crypto insurance solutions,” Metaco CEO and founder Adrien Treccani commented in an accompanying press release.

As Bitcoinist reported, institutional investment in Bitcoin 00 and other cryptocurrencies are expected to constitute a major phenomenon in the coming years. In May, a survey by pro-crypto asset manager Fidelity Investments revealed half of investors considered crypto a worthy sector for their portfolio.

In the name of the father, the son, and the HODL spirit … amen. Rick Santorum — former Pennsylvania senator, two-time failed Republican presidential candidate, conservative Catholic — is getting into cryptocurrency. He’s an adviser on the board of a new company called Cathio, which says it “provides Catholic organizations with a payments platform that aligns with Catholic values, provides the tools necessary to increase donations and connect with both local and global Catholic communities.” Santorum’s son-in-law is Cathio’s CEO.

From the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog:

There are some other big hitters on the board too, including former US ambassador to the Vatican Jim Nicholson, and former head of the US Mint Ed Moy, who also happens to have been an adviser for “bitcoin IRA”, an investment fund that encourages people to put their retirement savings into crypto (what could possibly go wrong, etc). Also on the board — and co-founder of Cathio — is Cameron Chell, chairman of ICOx Innovations, the company that ran Kodak’s infamous “Kodakcoin” ICO, which managed to raise less than 7 per cent of its target.

Santorum, via a press release, said he thinks Cathio is a way to connect with young Catholics. “Millennials don’t carry cash, they date on apps and watch on-demand entertainment,” he said. “We have to be there, we have to learn from successful tech companies, and we have to provide a universal solution that makes it easy for younger generations to engage with the Church.” Translation: We thought if we put the word “blockchain” near the word “Catholicism,” we might pull in some millennials.

Another way Cathio is “learning from successful tech companies” is by charging a 2 percent transaction fee. All I have to say is that “Vaticoin” was sitting right there, guys.",2019-06-11 18:23:38.061000+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/trading/exante-launches-trading-on-binance-coin-bnb-fund/,"EXANTE has pushed ahead with its plans to broaden its cryptocurrency offering with the launch of a crypto fund pegged to Binance Coin (BNB), the native token associated with the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Binance Coin (BNB) is a utility token that was initially created to help the crypto venue with its financial needs. After Binance reached its funding goal, it has been using its profits to buy back the tokens and ‘burn’ them to reduce the overall circulating supply. This process will continue until 50 percent of all BNB are burned, or approximately 100 million tokens.

Binance Coin is also used by participants to cut their fees when trading in and out of altcoins on the platform.

In addition to BNB, EXANTE customers can already trade over 20 funds pegged to crypto assets. The Malta-based broker debuted its Bitcoin-only hedge fund back in 2013. At the time, cryptocurrency trading was carried out through EXANTE crypto funds, which allow buying bitcoin and 15 popular altcoins.

A crypto offering from the very beginning

Exante offered the Bitcoin Fund with an initial minimum subscription of $100,000 and a 0.5 percent fee for subscriptions and redemptions (1 Bitcoin Fund share = 1 bitcoin). There’s also a commission of a 1.75 percent annual fee (payable in bitcoin to preserve the ratio) for managing the security necessary to safeguard the private keys.

Also in 2017, Exante launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which allows clients to speculate on prices of popular alternative cryptocurrencies. XAI Fund is secured by the real cryptocurrencies included in the index, and it did not include Bitcoin into the list to make the offering more diversified.

EXANTE has been one of the few brokers that jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon from the very beginning. The company started the Bitcoin fund six years ago, which allowed trading that specific cryptocurrency, then added more popular altcoins such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, and Ripple.

Finance Magnates also reported on Exante last year when its new venture capital fund ‘Exantech’ announced its first investment – $10 million in cryptocurrency miner Comino.",2019-06-11 13:49:10+00:00

Coinbase Card Expands Across Europe

San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it is expanding its Visa debit card service in six new European countries. Coinbase Card, which was launched in the U.K. in April, will now be made available to customers in Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The service enables account holders from the supported countries to spend their crypto balances in a familiar way to anyone with a debit or credit card.

The Coinbase-powered cards are issued by Paysafe Financial Services, part of the same multinational online payments group which operates Neteller and Skrill, and is regulated by the U.K’s Financial Conduct Authority. Customers of the exchange who wish to order the card need to sign up for a waitlist using the associated mobile app. Once the list is closed their balances will be spendable via an in-app virtual card while a physical card will be sent in the mail.

Crypto Cards Bring New Options for Spending BCH

The card supports all digital assets available on the Coinbase platform such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and customers can use it to pay in millions of locations where Visa is accepted, as well as to make fiat cash withdrawals from ATMs. The company has explained that when customers use their cards it instantly converts the selected crypto assets into fiat which is received by the merchant.

If you are not a Coinbase account holder or reside in an unsupported country, there are a host of other options available for using your BCH with a debit card. Hong Kong headquartered platform Crypto.com recently added support for BCH, Spain-based Bitnovo’s Bitsa card is another option and you can find additional BCH supporting cards here.

Bitcoin’s price consolidation in a tight range continues for the eighth day, as litecoin rallies to its highest level since May 2018.

BTC’s 4-hour chart shows $8,053 is the level to beat for the bulls. A high-volume break higher could be followed by a rise to $8,500.

LTC looks set to extend its recent rally as per the 3-day chart.

LTC already rallied more than 100 percent in the last six weeks, so a pullback to $120 could be seen before further gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) is lacking a clear directional bias for the eighth consecutive day amid a continued rally in litecoin’s (LTC) price.

The price of a single bitcoin – the world’s leading cryptocurrency market value – has been restricted to a $600 range since June 5. While any drops to $7,500 have been consistently short-lived, buyers have also repeatedly failed to engineer a convincing break above $8,100.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5-percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

With BTC so indecisive, major alternative cryptocurrencies like ethereum’s ether token, XRP, bitcoin cash and EOS are also struggling for clear direction.

Litecoin, however, is flashing 6.5 percent gains on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap. The fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $141 on Bitstamp earlier today, the highest level since May 2018.

More notably, at the current price of $136, LTC is up nearly 40 percent from lows below $100 seen just seven days ago. Meanwhile, BTC is up 4 percent on a weekly basis.

With the mining reward halving due on Aug. 8 – a process that could lead to a supply deficit and a resultant upwards pressure on prices – LTC is again leading BTC higher.

BTC 4-hour chart

As seen above, BTC has created a sideways channel inside a falling channel, so a break above $8,063 would confirm two channel breakouts and open the doors to $8,500.

It is worth noting that the breakout could be short-lived if trading volumes continue to remain low.

On the downside, the higher low of $7,713 is the immediate support. A violation there would expose the lower edge of the sideways channel, currently at $7,500.

LTC 3-day chart

Litecoin’s relative strength index is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout – a bullish continuation pattern.

The 5- and 10-candle averages continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup.

Further, LTC has consistently seen higher volumes on days of positive price action compared to days of negative price action. Therefore, the path of least resistance looks to be to the higher side.

That said, a pullback to the 5-candle MA support, currently located at $122, could be seen before further gains, as the cryptocurrency has rallied 118 percent in the last 6 weeks and the bulls often take a breather following such stellar rallies.

That research, by economist Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, concluded that mining operations might account for 0.5% of worldwide electricity use by the end of 2018—and eventually as much as 5%.

Bitcoin mining’s toll

The new study by researchers at MIT and the Technical University of Munich suggests that Bitcoin mining was consuming 45.8 terawatt-hours of electricity per year as of November 2018. That, in turn, produced estimated annual emissions of between 22 and 23 megatons of carbon dioxide, slotting the operations between the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka in terms of greenhouse-gas pollution.

Including other cryptocurrencies in the calculation more than doubles estimates of how much energy is being used.

Using data disclosed in the IPO filings of Bitcoin hardware companies Bitmain, Canaan, and Ebang, the researchers were able to determine the types and market share of hardware being used by miners. By relying upon the manufacturers’ estimates of energy efficiency—and taking into account requirements for cooling, transformers, and other parts of the mining operation—they were then able to estimate the overall power consumption of the Bitcoin network.

The team also used the IP addresses of devices to determine the geographical location of mining operations, from which they could then calculate emissions considering the mix of electricity sources in those regions. Together, this allowed the researchers to approximate the overall carbon footprint.

Cryptocurrency issues

But not everyone was convinced the new paper delivers the definitive assessment of Bitcoin. Jonathan Koomey, a researcher who has long studied the effects of information technology on energy use and emissions, said in an email that there are several reasons to view the latest estimates cautiously.

First, the volatility of the cryptocurrency market means the impact in November 2018 doesn’t necessarily reflect the impact today, as mining rises and falls with prices.

In addition, Koomey noted in a paper earlier this year that manufacturers’ own estimates of energy efficiency aren’t necessarily reliable. The fluctuating numbers of servers installed, the complexity of mining operations, shifting computational loads, and other factors complicate the ability to accurately estimate total electricity use at any point in time.

Even if we can’t ascertain the exact level of Bitcoin-related emissions, we do know one thing for certain: they’re too high. While there are some proposed alternatives to the current, energy-intensive process of mining, none of these are game-ready yet.

To be sure, 23 megatons of carbon dioxide is a relatively small share of the roughly 30,000 megatons of energy-related emissions globally each year, and an even tinier slice of total emissions generated economy-wide. But the last thing the world needs to do right now is invent new ways of generating additional carbon dioxide at a point when we should be slashing emissions as rapidly as possible to confront climate change.",2019-06-12,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-futures-analysis-idUSKCN1TE0IB,"LONDON (Reuters) - When bitcoin was born it was a symbol of counterculture, a rebel currency with near-anonymity and a lack of regulation. A decade later, there are growing signs it’s entering the establishment its creators sought to subvert.

As the cryptocurrency has surged in value bigger investors, from trading firms to hedge funds, have increasingly turned to exchanges regulated in traditional financial centers. They are buying bitcoin futures to gain exposure to the asset while avoiding the hacks and heists that plague the industry.

The crypto market, associated by many with the dark web, money laundering and the Wild West, is beginning to be discussed by financiers in the same breath as derivatives, hedging instruments and compliance.

Investors plowed record levels of money into bitcoin futures at regulated exchanges in the United States and Britain last month, hungry for a piece of the action but seeking the kind of protection that will satisfy their compliance officers.

Between March and May, bitcoin more than doubled in price, an ascent peppered by double-digit price swings reminiscent of its 2017 bubble, which was driven by smaller retail investors.

During that period, Chicago-based CME Group Inc’s average daily volumes of futures contracts climbed over seven-fold to a record $508 million in May. The number of open interest contracts - those that haven’t been settled - also hit a record.

CME said bitcoin’s price gains, and the subsequent increase in volatility, attracted new investors seeking to hedge risk.

Crypto Facilities, a London-registered platform bought this year for over $100 million by major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said bitcoin futures daily trading volumes jumped over three-fold from March to a record $84 million in May.

In a sign of the growing mainstream market, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), plans to offer bitcoin futures in the coming months through a new crypto-trading platform, Bakkt.

“It’s logical they (institutional investors) would want to be moving in this direction, especially considering their size and how much more there is at stake,” said Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange Group.

HEDGING INSTRUMENT

Futures - financial contracts that lock buyers and sellers into trading an asset at a set date and price - are seen as key components of any mature market, as they boost market liquidity and allow investors to bet on the direction of prices.

“It’s a useful hedging instrument,” said Daniel Matuszewski, head of trading at Goldman Sachs-backed crypto firm Circle. “Futures are much easier to trade, much easier to use for hedging, much easier to get leverage on.”

Playing out in the spiking demand is the emergence of a twin-track global bitcoin futures market - on “onshore” exchanges like CME and “offshore” exchanges, which are more lightly regulated and still command the bulk of the multi-billion-dollar daily market.

Onshore exchanges - those regulated in established financial centers - are usually subject to strict checks on governance, technology and client vetting. They demand a high degree of transparency.

Offshore platforms, in contrast, are typically registered in jurisdictions with less onerous rules. They tend to accept business from investors who can sign up with few checks on their identity or the provenance of their funds.

Larger investors, bound by strict compliance rules, are heading to regulated platforms in financial hubs like CME, according to industry players. Traders with more tolerance for risk - including retail investors from north Asia and companies earning money in cryptocurrency, from miners to gaming firms - use of offshore exchanges.

“Offshore exchanges aren’t really exchanges - they are more like private markets,” said Vladimir Jelisavcic of trading firm Cherokee Acquisition in New York.

‘STARS HAVE ALIGNED’

Offshore exchanges have offered bitcoin futures since as early as 2011. One of the biggest, Seychelles-registered BitMEX, said it now accounts for over 65% of global cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Trading volumes were $4.3 billion in May, it said.

BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said, however, that larger investors were being increasingly drawn to onshore exchanges like CME.

“It’s the perfect product (for bigger investors) - it’s U.S.-dollar based, they never have to touch actual bitcoin, it’s financially settled,” he said.

The launch by CME and rival Cboe Global Markets in December 2017 marked the first time mainstream exchanges offered cryptocurrency derivatives.

They initially faced tepid demand. Cboe said in March, when bitcoin languished below $4,000, that it planned to discontinue its futures, with the final contracts expiring this month.

For their part, CME’s futures have typically seen thin liquidity and high barriers to entry for smaller investors, said Ricky Li of crypto trader Altonomy in New York.

The growing gap in the market for futures from onshore exchanges is stimulating growing competition and attracting new entrants, such as ICE.

Sui Chung, head of cryptocurrency pricing products at Crypto Facilities, said compliance-wary institutional investors had been assessing the various futures products offered by regulated exchanges for some time, as they awaited a spike in prices to allow them to enter the market.

“This is the first time those stars have aligned,” he said.",2019-06-13 06:14:03+00:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/06/12/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-fatf-regulation/,"In just nine days, new rules by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) will force cryptocurrency businesses in roughly 200 countries to verify the identities of anyone sending or receiving more than $1,000 worth of digital assets, effectively nullifying their pseudonymity.

A number of US-based firms have responded by exploring the viability of a “global parallel system” that would allow the world’s cryptocurrency exchanges to share data in a bid to remain compliant, Bloomberg reports.

Hedge funds and investment firms that specialize in digital assets could experience trading delays and increased costs for making transactions.

Industry insiders have also warned of increased compliance costs, and say businesses that shirk their responsibilities could end up shutting down altogether.

Factoring in the additional costs, FATF’s new rules could end up hurting small and medium-sized enterprises that might not have the resources to implement the new legal requirements – similarly to how BitLicense affected companies back in 2015.

According to Bloomberg, services with licenses to transmit money could face increased scrutiny from local government agencies, and risk losing them altogether if they don’t comply with FATF’s rules.

Even so, countries themselves could take the hardest hit. Individual government agencies are tasked with ensuring compliance within their jurisdictions; nations that fail to comply usually end up on blacklists, eventually losing access to the global financial system.

It’s no surprise, then, that the central banks and finance ministers of G20 nations publicly pledged commitment to the FATF’s incoming guidelines at a recent summit in Japan.

In the past, cryptocurrency companies have faced heavy criticism for forcing Anti-Money-Laundering and Know-Your-Customer restrictions on their customers at the behest of government agencies – but it looks like soon they won’t even have a choice.

Bitcoin spring may very well be here, but the wider blockchain industry is facing regulatory winter. Just great!",2019-06-12,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ceo-of-major-american-vc-firm-digital-currency-group-crypto-winter-is-ending,"The crypto winter is likely to be ending, a senior executive at major American blockchain venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) said in an interview with Bloomberg Technology on June 11.

Barry Silbert, DGG founder and CEO, outlined the cyclical nature of the ups and downs of major cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC), which allegedly means that the recent surge of crypto prices would only continue.

Silbert, who is known as a serial crypto investor, specifically pointed out that bitcoin’s price dynamics have been “quite a roller coaster,” with its price having dropped 80% four times since 2011 only to hit another all-time high afterwards. Based on this — combined with the recent surge of the markets after a massive bear market of 2018 — Silbert stated that it “looks like, perhaps, we are coming out of a crypto winter and we’ve entered a crypto spring.”

The DGG executive has also pinpointed the large involvement of institutions in the crypto industry, claiming that it has grown tremendously since the last bull market in 2017, when bitcoin hit its all-time record of $20,000. Citing big institutional crypto initiatives, such as the upcoming bitcoin custody offering by Fidelity, Silbert said that the institutional involvement of 2017 compared to the current interest of institutions is “really night and day.”

Earlier this year, Silbert had predicted that the majority of digital tokens will lose their value in the long term, claiming that almost every initial coin offering (ICO) was “just an attempt to raise money but there was no use for the underlying token.”

Recently, former JPMorgan executive and current blockchain researcher Tone Vays expressed skepticism about the supposition that the crypto winter is over. In opposition to Silbert, Vays argued that the recent spike in crypto prices was mainly supported by internal capital, which he considered shaky in comparison with external money coming into the space.

Bitnovo Introduces Bitsa to Several Markets in Europe

One of the latest offerings in this niche entered the market quite recently. Bitnovo’s prepaid Visa card called Bitsa was launched a couple of months ago in addition to the platform’s Bitcards. It can be topped up with bitcoin cash (BCH), among a total of seven cryptocurrencies, and a number of other payment methods.

Since April, some European users of Bitnovo, which is a platform that trades over 20 digital currencies, can order their new Bitsa card, which can be used to pay anywhere Visa is accepted and withdraw cash from ATMs around the world. It allows holders to make online purchases, pay in brick and mortar stores and online merchants.

With Bitsa you can not only transfer money between different cards but also make payments to any financial institution within SEPA, the single euro payments area. The card employs the Verified by Visa system, so payment security shouldn’t be a problem.

To order a Bitsa card, you don’t even need to have a bank account, although you’ll be able to transfer funds to other cards and accounts. This way Bitsa provides you with easy access to financial services and that’s something the unbanked in Europe should appreciate and take advantage of.

Load Your Card With Cryptocurrencies and Vouchers

The new card offered by Bitnovo can be loaded with bank transfers, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash, vouchers as well as gift cards that are sold online. You’ll be able to request a virtual or a physical contactless Bitsa from your account. To create one, you need to provide your email address, phone number, and choose a password.

The Bitsa account and the virtual card are free, while the plastic will cost you €19.50. There is no maintenance fee and the crypto top-up with cryptocurrencies is free of charge. Purchases outside the Eurozone are charged with a 1.5% fee. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn at ATMs is 1,500 euros daily. Purchases are only limited to the balance on the card.

The Bitsa card is also currently available on Sixthcontinent.com, an Italian profit sharing platform specialized in selling gift cards in various European markets. The prepaid card can be loaded with vouchers bought from the website.

Through Sixthcontinent, the crypto card is now offered in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and it will be released in France and Germany in the near future. Commenting on the launch of the prepaid Bitsa card, Bitnovo’s Chief Marketing Officer Roberta Quintiliano told news.Bitcoin.com:

Given the outcome we are having in Italy and other European countries, and since it is a card that allows free and easy access to financial services for the unbanked, this could be a very exciting news for the crypto community.

How to Top Up Your Bitsa Card With Bitcoin Cash

Loading the Bitsa card with cryptocurrencies – BCH, BTC, LTC, DASH, XLM, XRP, and ZEC – is fast and easy. To top up your card with bitcoin cash (BCH), for example, you need to first download and install the free Bitsa app, which is available in both Google Play and the App Store.

Once you link your virtual or plastic Bitsa is with the application, or associate with your online account, you have to go to the app’s Top Up menu, choose the Cryptocurrency option and select Bitcoin Cash. You can set the amount in either BCH or EUR equivalent and then hit Continue.

The next screen will show you a summary of the transaction and a couple of payment options. You can either pay with the wallet installed on your smartphone or choose to load the card with a wallet on a different device using the generated QR code. Once the BCH amount has been sent, your electronic cash will be converted to euros.

With cryptocurrencies it will be possible to instantly top up the Bitsa prepaid card, “thus guaranteeing quick and easy access to financial services, also to the unbanked public in Italy, Spain and Portugal,” Bitnovo noted in a press release. “We are very pleased with this achievement and we are sure that it is only the first of the many steps we will take to continue to provide everyone with free access to financial services, so they will no longer be an exclusive prerogative of banks,” the Spanish company stated.

There’s been a number of developments in the ongoing Kleiman vs. Wright lawsuit lately. After Craig Wright’s sworn deposition, the plaintiffs contend that Wright’s categorical refusal to answer questions about his bitcoin addresses and his marriage(s) needs to be reevaluated. Wright’s legal team say he’s done everything possible to comply with the court’s orders but the Kleimans believe the self-proclaimed Satoshi has been stonewalling for nine months.

The First 70 Blocks and the So-Called ‘Blind Trust’

The ongoing Kleiman vs. Wright lawsuit has started to heat up as the plaintiffs want more answers from Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto. The Kleiman estate represents the now deceased David Kleiman, a security researcher that some believe may have been a member of a pseudonymous group operating under the Satoshi Nakamoto monicker. According to Ira Kleiman, his brother David’s inheritance was manipulated during a multi-year partnership with Australian native Craig Wright. More recently Wright was deposed and refused to answer questions about his current and former wife and certain questions in regard to his alleged bitcoin addresses. Wright did claim to own the addresses to the first 70 blocks mined on the Bitcoin blockchain and provided some information concerning an ostensible blind trust.

Not long after the once redacted list of bitcoin addresses was unsealed, bitcoin security specialists Wizsec researched the addresses and stated Wright’s claim of ownership was still meaningless. Moreover, one of the addresses allegedly used in the case (Wright claims the address is a forgery) was signed by the real owner on May 16, 2019. The legitimate owner of the address in question called Wright a liar and a fraud in the signed message. Wright’s legal team explained that he could provide the public addresses for the first 70 blocks, but also said: “he did not have public addresses for bitcoin that was mined after those blocks because that information is held in a blind trust.” A court filing from June 11 describes in great detail the reasons why Wright presumably cannot disclose certain information tied to the purported trust. Wright’s lawyers did emphasize to the court that “Dr. Wright is the best person to explain the complex manner by which bitcoin was mined and held in the trust.”

Describing the Blind Trust’s Complexity

According to the court document, after he mined the first 70 blocks of bitcoin, Wright allegedly designed a unique algorithm. This algorithm automated the key generation process so that after block 70 was mined, blocks that followed would be assigned to a different public address. This supposedly means the coins were mined directly into the blind trust after this scheme was implemented. The document also says that Wright disposed of all of his mining rigs used to process bitcoin blocks throughout 2009 and 2010. “[Wright] did not keep any list of the public addresses associated with the bitcoin he mined after block 70,” the document explains. “Dr. Wright ceased mining by the end of 2010 — At that time, the value of bitcoin fluctuated between $0.06 and $0.29.” The defense filing continued:

The private key needed to access the encrypted file with the data necessary to retrieve information about bitcoin Dr. Wright mined after block 70 has been split into multiple key shares (in lay terms, multiple parts) through a version of “Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm”, an algorithm created by Adi Shamir to divide a secret, such as a private encryption key, into multiple parts.

After using Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm, Wright insists that the key shares were then distributed to multiple individuals included in the blind trust. The system Wright and his partners imposed made it so no single participant could extract the information and Wright alone does not have the ability to access the encrypted file. “Dr. Wright does not know the public addresses of the bitcoin held by the trusts (i.e., the bitcoin mined by Dr. Wright in 2009 after block 70, through 2010).” Because of the blind trust complications, the document seems to suggest that Wright doesn’t have enough information to claim ownership (sign) because the keys were transferred into the blind trust with multiple owners.

Plaintiffs Don’t Buy Wright’s Argument and the Crypto Community Continues to Fact Check

However, the plaintiffs still want a comprehensive list of the public addresses of all the bitcoin Wright allegedly mined before December 2013. An order signed by the Judge shows that Wright must produce this list by June 17, 2019, and if he cannot comply the court may conduct a show cause evidentiary hearing. The defense believes that the Kleimans’ demand that “Dr. Wright authenticate every single document related to the trusts is facially overburdensome and unreasonable.”

“Dr. Wright has produced hundreds of documents related to the trusts including documents that he did not sign or prepare,” Wright’s litigation team noted on June 11.

The last few weeks of documents stemming from the Kleiman vs. Wright case has opened more doors within this seemingly never-ending rabbit hole. Wright’s recent motion, Document 187, for a protective order, was heavily redacted because he feared criminals would seek retribution against him and an unredacted footnote also showed the name, Paul Le Roux. This information opened up another rabbit hole where some people have suggested that Le Roux may have participated in designing the Bitcoin network. In addition to Le Roux being added to the story, many cryptocurrency fans watching the case from abroad have been questioning some of the statements made by Wright so far. For instance, Vin Armani from Cointext and Dustin Dreifuerst from the podcast Didyouknowcrypto.com (DYKC) asked how the coins from blocks 1-70 can be in a blind trust if he used the private key from block #1 to sign in front of Gavin Andresen.

“Craig signed a message that I chose (“Gavin’s favorite number is eleven. CSW” if I recall correctly) using the private key from block number 1,” Andresen told the public three years ago. “That signature was copied on to a clean USB stick I brought with me to London, and then validated on a brand-new laptop with a freshly downloaded copy of electrum.”

In addition to this showing, Bitcoin Foundation member Jon Matonis revealed in a blog post written on May 2, 2016, that he also witnessed the signing and verifying of messages using private keys from blocks 1 and 9. Crypto enthusiasts have further pointed out that the coins from blocks 1-70 have never moved and the blind trust story sounds extremely far-fetched. As the legal battle continues to unfold in Florida, many onlookers still think that more information will uncover some of the mysteries behind this case and whether certain particulars are true or fabricated.

From a release:

“Cathio’s platform is designed to enable all sectors of the Catholic economy to benefit from lower costs and transparent payments,” said Cathio CEO Matthew Marcolini. Former Ambassador to the Holy See and Cathio Advisor Jim Nicholson stated, “The Church is living in a time of great challenges with the laity asking, ‘What can we do?’ Well, Cathio is a lay initiative that not only strives to save the Church money, but positions it to provide greater transparency of financial transactions and the connectivity of people of good will with good works.”

It should be noted that Santorum is the CEO’s father-in-law – a bit of nepotism that can be avoided in the future if Cathio’s board were to take a vow of chastity – and that the board features Cameron Chell, chairman of ICOx Innovations. Chell and his team brought us the exciting and successful KodakCoin.

I am very excited to be part of a company dedicated to helping the Catholic Church connect with younger believers. https://t.co/OZTHPrJuyh — Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) May 31, 2019

Details of this product are slim but it looks to be a traditional fintech play with a blockchain chaser. It’s also apparently a ploy to get kids excited about Church.

“Millennials don’t carry cash, they date on apps and watch on-demand entertainment. We have to be there, we have to learn from successful tech companies, and we have to provide a universal solution that makes it easy for younger generations to engage with the Church,” wrote Santorum.

Users of the Cathio network pay 2% to run their financial transactions through the system and lets priests take donations without any of the money passing through the morally bankrupt Silicon Valley payment providers. As an added bonus the app is sort of a Moviefone for churches, allowing them to post photos and mass times on Cathio’s map.

There’s one snag, however. Blockchain, Marcolini told the Financial Times, will make it easy for parishioners to know where their donations are going. Sadly, this lack of anonymity goes in direct opposition to Christ’s teachings. You’ll recall He said:

So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Maybe they just need to use Monero?

That is the conclusion of the most detailed analysis to date of the cryptocurrency's carbon footprint. For their study, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) analyzed such data as the IPO filings of hardware manufacturers and the IP addresses of Bitcoin ""miners.""

Although Bitcoin is a virtual currency, the energy consumption associated with its use is very real. For a Bitcoin transfer to be executed and validated, a mathematical puzzle must be solved by an arbitrary computer in the global Bitcoin network. The network, which anyone can join, rewards the puzzle solvers in Bitcoin. The computing capacity used in this process -- known as Bitcoin mining -- has increased rapidly in recent years. Statistics show that it quadrupled in 2018 alone.

Consequently, the Bitcoin boom raises the question of whether the cryptocurrency is imposing an additional burden on the climate. Several studies have attempted to quantify the CO 2 emissions caused by Bitcoin mining. ""These studies are based on a number of approximations, however,"" says Christian Stoll, who conducts research at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

""Detective work"" to track down the power consumption

Therefore, a team of management sciences and informatics researchers at TUM has carried out the most detailed calculation of the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin system to date. Working like detectives, they proceeded step by step to gather conclusive data.

The team began by calculating the power consumption of the network. This depends primarily on the hardware used for Bitcoin mining. ""Today special systems are used, known as ASIC-based miners,"" explains Stoll. In 2018 the three manufacturers who control the ASIC miner market planned IPOs. The team used the mandatory IPO filings to calculate the market shares of the companies' respective products. The study also had to consider whether the mining was being done by someone running just one miner at home or in one of the large-scale ""farms"" set up in recent years by professional operators. ""In those operations, extra energy is needed just for the cooling of the data center,"" says Stoll. To investigate the orders of magnitude involved, the team used statistics released by a public pool of different miners showing the computing power of its members.

68 percent of computing power located in Asia

The researchers determined the annual electricity consumption by Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be about 46 TWh. And how much CO 2 is emitted when this energy is generated? Here, too, the research team wanted to go beyond mere estimates. The key question, therefore: Where are the miners located?

Once again, live tracking data from the mining pools provided the decisive information. ""In these groups, miners combine their computing power in order to get a quicker turn in the reward for solving puzzles -- similar to people in lottery pools,"" explains Stoll. The IP addresses in the statistics published by the two biggest pools showed that miners tend to join pools in or near their home countries. Based on these data, the team was able to localize 68 percent of the Bitcoin network computing power in Asian countries, 17 percent in European countries, and 15 percent in North America. The researchers cross-checked this conclusion against the results of another method by localizing the IP addresses of individual miners using an internet of things search engine. They then combined their results with statistics on the carbon intensity of power generation in the various countries.

""Linking large-scale mining operations to renewable energy production""

The conclusion of the study: The Bitcoin system has a carbon footprint of between 22 and 22.9 megatons per year. That is comparable to the footprint of such cities as Hamburg, Vienna or Las Vegas.

""Naturally there are bigger factors contributing to climate change. However, the carbon footprint is big enough to make it worth discussing the possibility of regulating cryptocurrency mining in regions where power generation is especially carbon-intensive,"" says Christian Stoll. ""To improve the ecological balance, one possibility might be to link more mining farms to additional renewable generating capacity.""",2019-06-19,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-13/hottest-crypto-is-up-360-this-year-and-its-name-isn-t-bitcoin,"Why did this happen?

An Indian government-initiated program is offering a course for undergraduates to learn about cryptocurrency, blockchains, and their use cases. This 12-week interactive course is free to enroll and learn from. Among the topics covered are Bitcoin basics and consensus. Meanwhile, India’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is reportedly ready.

Also read: Indian Cryptocurrency Regulation Is Ready, Official Confirms

Government-Backed Project

A learning platform called Swayam, which was initiated by the Indian Government’s Ministry of Human Resource Development, is offering a free computer science course on Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This 12-week undergraduate course entitled “Blockchain Architecture Design and Use Cases” runs from July 29 to Oct. 18. The exam will be on Nov. 17 for those wanting to obtain a certificate from the course. This is an All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) approved Faculty Development Programme (FDP) course.

Swayam describes:

The course is free to enroll and learn from. But if you want a certificate, you have to register and write the proctored exam conducted by us in person at any of the designated exam centers.

The certification exam is optional but costs Rs 1000 (~$14). It will be conducted in various cities throughout the country which will be revealed at the time of signing up. Cities that have held exams for other Swayam courses include Lucknow, Kolkata, Guwahati, Mumbai, Thane, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Thiruvananthapuram.

A similar course was previously offered in July last year and January this year through the NPTEL website, a project funded by the same ministry. 20,735 people enrolled in July last year and 14,746 enrolled in January. New NPTEL courses from the July semester onward will only be offered through the Swayam platform.

“Swayam seeks to bridge the digital divide for students who have hitherto remained untouched by the digital revolution and have not been able to join the mainstream of the knowledge economy,” its website details:

All the courses are interactive, prepared by the best teachers in the country and are available, free of cost to any learner … More than 1,000 specially chosen faculty and teachers from across the country have participated in preparing these courses.

What Students Will Learn

In the first week of the course, students will learn “Basic Crypto Primitives” and an “Introduction to Blockchain,” which includes the basics, history, architecture, and conceptualization. Basic Crypto Primitives continues through the second week when students will also learn more of the basics of Bitcoin and “Distributed Consensus.”

While the majority of the coursework focuses on code and computer science concepts, the Bitcoin Basics lectures give the full picture of Bitcoin including some limited economics and how the cryptocurrency is in competition with central banks globally. “You must limit the currency to have their value. If you put up a lot of currency in the system, it will gradually reduce the value of that particular currency,” one of the lectures explains.

In the third week, “Consensus in Bitcoin” will be taught, including the basics of proof-of-work and the role of miners. Students will also learn about permissioned blockchains which will continue to the following week. The fifth and sixth weeks will focus on hyperledger with the remaining of the course discussing applications for blockchains, including uses in government and financial services.

The reading material for the course includes “Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies” by Andreas Antonopoulos and “Blockchain” by Melanie Swan.

The course has two instructors listed: Professor Sandip Chakraborty and Dr. Praveen Jayachandran. The former is an assistant professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur); his research focuses on computer systems, distributed systems and mobile computing. The latter is a researcher and manager of the Indian Blockchain and Smart Contracts team at IBM Research.

Discussion of Indian Crypto Regulation Heats Up

This Swayam course will start one week after the Indian supreme court is scheduled to hear the cryptocurrency case. The court is expected to address the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency as well as the banking ban by the central bank on July 23.

The interministerial panel tasked with drafting the country’s cryptocurrency regulation is ready to submit its recommendations to the finance minister, according to Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg who heads the panel.

Meanwhile, there has been much speculation about what the regulation entails. Two major publications in India, Bloombergquint and the Economic Times, have claimed to know some details of the cryptocurrency bill. However, a number of industry experts have analyzed their articles and concluded differently.

The actual report containing the recommended cryptocurrency framework for India will soon be submitted to the finance minister who recently attended the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Japan where crypto asset regulations were discussed. India, along with other G20 countries, has reaffirmed that it will follow the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force which is expected to release its new Guidance for Virtual Currencies later this month.

Dubbed “Magic,” the site is touted as allowing users to “trade cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges within a single dashboard, automatically and manually.”

Notably, the exchange appears to be non-custodial, with users’ crypto holdings remaining on eight other exchange platforms. When a trade is executed, funds are transferred from those accounts to complete the transaction. To set this up, users will need to plug in APIs from their other exchanges.

In its guide to using the platform, Magic lists Binance, Kraken, Poloniex, Huobi, Bittrex, HitBtc, Exmo and Livecoin as the supported exchanges.

Two “portals” are on offer, one for normal spot trading, the other for “shadow trading,” in which a user’s trades will be set to mimic those of pro-level traders who are “ranked by the community by their trading success,” McAfee indicated in a tweeted image.

Other features include the “set and forget” ability to set buy and sell orders at the same time. Users can also use the platform to make auto trades on their behalf. There are no jurisdictional restrictions on who can use the exchange.

Regarding the security on offer, the Magic’s FAQs say that the site is hosted on “top grade” Amazon Web Service servers that come with DDoS protection and can “scale on demand.”

The site also reads: “We are only releasing this platform to the public after extensive testing and auditing processes that stretched months.”

Magic seems to have faced a DDoS attack even before launch. In a pre-launch tweet, McAfee quipped:

“McAfeeMagic.com still under attack. New I.P. address in Texas. The more this goes on, the closer we get. Amazon AWS servers are “learning” the attack and will be up shortly. Catch up on work, make out with your partner or “flash” a random stranger and video while you wait.”

It should be noted, we don’t recommend taking his advice.

Just 10 days ago, McAfee also announced he would launch a cryptocurrency dubbed the “McAfee Freedom Coin” this autumn.

Somewhat confusingly, he said at the time:

“The McAfee Freedom Coin is designed to confront the problem of exchange head-on… It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it’s natural market value is free, completely, to grow.”

However, the token does not seem to be linked to the operation of new exchange, at least not yet. The Magic site says it will use the fuel (ARB) ERC-20 token from a project called Arbitraging.

Earn Bitcoin Cash With Purse.io

Purse.io is a platform that connects crypto shoppers with anyone who wishes to exchange their Amazon gift cards for bitcoin cash. In order to participate in the program as an “Earner” you don’t need to send the actual cards to any interested buyers over the mail. Instead, all you have to do is fulfill their orders on Amazon. The platform holds the cryptocurrency needed for a purchase sent by the shopper and once the confirmation of the delivery to them is received, you will be given the agreed payout.

If you are thinking about converting your Amazon gift cards into bitcoin cash using Purse.io in this way, you should keep in mind that shoppers are expecting to receive discounts in exchange for their cryptocurrency. According to the statistics published on the site, the company has facilitated more than 300,000 orders during 2018 with an average discount of 18%.

Another way to acquire some BCH, without having to open an account with a centralized exchange, is by using Local.Bitcoin.com. It’s a recently launched global marketplace for peer to peer bitcoin cash trading focused on privacy.

The latest avalanche of news from Facebook, however, makes this lead look less convincing, as it becomes apparent that the social media giant’s blockchain project is also well underway.

After a series of indirect cues suggesting that Facebook’s long-rumored fintech initiative is in motion, a massive breakthrough came with a detailed report from The Information, which mainly relied on anonymous sources to unearth many newsworthy particulars related to the forthcoming token. A European Facebook executive validated some of the details shortly after, confirming that a white paper outlining the cryptocurrency’s essentials is set to be published on June 18. Here is what we know of the future coin’s design and governance, as well as its potential implications for the digital economy, according to some leading voices in the crypto space.

Buildup

According to The Information’s report penned by Alex Heath and Jon Victor, Facebook’s crypto project kicked off roughly a year ago when the company brought in David Marcus, former president of PayPal, to lead the charge. The e-payments giant would go on to become a major source of manpower for the initiative, enhanced with some additions of Coinbase alumni on the compliance side. In early 2019, Facebook incorporated the entire team previously employed by a blockchain startup Chainspace. MIT professor Christian Catalini has been reportedly appointed as the project’s chief economist.

Overall, staff deployed on the project is estimated to be at least a hundred strong, with some more open positions still up. In contrast to Facebook’s normally open-space culture, employees working on the blockchain initiative are reportedly concentrated in a separate building behind closed doors.

Despite earlier reports by the BBC suggesting that Facebook’s prospective cryptocurrency has been known internally as GlobalCoin, The Information’s dossier makes no mention of this label. The publication’s sources insist on another codename that has also previously been circulated in the media, Libra.

In addition to registering a company called Libra Networks in Switzerland in May, Facebook bought out the trademark from a namesake blockchain startup. TechCrunch’s Josh Constine hypothesized that the name could be wordplay on the abbreviation LIBOR, which stands for the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, a benchmark for interbank borrowing. Constine said, “LIBOR is for banks, while Libra is meant to be for the people.”

The Information’s sources revealed that Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has taken a great personal interest in the crypto project, while some others among the firm’s C-suite, such as chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and chief financial officer David Wehner, remained skeptical.

The Libra team reportedly presented three possible investment scenarios to Facebook leadership, ranging from low to high commitment, and Zuckerberg ultimately opted for the maximum investment route. Facebook CEO’s attention to building a payment system on top of the platform fits well into the proclaimed turn toward facilitating more personal and small-group forms of communication.

Token properties and uses

As a borderless currency with no transaction fees when used within the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram), the prospective coin is poised to make a considerable impact in developing countries, where the company is looking to primarily market it, according to The Information’s report.

Read more on this: Libra Project: Facebook Stablecoin Aims to Conquer Online Payments Market, Reports Suggest

While the social platform’s existing user base exceeds 2 billion people globally, a significant portion of it come from regions where traditional financial institutions are not quite reliable, and fees on cross-border remittance payments are often exorbitant. If users come to associate the digital coin in their smartphone messaging app with real value, Libra could become a game-changer in areas such as cross-border payments, casual Venmo-style transactions within friend groups and e-commerce generally, as more and more merchants join the realm of Facebook-powered social platforms to sell their goods directly.

Prominent blockchain advocate and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long, who was among the first to share her vision of Facebook’s cryptocurrency in light of the latest news, wrote in a Forbes op-ed that “Facebook’s cryptocurrency will be a powerful force for good in developing countries.” Long argued that, by providing a more reliable store-of-value than central banks, Facebook’s stablecoin would pressure financial authorities into monetary discipline.

In order to maintain value, according to The Information investigation, Facebook’s coin will be pegged not just to one currency, but to a basket of several currencies and low-risk securities. The company’s head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, Laura McCracken, has also confirmed this in an informal conversation with a reporter from German magazine WirtschaftsWoche, although nothing is known yet about the basket’s composition.

The Information’s report also specifies that Facebook plans to provide physical infrastructure — in the form of ATM-style terminals — to enable users to exchange the digital asset for fiat currencies. In addition, Facebook employees will be reportedly given an option to receive part of their salaries in the token, a detail that Gizmodo’s Victoria Song called the resurgence of the “company town dream” in the digital age.

Governance and decentralization

These days it is difficult to find a person who is not alerted to Facebook’s control of (and, sometimes, questionable practices of handling) user data. The fact that the company’s ambitions now extend to a comparable degree of control over online payments might appear sinister. Anticipating pushback from vigilant users and regulators alike, the company seems to have introduced a degree of decentralization into the way its cryptocurrency governance model is laid out.

According to The Information’s report, for the past few months, the social networking company has been talking to dozens of financial institutions and tech companies, soliciting their participation in an independent foundation tasked with the new crypto payment system’s oversight. The measure should promote trust in the system, as well as pacify antitrust regulators. Sunita Parasuraman, who has worked as Facebook’s corporate head of treasury operations, will reportedly manage the foundation’s treasury.

Unsurprisingly, the privilege of validating transactions on Facebook coin’s ledger will be reserved for a selected few. A license to operate a node on the network will reportedly cost outside entities $10 million each, and will come with a right to delegate representatives to the foundation and participate in the network’s governance. The network is expected to launch with 100 nodes, possibly with a prospect of further decentralization as more nodes join in. The Information’s sources claim that Facebook will use licensing fees to establish the initial pool of value for the coin.

It is not yet clear how node operators will be rewarded in the absence of transaction fees and The Information’s claim that Facebook is not planning to use the payment system for ad targeting. The latter notion can strain skeptics’ credulity, given the company’s business model and the wealth of valuable data on purchasing habits that the currency use will generate. One of the possible answers is the interest that will accrue from the assets underlying the token — and node operators will likely hold a lot of it.

Furthermore, Long predicted that Facebook will share the generated interest profits with all users and holders of its token in order to avoid high-profile accusations of simply pocketing it, which would immediately follow otherwise. As a collateral effect, Long writes, this might turn public attention to the issue of corporate welfare in the U.S. banking system: The Federal Reserve, it turns out, pays its member banks 2.35% for interest on excess reserves.

Regulation

Having learned the hard way how much of a trouble regulatory scrutiny can present, Facebook has been working closely with financial authorities across the board to ensure compliance. The new cryptocurrency is believed to incorporate solid identity verification and have fraud prevention mechanisms in place.

According to Long, it means that Facebook will leverage a massive “tax data honeypot” for multiple governments, which may attempt to trade regulatory latitude for a certain degree of access to this data. In the big picture, the project will likely highlight the archaic character of many extant financial regulations and set in motion processes of gradually making them more up to date. The ride, however, will be bumpy, as the launch of Facebook’s payment system will spark heated debates about privacy and corporate power in the context of money.

What to make of this?

Over in the crypto Twitter-sphere, intense debate immediately broke out, as opinion leaders began to figure out who the new coin’s immediate competition might be and whom it will obliterate. Charlie Shrem, a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, opined that Libra is a direct threat to Ripple’s XRP:

Facebook is launching their global crypto coin called “Libra”. What’s interesting is they are offering companies to pay $10m to become “validators”. If anything, it renders Ripple useless 😂. The first companies to create a LIBRA/BITCOIN exchange will make a killing! — Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) June 8, 2019

Long-time Ripple investor Kieran Kelly differed, suggesting that it is bitcoin that is now on the line:

Libra/Facebook Coin is a considerable threat to Bitcoin. XRPs main focus is as a bridging asset and on demand liquidity for banks and remittance companies. Libra sits in the same market as Bitcoin, as a direct competitor, but Facebook has a mass following unlike Bitcoin. 😬 https://t.co/PYhgMcpY3t — Kieran Kelly 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇧🇧 (@kieranmlkelly) June 9, 2019

Yet another opinion, perhaps more optimistic than most of the crypto industry, came from Mati Greenspan, a senior trade analyst at eToro, who contended that it is traditional currency that is threatened here:

Facebook coin isn't a competitor to Bitcoin, it's a competitor to the Dollar. — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 9, 2019

Weiss Ratings’ lead cryptocurrency specialist, Juan M. Villaverde, formulated the central question somewhat differently in an email to Cointelegraph:

“Is Facebook really moving into the cryptocurrency space? Or is it merely porting some crypto technology over to the traditional fintech industry?”

Villaverde sees all indications that it is going to be the latter. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing, as Facebook seems to be serious about delivering user-friendly financial services to millions of users who have virtually no other access to banking.

The fact that deployment of the company’s cryptocurrency is set to start from India, the nation with the second-largest unbanked population in the world, suggests that Facebook is ready to go in that direction. However, we should make no mistake with regard to Facebook coin’s relation to decentralized digital currencies, Villaverde said:

“Facebook is looking to provide payment services to its customers. To do so, it must act as a counterparty and custodian for every payment that goes through its platform. It must have the last word on any payment users make or seek to make. Just like a bank, credit card company or PayPal. In sum, the Facebook coin will compete with established payment processors. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are built from the ground up to disrupt them. The Facebook coin will be another layer built atop the existing financial system — another intermediary, another counterparty, plus all the corresponding risks. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are slated to render every one of those layers obsolete.”

In her op-ed, Long offered a somewhat more optimistic vision of the Libra project. She thinks that Facebook’s cryptocurrency will become a Trojan horse that will eventually benefit bitcoin:

“Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrency will likely end up being a beneficial detour on the path to broader bitcoin adoption. Bring it on!”

Facebook’s initiative, Long predicts, will dramatically increase the pace at which people learn about cryptocurrency in general, and when the general public becomes educated enough, it will likely opt for bitcoin, which is scarce, rather than Facebook’s token, which is not.",,,,,,,
